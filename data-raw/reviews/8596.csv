"TechnicNick","2011-08-04T12:25:18.84Z","Magnificent, Not Quite Perfect","First of all, I've been looking forward to this for some time and it doesn't disappoint. It's a wonderful model, it looks great, works well (mostly) and is a joy to build.<div><br></div><div>Building: An intricate assembly job, as you'd expect, with several elements I haven't seen before - this may be because I don't have many newer-style Technic sets. Even as a fan of older studded Technic, I really enjoyed putting this together - the chassis is packed with the good stuff, the purpose of some of which not being immediately obvious. Just give yourself a whole day to savour the experience.</div><div><br></div><div>There are many features here, in no particular order:</div><div><br></div><div>Engine: An inline four cylinder (wouldn't a Unimog have a six ? I'm not sure...) mounted under the cab and driven smoothly by all four wheels, albeit rather slowly. There's no gearbox, but given everything else going on here we can forgive it that.</div><div><br></div><div>Suspension: Very cleverly contrived live axles at both ends, suspended by much harder than usual coil springs. There's only one of these needed per wheel, and it's plenty - despite this model's considerable weight the springing feels about right, with a useful amount of wheel travel and an amusing lack of roll stiffness.</div><div><br></div><div>Steering: This is the only technical feature that disappoints a little. There's not much lock (which seems common with newer models...) and the wheels are considerably outboard of the pivot point, creating a wide arc of movement. This is probably caused by the gear blocks that give this model it's realistic ground clearance. The biggest problem, though, is the sloppy action of the hand-of-god control: and yes it is assembled correctly! Pity the steering wheel in the cab's a dummy...</div><div><br></div><div>Crane: This model's technical crowning glory. I'm reminded of the 8868 claw rig in the action of this and it's motor-driven pneumatics work very similarly but this does it better. The crane can be mounted either on the front or back and it will work equally well. It'll turn through about 270 degrees, lift the main boom, the second arm and open and close the jaws of the grabber very effectively. There's also a couple of manually operated stabilisers. There's hours of fun to be had with this!</div><div><br></div><div>Winch: This is a fairly simple device that'll mount on the front and is driven by the motor. It works well.</div><div><br></div><div>Cab: Gotta love the orange! It looks right as well. It also tips forward to reveal the engine by unlatching two pins at the back. I'm slightly surprised that the doors don't open but the whole thing is very nicely detailed.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall then, what we have here is a large Technic model that doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before, but it does what it does better than anything else I can remember - until you come to steer it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's worth remembering that this isn't the first Technic Lego set to look like a Unimog. The 8848 'Power Truck' from 1981 suddenly looks familiar although that was far smaller and less sophisticated. Funny thing is, this model isn't THAT big; without the crane on the back, it's the same length as an 8860 car chassis and slightly narrower, with 20% bigger wheels.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The finished model is a fine looking and working thing, and what strikes me most about it is how much better it looks in the plastic than early pictures indicated, although I've left the stickers off mine!<br><div><br></div><div>If you have around Â£160 to spare, this set is easily worth it.</div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"ajmk","2011-08-05T08:13:50.493Z","Huge model that looks better in real life","<p>I wasn't sure about this model from looking at the pictures before it was released, but as it's the new flagship Technic set I always knew I was going to have to get it. For some reason in real life it looks much better, to me at least. The box photos don't do it justice.</p><p>Comparing with last year's 8043 Motorized Excavator, this model has many more parts, but fewer power functions, and no remote control. It does, however, see the return of pneumatics, which I've always loved. The idea of using the motor to power a compressor is brilliant, although you wonder why they didn't build an airtank into the design - there's clearly space in the chassis for one.</p><p>The reason may be though that this model is primarily a reproduction of the Unimog. The suspension is a good example of this. There has been speculation that there was a mistake in the front suspension, but Technic designers have now come out and said it's supposed to be offset, because that's how it works in real life. On the model it makes no difference, as it is too heavy to steer with the suspension fully compressed, but I like that they made it as realistic as possible from an engineering perspective.</p><p>The build itself took me about 6 hours, including sorting the bits out, and I was impressed with how much fun it was for a model this size. I often get a bit fed up with the symmetry of models because you have to make sections twice but in mirror images. Obviously this is necessary as most vehicles are symmetrical (!) but with this model I didn't notice it so much during building &nbsp;- perhaps they have thought about that? There are a couple of tricky bits to the build but that's just more fun! The gearbox is not as intricate as on some other Technic models, but it doesn't need to be as several of the functions are pneumatic.</p><p>The steering is the only part of this model that I don't like. It seems to have a very wide turning circle, but without knowing the specifications of the real thing, it could be intentional and to scale.</p><p>The crane is great and the stabilisers are really effective and unlike other models where they are really just for show, on this one they matter due to the suspension and weight. Try operating the crane with them raised and you'll see!&nbsp;</p><p>For the next step in the development of pneumatics, the designers could try to come up with a valve that better controls the delivery of air to the cylinders. Then you could have much more fine control over the crane arm. If the real thing operated like this model, you would have a lot of accidents!</p>

<p>This set is brilliant and contains most of the famous Technic elements in one box - pneumatics, power functions, suspension. It's just as good as 8043, but in different ways.

"lamborghiniwafflesauce","2011-08-20T12:19:00.19Z","Greatest Technic Set of the Year, or the Greatest Ever?","<p>I have been obsessed with this set since when I saw the first very pixelated preliminary image. The new road tires really got me hooked on, and I knew this was going to be big, but who would have known that this was going to be 2040 pieces?</p><p>I waited months for this set to arrive, drooling over official pictures and exhibition/review pictures, when it finally came out in American LEGO stores.</p><h4>Price</h4>Yes, $200: That's expensive. Elsewhere: more expensive. The price always scares us, but with a great Technic flagship set, there are no regrets.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is big, and it's heavy. It was a pain carrying it from the Chicago LEGO Store all the way home. The LEGO Store bag it was in gave me blister on my fingers, that's how heavy it was.<br><p>The box has an opening flap with pretty sweet pictures and explanations of the PF/Pneumatic functions and the suspension.</p><p>The box is crammed with the numbered bags (1 for chassis, 2 for the cab, 3 for the dump bed, and 4 for the equip-tachments) and separate bags for PF M motor and battery box, and the Pneumatic pieces with hose.</p><p>There are 5 instruction booklets, high quality and easy to differentiate black from DBG. The beginning of booklet 1 is instructions on how to put batteries in the battery box (as if that wasn't obvious), info about batteries in lots of languages, and the usual ""U must bild on da table"" brainwashing.</p><p>I only encountered one error in booklet 2 where the ruler (for measuring pneumatic hoses) starts at 2.something cm. Otherwise it is easy to follow, seeing as these days the instructions are as simple as they can get.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>My goodness, parts, parts, parts! It is unbelievable how much time it takes to open all the bags and pour out the parts.</p><p>There are quite a few new and specialized parts in the Unimog. The first one to be noticed, even before opening the numbered bags, is the new road tires. My first time seeing them, they are big, big, big! They are the same size as the balloon tires that came in the 8297 Off-Roader. It was a great decision by TLG to make road tires that big, people will be mocing bigger trucks. There is the portal axle gearblock, which is made of two pieces, the gearblock and the hub, and when put together, they are mated for life. There is also a new C shaped Technic frame with a big ball joint, with a counterpart. These are like the Technic version of the old Star Wars turrets seen in Clone Wars sets. And there are new Pneumatic T-squares with axle attachment. Oh, and and extra hard 9L shock absorbers.</p><p>I got my Unimog with 16t Clutch Gears with teeth. Apparently all 16t Clutch Gears are getting a major overhaul from toothed to smooth starting with the Unimog, but mine hasn't. It means it was produced among the first...<br></p><p>Next up is the pieces in new color. There is a turntable, and flat 5 x 11 panels in never-before-seen LBG. And there is orange. The AFOL Technic community has been asking for orange for ages, and finally TLG has given them. Lots of orange beams, and beautiful orange panels.</p><p>Me, not having been up to date with Technic sets, received more ""new"" pieces to my delight. My last Technic set has been 8289 Fire Truck, and since Technic has received plenty of major overhauls. It was my first time with 3L U-Joints, CV Joints, 3L Differentials, 5 x 9 and 5 x 11 Technic Frames, clutch gears, transmission pieces, colored gears, and the dreaded blue 3L Friction Pins.<br></p><p>It was also my introduction to PF and Pneaumatics.<br></p><h4>The build</h4>The build is long, tedious, difficult, even painful, but never boring. The entire build took me 7-8 hours, the chassis alone 3 and a half. The build starts off with the center differential, then gearbox and the center part, then you add the rear suspension, then the front, final touches, add wheels, and you're done.<br>Next up is the cab, nothing special. Nice to see regular LEGO make an appearance.<br>Then the dump bed, which is so simple that you could have done it without the instructions.<br>Now the crane, that was a real pain for me. It is my first time with Pneumatics, so it was hell attaching the Pneumatic hoses.<br>The last part is the winch, which is easy.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>One word only: WOW!</p><p>And a paragraph: It is massive. You would think that being a massive set, it can't roll on it's wheels that well? Wrong. The drivetrain is so smooth that you can have ""How far can you push it"" races with it. The steering is hard, and it appears to stress axles because of the red Friction Pins with Bush in the front suspension, but hey, it's not something you can't fix. There is a slight offset in the front suspension with the panhard link, but <span style=""font-style: italic;"">it's supposed to be that way</span>.</p><p>The Pneumatic crane is amazing. It can even pick up the 7635 4WD with Horse Trailer (well, without the horse trailer) and drop it in the dump bed. The Pneumatics of the crane are jumpy and sudden, but you can make it slower by flipping the levers <span style=""font-style: italic;"">only a tiny bit</span>.</p><p>The winch is a little slow, but it can easily be fixed by switching the 24t Clutch Gear with the 8t Gear.</p><p>I have not built the B model yet, but I'm really looking forward to it, it looks gorgeous.<br></p><p></p><h4>Summary</h4>Again one word: WOW!<br>This really is the greatest Technic set for me, and I would love to see TLG top that with next year's flagship, but I'm not looking forward to that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">yet</span>, I would just enjoy my Unimog a little more.<br>I'm going to have lots of fun building all kinds of attachments for the Unimog, and maybe even completely RC it, if I get pieces for that...<br><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros-</span><br><ul><li>Biggest, baddest LEGO Technic set up to date</li><li>Over 2000 nice pieces</li><li>PF and Pneumatics combined</li><li>Nice long and interesting build</li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons</span>-<br><ul><li>Pneumatic hoses were hard to attach</li><li>Would a small trivial problem such as friction steering count as a Con? I mean, you can easily fix that...</li></ul><h4>Final Words</h4>Shut down the computer, and go get it. Yes, it's $200+. Yes, you are broke and possibly homeless. But it's worth every penny, and you won't regret buying it.<br>Let's Mog!<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"DrZeldenrustig","2011-08-16T09:18:09.18Z","You won't get disappointed!","<p>I've been looking out for this set ever since the first pictures of it showed up last febuary. Even then it didn't look as big a model as it does when you look at as a ready built model standing on your table. <br></p><p>This set is by far the most impressive Technic model i've ever laid my hands on. Maybe it's not that filled with gears, pf-motors and rc-parts and stuff like that, but it has it all: Great new parts and lots of parts in general, high playability and awesome on display.</p><p> &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The big box has 30 bags which are numbered 1 to 4 for each of the 4 modules. (1)The chassis, (2)the cabin, (3)the loading-bed, (4)the crane and the&nbsp; winch. It makes building less stressful and more fun. The 5 books with building-instructions and stickers are are sealed with a piece of cardboard which keeps them in good and neat shape. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>The newly designed parts may have a one-purpose use but the do add to the value and make the Unimog look even more like the real thing. The rest is fairly regular but the orange parts are a first to Technic-sets. <br><br><h4>The build</h4>Building the Unimog may take you quite a while but is never boring. There is always great concentration needed, because of the frequent needed turns in point of view. <br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>When your your done you get a great impressive model, that in my opinion has no equal in any set the the technic line has ever brought us. The Unimog runs quite smoothly and the one-motor-powered switchbox let you handle the pneumatic- and mechanical PTO with ease.&nbsp; <br>Okay the steering is quite hard and the turning-radius could be better, but those are problems which are easily solved.<br>There is no actual B-model but you can build a snowplow with motorized pneumatic- and manual handling from the parts from the loading-bed and crane and winch.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><h4>Summary</h4>Yes, I am a fan. <br>Get it!

"av8r1973","2011-11-16T23:33:25.217Z","Holy cow, this is a big honkin' set!","<p>Over the past two years, I've assembled over 32k pieces on over 70 sets as my collection grew. &nbsp;I bought this kit nearly immediately after it was released, but it sat on the shelf just staring at me. &nbsp;When spare time caught up with me, I succumbed to the pressure and cracked it open.</p><p><br></p><p>First impressions are important, and this one did it. &nbsp;I've been a fan of Unimogs since the early '90s when I was 4-wheelin' with them in the Arizona desert. &nbsp;Simply awesome trucks. &nbsp;The image on the box didn't necessarily look much like a Mog. &nbsp;The images were very good and showed some of the incredible engineering effort that went into this model. &nbsp;I like the box flap idea on the flagship, but it's not really necessary. &nbsp;I'm going to get it, regardless. &nbsp;Besides, it makes it hard to collapse the box. &nbsp;Another impression was the weight of the box. &nbsp;I'm not a fan of opening the LEGO box to find 10% LEGO and 90% air. &nbsp;This one seemed to be about 70% LEGO, 15% tires and 15% air.</p><p><br></p><p>I was happy to see the instructions/stickers packed in a sleeve with a cardboard backer. &nbsp;This is the first kit that did not require ironing for the instructions or an email to LEGO for that.</p><p><br></p><p>The packages were neatly labeled and instructions matched the bags very well. &nbsp;By the time the build was complete, I was only short a single 1x4 black plate for the hood. &nbsp;Not bad for over 2k pieces!! &nbsp;As another reviewer mentioned, there's an error on the ruler within the instructions for the pneumatic hose. &nbsp;It's pretty simple to figure out without it, but it's a glitch.</p><p><br></p><p>After a couple of nights of construction, I had an incredibly agile machine to play with. I also had incredibly sore thumbs from the amount of pins used. &nbsp;I rolled it over pillows and blankets just to watch the articulation in the suspension and chassis. &nbsp;I love to watch how the power is transferred from the differentials to the axles. &nbsp;Simply ingenious. &nbsp;The springs seem to be about the right tension, though the whole body sways pretty bad if you move it around much. &nbsp;Put weight in the bed and it's all over the place. &nbsp;I don't suppose torsion bars were in the cards for this model.</p><p><br></p><p>Lots of new parts! &nbsp;Besides the massive tires, there were some great chassis parts that I haven't seen before. &nbsp;They feel very sturdy and will help some folks in their MOC builds of big stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>For the price, and to follow on last year's flagship Excavator, I was hoping for remote control. &nbsp;With this complex kit, and a working 4-wheel drive system, I was hoping for at least the planned option to power it via an XL motor or two and a remote control. &nbsp;Maybe next year's flagship. &nbsp;As others mention, the crane operation is very touchy. &nbsp;I have learned to be very gentle on the levers.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Big, big, truck - over 2000 parts</li><li>Clear and easy to read instructions (easy color differentiation)</li><li>Incredibly detailed 4x4 drivetrain</li><li>Realistic axle drive system</li><li>Crane is actually usable</li><li>Very well thought out chassis architecture</li><li>Beautiful use of new components</li><li>Bright orange, and lots of it</li><li>Fun to watch suspension</li><li>Eye-catching in ANY collection</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>All in all, this set is very much worthy of flagship status and should rank as a ""must have"" on any Technic fan's list. &nbsp;There will always be a flaw or omission somewhere, and this kit is no exception. &nbsp;My opinion is that the flaws above are perfectly acceptable and do not impact my enjoyment of this kit. &nbsp;Find a way to cough up the cash and get it done. &nbsp;You won't regret it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

YES Pneumatics again","<p>I will not say much, the above reviewers covered me!</p><p>I will just give you some tips about the small problems that appear in playing test.</p><p>1st&nbsp;exchange the 24t clutch wheel from the crane, whith the 24t wheel from motor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes your air sytem more reliable, because in case of over pressure the pump will stop pumping as the motor rotation will slip on clutch. That also prevents from air losses and air system will last more!</p><p>2nd take out the 3/4 pins (4 of them) at the steering base cos they work as a ""stop"" for the steering wheel. Dont wory the tires will not touch the chasis. This reduce the turning circle.</p><p>3rd The ""Panhard rod"" offset in front suspension can easily be fixed, if you replace the piece with 2 pin holes (where the rod is connected to the wheel base)&nbsp;, with one hole. This will move 1/2 stud the whole front suspension just to center it.</p>

It's got a wide variety of parts. Obviously there's lots of beams, pins and connectors. There are a few panels for the cab and the bed, pneumatic cylinders and switches, a&nbsp;battery box, a&nbsp;motor and some gears.</p><p>Then there are the special parts; some large parts for the suspension and the four wheel drive and of course those enormous tires.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This not an easy set to build. The chassis is fairly complex with lots of gears and the crane has many tubes running down to the controls. Having said that, I built the set with my 9 year old son and we didn't have any problems; the instructions are very good.</p><p>During the build it's hard to keep track of what various parts are for with so many moving parts.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>After a few hours of building you have a big Unimog in striking orange. It has Power Take Offs front and back that can be controlled with a gearbox, a compressor with outlets front and back, and it has four wheel drive with a centre differential.</p><p>Once you start playing the shortcomings become obvious. And unfortunately there are many...</p><p>The steering is a disaster; even on a smooth table top it's very heavy and steering lock is very limited. The turning circle is probably 4 or 5 feet unlike the prototype which has very tight steering.</p><p>The support struts at the back have no mechanism at all. You simply fold or extend each of them separately with a knob. They do lock into place and provide proper support for the crane.</p><p>Controlling the motor is done with the switch on the battery box which is clumsy. I often have trouble leaving the switch in the middle, pushing it from left to right and back. At this price the set could have done with a polarity switch.</p><p>The crane isn't easy to control. Maybe an airtank (like 8868 Airtech Claw Rig had) would have helped.</p><p>The bed doesn't tip, the cab doors don't open, the bonnet doesn't open...</p><p>The suspension works better left/right than front/back. On a shelf the truck leans to one side. Lego claims that is because of the travel of the suspension arms and when the springs are fully compressed the front axle is level and centered. I would have preferred the truck to be level in the normal position and slightly off-centre when the springs are fully compressed.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So there we have it; a big truck with a realistic suspension system, a compressor and a pneumatic crane.

"Bram","2012-09-02T11:24:59.033Z","Pneumatics making a comeback in the form of a legendary Unimog","Since there are tons of review on this set, I'll point out some brief descriptions should you ever consider buying this masterpiece. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Build impressions</span><br>2048 is a lot of parts once you laid out the parts, and seems 'intimidating' for noobs who just started to get into Technic. Unlike usual Lego fashion of making huge boxes with so much empty space, the box on this set is pretty much 'crammed' full of parts..so once you open the box, you DO get what you paid for! LOL. All the parts are stored in numbered bags which correspond with the build steps that spread over five booklets. <br><br>If this is the first time you build&nbsp; a pneumatic set, this set teaches you the intricate switching valves and air lines in a Lego pneumatic system. I'm not going over the details, because I'm not going to spoil your fun 
of discovering each building steps as this masterpiece takes form. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Coffee table impressions</span><br>Finished Lego models are best observed on a coffee table and gawking yourself with their awsomeness while sipping a hot latte LOL.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Overall design </span>: I almost weep when I saw this the preliminary pics of this set. While we're used of getting Ferrari's and a fictious truck models in Technic lineup, this set is NOT just Lego model of a crane truck, it's Lego's rendition of a UGN series 400 Unimog, and licensed by Mercedes Benz. It's also huge, Technic supercar scale sized, and this is a truck, so you get the idea of how big and tall this thing is. <br><br>The use of available Lego beams and panels to mimic the distinctive UGN series's overall shape is TOP notch down to the aft mounted air intake and exhaust pipe. The new 94x 38R tires look proportional too although some have complained about the smooth 'street' tread instead of the more aggressive lugs, but I find them to be an equivalent of an all terrain tread found on real 4x4 trucks. The truck is also running a portal axle much like the real thing, with both front and rear PTO (power take off) to run the attached implements. The only downside..a serious visual downside only though, are the light bley wheels..they should be black but can be ordered on Bricklink though. <br><br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Playability</span>: The rather downside of this set is playability. Due to the heavy model and steering pivot point on the knuckle hub which is WAY off center from the front tires, the HOG steering is very heavy and stiff to turn other than smooth hard surface. Forget about&nbsp; driving this thing on carpet or rough terrain. Pity, since the suspension is so good and flexible to follow extreme endulations with ease.<br><br>It takes some practice to operate the pneumatic switch finely to control the pneumatic actuator, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to make a slow controlled movement. The poorly designed rotation points of the crane means the crane can't reach the ground or drop a load on the rear part of the bed area as the main boom can't be rotated high enough to clear the side of the bed when carrying a load. In stock form, this thing is not very good&nbsp; almost a big dissapointment.<br><br>BUT..a BIG but...you can easily lightly alter the design of the crane to suit your needs, which I did, for a MUCH improved working range and rotation points. I also realigned the suspension's panhard rods so the axles are equal left to right.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Verdict &amp; Comparison to previous flagship the 8043 Excavator?</span>: the Unimog is less playable, and lacks the genious complicated gearing mechanism and fully remote operation of the 8043. But you do get the beloved pneumatics, and pneumatics combined with air tanks are VERY powerful and quick and has 'proportional' speed according to how much you open the valves, something you don't get in linear acuator. Pneumatics has that realistic movement of a hydraulic actuator and that graceful and realistic 'hissing' noise when the valves are opened. And to top it off you get one of the best looking Unimog Lego has ever made in an official set, with MB licensing which makes it exclusive.<br><br>&nbsp;So it has some flaws, but I think that also what makes this set VERY good, as the designer leaves A LOT of room for us to improvise. I mean what fun is a perfect Technic set which leaves nothing to tinker for hours or even weeks right? The nature of the Unimog and available attachment point makes this set the most customizable set ever as it allows you to create and attach many different implements and even remotely operate it.<br><br>If you're a Technic buff like me, this is a testament for you to pursue the perfectness and is all up to you. Unlike other sets where you build and merely 'finish', when you 'finish' assembling the Unimog, the fun just begins, this thing just begs to be tinkered with.<br><br>This set will become a sought after classic in few years to come, get it now, you won't regret it, before price skyrocketted to over US$500..pretty soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,2,4
"DrFrankenstein","2012-05-14T02:34:55.07Z","Great set but not perfect","<p>The 8110 has a lot of greatness but also some noticeable shortcomings. On the plus side, the box is chock full of nice parts and reinforces the massiveness of the set right off the bat. Personally, I like the numbered bags as they save me some time in sorting (also I don't have a huge building table, so building in stages helps). The Unimog model sports some impressive looks both in scale (it's enormous) and in colors (love the new orange). The functions are also very nice, especially the modular power distribution and the drive system (three differentials).</p><p>The build was fun overall and the booklets were clear. There is one error in one of the booklets, but it is obvious to anyone building the model and is highly unlikely to trip anyone. The one part I didn't like were the multitude of color studs used in the chassis&nbsp; (yellow and red). I can guess that LEGO thought that the colored studs would help in the build process, but for me they were only resulting in a messy visual clutter that confused me and slowed my build down. The other part that I didn't like were the new stiff pneumatic hoses that were hard to attach to the valves and cylinders. The base of the crane is a tangled mess of stiff hoses that results in limited rotation and requires a lot of force at the step when we attach the crane to the base.</p><p>Playability-wise the model is ok, but not as good as it could be. The biggest problem is the impossibly stiff steering (this one is bad even by big Technic truck standards) and the limited turning radius. Luckily these two problems are easy to fix with a few basic mods:</p><p>http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=59192<br></p><p>http://technicbricks.blogspot.com/2011/02/tbs-techreview-13-8110-unimog-u400.html</p>The engine block is located beneath the cabin. The pistons move rather sluggishly when the Unimog is in motion (again, compared to previous Technic models). If this bothers you, consider changing the gears in the wheel hubs while building the chassis (you can gear up at a 3:1 rate). You have to do this early on in the build however, because getting back to the wheel hubs later on requires a lot of disassembling.<br><br>The lack of air tanks taxes the compressor pump and results in uneven control of the pneumatics. If you leave the valves in neutral position for more than a second, you can hear the compressor choking. Also, the switch on the battery box is not very precise and requires some fine touching. For this price, LEGO could have included two air tanks and a polarity switch in the model!<br><br>Finally, the finished unimog is quite heavy and lifting it up (even gently) often times results in all sorts of peripherals detaching from the chassis (for example, the rear lights, some side elements, etc). In such a massive model, it's a bad idea to leave parts around the underside edges of the chassis hanging merely on a few studs or two axles.<br><br>Overall, the Unimog is a worthy flagship model that has a lot to offer. It is fun to build and makes for an impressive display. Its off-the-box playability is not great, but improves a lot with a few mods. It's a great and satisfying set, but not an instant classic due to some glaring oversights. The previous flagship (8043) uses almost half as many pieces but is more solid and playable.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Techman","2012-06-20T20:06:26.573Z","Awesome Flagship model","<div>I got this model a year after its release because I wanted to have time to examine all the other reviews before I was to buy it. Upon my reviewing, I really was drawn to this flagship model because of its sheer size compared to other sets. This set has the highest part count to date. When I got this set for the first time, the box weighed ten pounds! The box itself was worth keeping for its detail on the flap cover and sides. The box explained the set and what features it offered. I got mine off the Lego home site while they were/are still making it available to buy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While assembling this beast, the bags are numbered. This made the building a little easier. Of course, you could mix the parts up to make a bigger pile of pieces! There are five booklets that build the main model. Bag one builds the chassis section. This took the longest because you build the drive system, suspension, and gearbox etc. This also was the more enjoyable part of the build for its complexity. I love how intricate it is. The tires themselves are large. They are in resemblance to the 8297 tires. The chassis is large in length and width. I think it is around twenty-one studs wide. You need to pay attention to the axle length and liftarm placement where I stumbled a few times. The gearbox is very cool in how the motor is able to transfer power to all the gears. The steering can be a little difficult to turn because of the red friction pins on the underside of the frame where the steering and suspension connect. But, when you drive the vehicle, it rolls smoothly and the steering works fine then. The suspension is very cool with the links and portal axles. The new shocks are awesome. The instructions are, for the most part, flawless. The ruler guide for the pneumatic tubes were off a little in my manual. This isn't a huge error and one that can be fixed.</div><div><br></div><div>Once the chassis is built, you move on to the cab which is awesome. The orange stands out as a nice color contrast to other sets. It provides a variety in pieces, both new in color and parts. The cab is basic building with good detail. The stickers are okay, but would've been more nice had they printed them on for a more rare piece. Even still, the cab is very large and does tilt forward to reveal a 4-piston engine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The back bed is made next and this is the easiest part to build because it's made mostly of panels and liftarms. You get twelve grey panels! The bed can be taken off to reveal the inside of the Unimog. Inside the chassis you can see the gearbox and where the front and rear axles transmit power to the boom and winch. They operate the boom and winch which are motorized! The pneumatic compressor is motorized which is sweet. The pump is half a stud longer than the older pump and comes in a grey color vs. the older yellow or blue style. This length probably gives more air flow through tubes. (I personally added an air tank to my set to store air pressure to help it flow efficiently). The pump does work great by itself though. The valves can be touchy at times, make sure to slowly push the lever for optimal control. The boom and winch are the final assemblies to construct before it's all complete.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Final thoughts: This set is a great flagship with lots of new pieces and ideas. I like the new orange color for the set. It is a better diverse color than the traditional yellow or red. Even though the set as a few problems, these can overlooked and fixed with minor modifications of your own. You can add an air tank or polarity switch for better control with the battery box. Despite a few concerns, the set is a huge model that has a nice display look and sure to grab anyone's attention. This set is definitely worth the $200 large for all of what it offers in play-ability and pieces. The huge part count is sure to keep you building for hours. Go get it NOW!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"technicAlex","2012-12-09T13:31:45.59Z","Definitely has flagship status","<p>My biggest problem with this set is the patronising instructions, after a few steps in I started doing one page at a time, some double pages were devoted to adding just one piece WTF?</p><p>Anyhow, the set builds into a large scale machine, everything's been covered already, but the crane desperately needs a double cylinder on the bottom to give extra control and really the stabilisers should have been pneumatic, perhaps the steering as well looking at the numbe of complaints, an air tank is on the way, i'm not sure where to mount it, as a last resort is may be in the truck bed.</p><p>However, you have to admit it's a hell of a good set, with an air tank an an extra&nbsp;piston on the crane&nbsp;it will function more satisfactorily.</p><p>As mentioned above, this new flagshipmodel really makes the size of the 8880 supercar all the more impressive considering the 17 year age gap!</p><p>Update 13.12.2012 - Air tank installed, there's a perfect space to pin it between the pump and the front/rear distrubution valve, above the rear suspension. The supsension doesn't hit the tank, it must have been intentional by the designers.

"wojio","2014-01-28T13:46:19.077Z","Has its flaws, but still great","<p>This set is great. Building it took me ~10 hrs spread over two days. Not without its flaws as I said in the title, it still has flagship quality. Built in 1:12.5 scale, it has every detail up to the inline 4 and Panhard rods. That could be expected in a licensed scale model.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Indeed a great scale model of the Unimog U400</li><li>Cheap for a licensed model</li><li>Live axle suspension and center differential</li><li>Highly customizable (now that's an Unimog model!)</li><li>The winch lifts the model before the clutch gives up</li></ul>

"LukaMull","2014-12-24T15:27:49.217Z","Awesome and big model","<p>Back in 2011 i wasn&#39;t that much into Lego, and now in 2014 I am so glad that i got my hands on this awesome large set. I&#39;ve bought the 42009 earlier so i knew what to expect in the terms of size and pieces, but even though this surprised me a lot.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is large, same size as Mobile Crane Mk.II. Nice images and features display on the cover flap. Instructions are split into more books (in this case 5) and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>What to put here?&nbsp; Tires looks awesome, and of course pneumatics (2 large and 1 small pistons and one small air pump) but unfortunately there is no air tank, which would make this set even cooler.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, obviously</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Long, interesting, and fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I was expecting this set to be big, but it is bigger than i could imagine, especially in terms of height. I really love the &quot;modular&quot; winch and crane. And the orange color is pretty cool too. It does look magnificent on display and draw attention instantly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Awesome model, but it has it&#39;s flaws. Biggest one is probably steering. It is very stiff and does what it wants rather than waht you want. And as mentioned, air tank would be awesome of this model too. But otherwise is one of the best technic sets there is, and if you can, get it, because its price will only go higher.</p>
