Im glad that the cars are printed, because imagine how much of a pain it would be to put stickers on the cars! I was a little disapointed with the building expperience, but its pretty much anything a LEGO fan has seen. Parts are great, and he has alot of playability! I don't like it because you can get him in other sets. Unless you don't plan on getting all Cars sets with him, get him.",FALSE,3,5,4,5,3
"Mathtrains","2011-06-06T10:21:06.66Z","It's NOT Just Stickers!","<p>""It's just stickers!"" Remember this quote from the first Cars movie? Well this set brings that quote to mind. Sally affectionately calls Lightning McQueen ""Stickers."" However, that this LEGO set does not let him be named that. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The size is perfect. Not too small, not too big.</li></ul><ul><li>The price is quite good for this set. A dollar cheaper would have been good.</li></ul><ul><li>He looks like Lightning McQueen! The use of special bricks really helps here.<br></li></ul><ul><li>For those who do not like stickers, he has NO stickers!&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>A great way to get Lightning McQueen without getting one of the larger sets.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I do not see why the traffic cone is needed. Unless the second movie has a larger focus on traffic cones, it is not really needed. If this raised the price by a dollar, then it should have been removed.</li></ul><ul><li>His eyes on the windshield are suffering from red eye. It is not the harsh white that is should be. <br></li></ul><ul><li>He can't be called ""Stickers"" anymore!</li></ul><ul><li>Some of the parts are very specifically molded and would be very hard to use in other things.</li><li>Not to scale with minifigures<br></li></ul><h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conclusion</span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>If you do not intend to get the larger sets, this is a must for you to get. This car is great and fits with all the other Cars 2 sets. Fans of Printed Bricks should purchase this set to encourage the sales of sets with printed bricks. While I do not mind stickers, the addition of printed bricks is nice. If the sales are good, maybe LEGO will get the idea that most people like printed bricks.<br></p><br>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,4
"LEGOSLUG","2011-09-05T00:42:11.1Z","Time to win the Piston Cup!","<p>Here's my review of the LEGO set 8200-Radiator Spring Lightning McQueen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Build:</h4><p>Building Lightning McQueen is not hard, the build will take you no longer than 5 mins, but it is a very interesting and fun build. The use of printed parts rather than stickers is a milestone, no difficulties with stickers at last.&nbsp;(Hopefully LEGO will use&nbsp;printed parts&nbsp;regularly now). The finished model looks great, the new elements give the set a streamlined, aerodynamic&nbsp;and, well,&nbsp;cool&nbsp;look.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>Pros</h4>
<p>* Lightning McQueen--Radiator Springs style.</p><p>* No Stickers.</p><p>* A Good starter set.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4><p>* No Scenery.</p><p>* A Flag would have been nice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, an OK set, not the best but a great addition to your Cars collection.&nbsp;Lightning McQueen&nbsp;goes quite well with Tow Mater, set 8201, if you want more playability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LEGOSLUG</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.

"Ernst","2011-12-18T12:23:56.177Z","A good start","<p>A nice little starting set for the Cars theme. I got this set for my 5 year old son and we built it together. It's easy to do which is a pro considering it's a child's theme. The parts are pre-printed which is good considering the age of the kids who want it. Missing is a flag or something to put on the cone.&nbsp;Playability is ok, the kids start racing with it right away. It's not to expensive so value for money is ok, â‚¬ 7,00 is a nice price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A nice set overall.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
