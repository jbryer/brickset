Its always fun to flap his windows and move them around. But the best part of him is his tow line! He can tow almost any car from the theme, but I dont think he can tow Guido and the other pit crew people. There are great parts in this set. It has alot of play value. I don't think it's that good since you can buy him in sets. Unless your not buying Cars sets with them, get it.",FALSE,3,5,4,5,3

The build is actually simple, but ofcourse it is because it is meant for kids. With this in mind, i called out my daughter and have her build it. Actually my daughter wanted to build my extra PotC 4191, but this is better practice for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build was fairly simple, easy for kids to follow and do it themselves. My daughter needed a little help but just minor instructions of (double check if those are the same with the instruction pictures?). Took her a good 15min to finish Mater and she loved it. I too loved this set, very simple and very cute. I do hope lego is leaning toward printed pieces again at there was no sticker. I was thinking because it will be very difficult for kids to put them properly. Yet that never stopped them from doing it with SW sets. In the end my daughter asked if she could have Mater, ofcourse I said yes but i will be collecting these cuty for my lego collections myself.</p>

"Duq","2011-09-03T13:48:44.017Z","He's just cute","<p>After buying the 'Ultimate Build Mater' I had to get the small version as well so I picked it up from Teso today for â‚¬5,99.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are clearly aimed at a young audience; you can't really go wrong with them.</p>
<h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">The build</h4><p>Building Mater is easy; for the most part it's like a Tiny Turbo; stacking bricks and plates on a base with a bracket front and back for a bumper. Where Mater is different is in the crane on the back and the wing mirrors that are attached with robot arms. I can see them being tricky for the youngest builders.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are mostly brown (normal reddish brown, not as dark as in the picture on this site), with some black and dark grey and a medium blue wheel arch piece. There are two parts that are exclusive to the Cars sets; the wheel arch piece with lights (like the tail lights on McQueen) and the the 2x4 tile with a 3-wide windscreen (also used for Luigi). No stickers but prints on the bumper tiles, the bricks that form the sides and the eyes on the windscreen. Unfortunately the brown pieces weren't very consistent in colour.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed Mater is just cute; he has the rusty look and he's missing a head light. Playability is of course limited at this size but with his tow hook he can tow most other Cars-cars. The wing mirrors seem a bit fragile for childrens' play but he'll still be recognisable without them.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Whether it's for the children or to brighten up your cubicle, this little Mater set is worth getting.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"gordi99","2011-06-02T23:04:41.663Z","the names Tow Mater, like tomater, without the ""ta""....","<p>This set was amazing and I bought at my local toysrus before it was even on the shelf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I loved it so much I bought 2. So anyways, the set has many pros and almost no cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=PROS=</p>
<p>-no stickers!</p>
<p>-rare hinge piece</p>
<p>-very detailed</p>
<p>-very clever reveiw mirrors</p>
<p>-crank goes up and down</p>
<p>-goes pretty far</p>
<p>-is very sturdy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=CONS=</p>
<p>-should have been a polybag.</p>
<p>-a little overpriced, but worth it</p>
<p>-thats it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, in other word, this set is awsome and if you dont like CARS, then just buy this set. Lightning mcqueen is ok, but mater has more pieces.&nbsp;A great add to a collection and is fun to roll around. Nothing beats star wars, thou. </p>

"Bram","2011-10-03T02:17:55.943Z","Small wonder!","Just as the previous reviewer, I bought this after I got the much larger ultimate build version..and for the fact that I got the 8486 Mack's team truck with McQueen kinda loner without his goofy buddy.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall impressions</span><br>Build steps are pretty much simplified, with 2 poly bags, and instruction..and wait, where's the sticker? And once you get to the end of the instruction, you can help of thinking, 'that's it??'. However, don't let the overly simplified build fool you, because this set is a small wonder! It took me less than 10 min to get it done, but what a sight to behold. Having owned the larger ultimate build Mater, I was expecting this tiny one as a generic version. Boy was I wrong, the designers had done a splendid job of recreating Mater in a smaller version leaving all his characteristics intact, such as the exposed engine with the rounded filter, missing headlights, a towing boom (duh, obvious!) and of course the side mirrors. I couldn't remember seeing a side mirror in a 4 wide vehicle before.&nbsp; The utilization of the robot arm is pure genius and effective! To achieve the typical dual rear wheel stance, a narrow and wide tires are used. To top it off, all the parts are printed. So yea it's THAT good &amp; detail! <br><br>Pros: <br>- Well detailed<br>-Build is so simple you can dismantle and rebuild it again in a few minutes and repeat doing that with younger member of the family without worrying of missing parts.<br>- Printed parts<br>- Looks like Mater...just ask any 3 y/o..they'll tell you it's Mater alright. My 3 y/o daughter agrees too! And kids are usually honest..if it looks bad, they'll tell you..<br>- Tow hook 'latches' under McQueen's front end..so you can recreate any play scenes between these two.<br><br>Cons:<br>- Non really...other than this set comes in other bigger sets too in the 2011 Cars lineup..so if you buy this set and decided to buy a bigger set such as Flo's V8 Cafe and Spy Jet escape...you'll end up with a bunch of Maters ..again that's not necessarily a bad thing..not to me at least.

<ul><li>-Technic bricks mixed with original LEGO bricks</li><li>-Fun building, playing with</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-A little bit pricey, could have been cheaper.</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Again, I enjoying building and playing with this set. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 9.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"Topcop999","2012-10-09T09:34:42.763Z","Very cute and well designed!","<p>I saw this in my local Asda and had to buy it now I'll tell you why...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very nice scale. (Tiny turbo scale)</li><li>ALL printed pieces.</li><li>Easily&nbsp;recognisable&nbsp;as the Disney&nbsp;character.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Bit expensive for what it is but hey its&nbsp;licensed.</li></ul>
<p>...If your a Cars fan I&nbsp;wouldn't miss this for the world its only a small price to pay for such a detailed, accurate model of one of the most iconic&nbsp;characters&nbsp;from Cars.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-19T13:01:32.543Z","It's Mater","<p>Set #8201 Classic Mater: That's what the box called him so that's what he is. This is one of the Impulse Sized single-release CARS character sets from the first year of LEGO CARS Theme. There really isn't much to say about it, honestly.</p>
<p>This version of Mater is seen in other, larger sets of that same year so there aren't even any unique printing elements to him. He's pretty much a cheap alternative to getting the larger sets for children and fans to own Mater as seen in Radiator Springs. I think it would have been more interesting if they'd perhaps at least offered up a unique printing angle. Since this is Mater from the first film it might have been nice to see Mater in Dinoco Blue to simulate the horrible nightmare McQueen experiences during the first film.</p>
<p>Overall though it's not a bad little set, just plain and uninspired. The build is simple, straightforward and the same method as all of the other versions of Mater LEGO has made, he rolls quite nicely, features all of the same printed elements as other Mater models in other sets, the eyes, rusty bumper, toothy grin and Tow Mater bricks on either side. I'd say if you already own this version of Mater you can easily skip this set, if you're aiming to complete the entire CARS Theme 100% you'll need to pick him up and in the end he's not that bad. Just not unique. Still fun to play with though.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3
