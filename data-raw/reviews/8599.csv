"Legolover9531","2011-12-16T16:24:37.333Z","Cute fun little pit stop","<p>This is a neat little set! I like it because it has Guido and Luigi for a cheap price, and the pit stop is nice. A little less playability here compared to other Cars sets. It was an easy build, and the parts are nice for a collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Cars</p>
<p>Shrine</p>
<p>Great price</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Stop sign should of been better</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great set for anyone, IMO.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Duq","2011-12-22T08:39:04.667Z","Cute cars, shame about the extras","<p>Luigi and Guido the pit crew in the Cars movies. They are lovable characters in the movie and this set definitely does them justice.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>There's not much to say about the instructions. These are easy sets to build and with 40 pages covering a mere 147 parts you really can't go wrong.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Small as the set is the parts come in two numbered bags, one for the cars and one for the accessories. The parts that 'make' the characters, the eyes and mouths, are printed while the flags and signs of the accessories are all stickers. Apart from the slopes that make up Luigi's windscreen and the smooth hub caps there are no Cars-specific parts.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This set is easy to build, even for the youngest builders. Luigi's front and rear are on brackets, other than that it's stacking pieces with a few pieces in clips.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Luigi and Guido just look great. Luigi in particular is very cleverly done, using frying pans for his headset and a Technic towball pin for the microphone (which should be on his other side by the way). Guido is also well done at only 4 studs long.</p><p>The accessories are less impressive. The fuel tank with Stop sign makes sense and looks decent. The portal thing looks like a bit of an afterthought. Sure, it looks kinda Japanese and it contains some nice parts but it's not great. The strip with two finish flags is completely obsolete. I would have preferred a slightly cheaper set without this bit.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>After Mater these are the cutest characters in the range and their studded representations are really well done. It's a little pricey but we're used to that now for licensed sets.</p><p>There are no moving parts so the only play option is to drive them around but I'm sure the kids won't mind. For adults Luigi and Guido will look great on a bookshelf and the accessories contain handy parts for your own models.</p><p>Just go and buy this set, you won't regret it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2

<p>This set comes in a $20 sized box, the size you&#39;d expect, and has one instruction booklet if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>This set comes with a good amount of parts for the price, especially the parts for the two cars, which is why I bought this set.</p>

<p>Since this is a Cars 2 set, it doesn&#39;t include minifigures&nbsp;but rather cars. This is the cheapest way to get Luigi and Guido and I highly recommend this set if you do not have these cars for your Cars collection.</p>

<p>The build is nothing special, just a little pit stop to display your cars at along with a part of the edge of the race track.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great little set. I have most of the Cars sets and this is one of my favorites.</p>
