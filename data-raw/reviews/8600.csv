"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-19T08:34:54.037Z","LEGO Cars - World Grand Prix Racing Rivalry Review","This is my first LEGO Cars set which I got and it's better than I thought. It's a great build and it's fun to play with. We also get a few stickers which we need to put on. What really surprised me was that we didn't get any stickers for the two cars. The cars look really neat and they've much better pieces which we've used to see in the LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) theme. This set is also good for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (my own creations) and/or brickfilms. It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Duq","2011-12-22T20:53:43.94Z","They may be champions but that doesn't make it a great set","<p>Lightning McQueen is the star of the Cars movies and Francesco is his rival in the Italian round of the World Grand Prix in the second movie. They deserve better than this set...</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>Like set 8206 that I reviewed earlier there's not much to say about the instructions; 40 A5-size pages to put 136 pieces together means you can't really go wrong.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are mainly plates and tiles with a few bricks for the start/finish portal. Colours are mainly red and white, with a little green for Francesco and some grey for the finish structure. A few parts stand out. First there's the Cars fender piece in red for McQueen. Then there's the nose of McQueen and his entire top half in one big piece each. The nose and front wing section of Francesco are also one single piece. Finally there are McQueens beautiful golden spoked wheels. The parts for the cars are printed, the flags, clock and shield on the finish portal are stickers.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building the cars and the finish is nice and simple for young builders but disappointing for anyone with some experience. Francesco's nose is one complete piece. Using two normal 1x4 curved slope pieces and a 1x4 plate would have given nearly the same effect, except for the slight curve where his mouth is.</p><p>Building McQueen is even more disappointing with only three pieces forming nearly the entire body; nose, windows and roof, and rear fenders.</p><p>The finish structure is very easy to build; two strips with red and white tiles, two columns and a bridge section.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Let's start with the good news: the start/finish portal looks the part; it has the green and red lights for the start and a checkered flag for the finish.</p><p>Francesco looks like an open wheel formula racer but that's about it. For some reason the air intake extends over his head, which looks odd, and there is no detailing at the back.</p><p>The front and top of McQueen are sculpted pieces so what could be wrong with him? Well, that leaves side and back and both are bad. The back isn't too bad but just doesn't look like the car in the movie. The big problem with this car are the sides. They are printed 2x4 tiles stuck on the side of the car and that's the problem. They don't blend in, they look like what they are - billboards stuck to the side of the car. Because of the way they're put on they also sit 1/4 plate too high. That doesn't sound like much but it's definitely visible and it looks bad.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>None of the aesthetic issues will bother the target audience; to 5-9 year old boys they will look like Lightning McQueen and Francesco from the movie and they'll go really fast around the room.</p><p>For AFOLs though these two cars are disappointing. They're just not in the same league as Mater, Luigi and Guido.</p><p>As a parts pack this set is too expensive although it's the cheapest set that has McQueens golden wheels.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,2

<p>The Lego cars two grand prix racing rivalry is a great set all around .</p>

<p>Characters-</p>

<p>The lightning McQueen build has many interesting snot techniques and has a multitude of printed elements unlike the 2017 juniors one this one feels as if you are actually building something . The Francesco is much of the same as he is a substantial build with a lot less&nbsp;printed pieces but has still got tricky angles captured very well .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The side build is just an allinol advertisement built with a sticker and snot technique . The main build is a finish line with a suggested side of the raceway , the bridge type build has a sturdy design with technic axles going through the main supports the very top has a depiction the go lights and a very nice Italian flag sticker and a racing flag .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this a great all around set with iconic characters and a well done build and with that in mind I recommend it .</p>
