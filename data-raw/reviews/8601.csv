<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I did and I think the price tag of $15 is just a bit too expensive for it. The two Cars (minifigures?) of Mater and who ever the Fushia colored one is feature printed parts for the eyes and mouths, back ends on them. They were fairly solid and easy to build like any LEGO car is. These though I also bundled up and donated to my daughter's preschool as I don't care for the look of the Cars ""minifigures"" you get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Providing something of an inconsistant experience, the Computer Console area with the big radar dish and weapons storage, there's stickers that need to used. So love or hate the stickers, they're here. This part I kept for parts and threw in the parts pile for MOCs along with the tommy guns Mater is shown having. It just doesn't seem right if the Cars are printed and then the rest is stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sets will probably make more sense once the movie is out. What I've seen of the trailers looks like they're doing a combining of Bonds/Spy movie with Tokyo Drift Fast &amp; Furious.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>No stickers on Mater or Holly Shiftwell<br></li><li>Spare wheel for Holly, spare front wheel for Mater<br></li><li>Some nice pieces (dish, 90<font face=""Times New Roman, serif"">Â°</font> corner bricks, 1x4 brick with studs on side)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers</li><li>Stickers</li></ul>
<p>Although a small Mater appealed to me, I was really interested in the yellow ""danger"" brick and yellow/black striped tile. Unfortunately it turns out that they were both stickers, along with all of the computer screens/buttons/etc. This is not clear on the picture on the box (the computer stuff you can tell, and it's just barely noticeable on the striped piece, but I can't see any evidence of the danger brick not being printed).</p><p>LEGO sets with stickers should come with warnings on the box!</p><p>There were a few extra parts, but one part not included that would have been nice would be a 1x2 tile for Holly if you want to remove the ""display screen"" on her hood.</p><p>I paid CDN$19.99, which is around CDN$0.17 per piece, it's not the cheapest set, but not too bad for a licensed set.</p><p>I rated the set mostly pretty high, but the stickers really annoyed me, impacting my overall rating.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,5,4
"callum43","2011-08-06T15:12:53.007Z","Oh you've got to be kiddin me","<p>Well not what I was hoping at all. Holly shiftwell is the best part of the set.Just a nice simple car.Mator is ok the hook feature is fantastic its the only function i've been playing with.</p>
<p>The spy station is terrible and thats all there is to say about this set.</p>
<p>Overall I would NOT recomend this to a friend.</p>

"Legolover9531","2011-12-16T16:30:53.823Z","Great Set For Parts, Nothing Else Special","<p>I was disappointed with this set. Mater and Holley are nice, along with the parts. Other than that, I was very disappointed. It was made like it was suppose to be an add-on to the plane. There was no playability whatsoever.&nbsp;LEGO should of really expanded it with more peices and stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>The Cars</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Everything else</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your collecting parts, get this set, but for&nbsp;everyone else it's a pass.</p>",TRUE,2,5,2,2,2
