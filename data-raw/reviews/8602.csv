However, even with the cars- the boat is not very easy to play with. For example, the Professor Z can barely fit on the back part of the boat (as seen in the picture). The boat often tips over while playing with it, or even just on a flat surface. The Finn McMissile car is a good reason to get this- seeing that it is probably the only set to get it that is under, say $40. Only but this set if it's on sale of 20% or more, I say.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3
