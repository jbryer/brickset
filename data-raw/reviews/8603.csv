"Bram","2011-08-14T12:57:48.92Z","Size does matter","I bought this right after I got #8677 Ultimate Build Mater...he seems kinda lonely without his red racecar friend LOL. I'll give my brief impression of this set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post build impression</span><br>Compared to the smaller McQueen, this one is huge, but in scale favorably with the Ultimate Build Mater.The overall proportion is spot on, much like Mater, you can tell it's McQueen. This set depicts McQueen's form in the World Grand Prix, so he's no longer an American NASCAR racer, but more of a European GT racer with that huge GT 'wing/ironing board' spoiler, ultra low-profile tires and large wheels. Just Google ""FIA GT2"", you'll know what I mean. The designer even added detail such as the rear diffuser&nbsp; beneath the rear bumper. Due to its size the, designer had done a pretty good job around the frontal are too, such as 'dimples' around McQueen's mouth, so he has a slight 3D facial expression too instead of just a printed 'smile'. <br><br>Due to the printed parts being only the eyes and mouth, the fancy flame graphic is done with stickers...LOTS of them. But stickers don't bother me, especially on a racecar! LOL<br><br>Ouch almost forgot about GUIDO!! He comes as a bonus in this set, sadly of a smaller scale similar to regular Cars 2 sets, so he's merely a flag holder, and won't be able to change McQueen's ultimate sized tires. But, he looks good as a display piece next to his giant friend, so no big deal here. Lego should make ultimate build Guido...really soon, before I MOC-ed my own LOL!<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building tips</span>: <br>

-It's best to lineup the stickers, so the lightning and flame graphics 
appear 'contiguous' across each tiles/parts, and try to minimize the 
gaps between them for a neater look. <br>

-For display purposes, it's good idea to press the wheels firmly against
 the 1/2 Technic bushes. This will add a slight rolling resistance and 
prevent McQueen wandering off the shelf. No&nbsp; joke!<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kids</span> : younger crowd may find it tough to apply those stickers. It's more of a display piece, and less resilient to bumps and crashes. But it offers an interesting challenge to the 'easy' smaller sized McQueen, a good way to practice your brick building skills without breaking your parents' bank. :D<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">AFOLs</span>:This set is a true old fashioned brick building masterpiece. All the parts are regular bricks and plates, which is 'sculpted' to form McQueen's overall body shape. No fancy 'specialized' parts found on the smaller McQueen.&nbsp; Despite its lack of curves due to brick limitations, coincidently that's also what makes this set SO good, and sets it apart to other newer sets. For once in quite a while, I feel like building a 'true' LEGO set which upholds LEGO's principal classic brick building method, I'll give it 5/5!<br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
