I own every cars sets and the ultimate builds are greatly detailed and this set is no exception. The truck features a very accurate interior layout similar to the movie. Even the telephone says Harv on it within the sticker. The way it opens up makes it easy to display and view the nice details. A must have for any Cars movie fan!!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Bram","2011-09-08T00:20:47.577Z","McQueen's 'Ride' on the open highway....","This set is one of few Lego Cars 2 sets that is based on the original Cars (1st) movie, which is IMO the better one. Most race car teams travel between race events in a specialized vehicle called a race transporter, other than the car itself, also carries the equipment, crew and other necessary items required during a race..basically what 'Mack' character is, McQueen's race transporter! I'll give my brief opinion of this set...<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Build impression</span><br>Once you open the big box, there are four numbered bags, which in usual Lego manners, correspond with the instruction booklet, so build steps are pretty much simplified and straightforward. Two instruction booklets,huge A5 sized sticker sheet and a 6 x 16 plate loose in the box.<br>Bag #1 : McQueen, tool rack, cones and flags<br>Bag #2: Mack (tractor head)<br>Bag #3: Trailer box, interior<br>Bag #4: Trailer undercarriage, stickering etc.<br><br>While Mack is pretty much an ordinary 6 wide truck, the real highlight of the build is the unusual 7 wide trailer, which is done through some strategic placements of bricks and plates. If this is the first time you build an odd numbered width vehicle, this set 'teaches' you some of the basics. Most of the parts in the box go to the trailer because of this, so the trailer is quite heavy once built. Oh yes..stickers...there are lots of them, I've yet to see as many stickers in a set, and due to their size, it's quite tricky to apply them smoothly, so you need some skills and patience. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Here's a tip for a smooth wrinkle/bubble free sticker application:</span><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">- dillute few drops of mild dishwashing detergent in small bowl of water.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">- dip the sticker in there before applying them onto the Lego bricks.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">- squidgy the water out from underneath the stickers,making sure no air bubbles are trapped underneath. let dry. Voila!</span><br><br>This 'wet transfer' will temporarily decrease the tackiness of the adhesive, allowing you to position and line them up easily without ruining them.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post build impression</span><br>1. Tractor : As an automotive enthusiast, I can say that Mack here is spot on. He's one of few Cars character that's entirely based on a real vehicle. 'Mack', is derrived from a late 80's Mack Superliner RW class 8 truck if you're wondering. The unique design of the cab also mimics 'trucker caps' that are worn by truck drivers, so he's got that typical American midwest truckers' attitude..,""that's a big 10-4, comin in loud and proud,yeehaaw!""<br><br>2. Trailer: The highlite of this set is definitely the trailer! The first thing you'll notice, it's huge! There's a reason for that...it serves as a 'sleeping quarter' for Mc Queen, loaded with amenities such as huge 4x4 flat TV, intercom with 'Harv' online, and a tool rack. There are still an empty space towards the front of the trailer, so you can modify it to store some spare tires. The opening feature of the trailer is BEYOND awesome,to show the interior and adds some playability too. <br><br>3. McQueen: McQueen is..comparably tiny,in a sensible 'next to an 18 wheeler' kind of way LOL. He's also an 'exclusive' meaning you wont find similar McQueen in other sets with the original ""Rust Eze' prints. All the parts are nicely printed.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span><br>Pros:<br>- This huge 18 wheeler will make a huge scene on your Cars 2 layout.<br>- Biggest vehicle on the Cars 2 lineup<br>- Infinite playability...you can think of recreating any scene from the Cars movie.<br>- Possibly the most collectible vehicle set in the 2011 Cars lineup.<br>- Fits on regular City roadplates.<br>- Looks great and imposing on display<br><br>Cons<br>- You need to apply those darn stickers..otherwise it's just a 'soulless' big red box.<br>- Stickers can be tough to apply for younger fans.<br><br>As a AFOL I'll give this set 9.5/10, for collectibility, exclusivity and playability. A must buy for diehard Cars fans, young and old! LOL.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"rinaldo","2011-12-12T10:41:28.39Z","Very nice Disney Cars SET: the 8486","<p>
 The object of this article is the set review of LEGO 8486 from the CARS series, in particular of Mack Trucks , presented in the 2011 catalog.</p>
<p>
 The set consists of Mack (Truck), the trailer (fully opened to house Lightning Mcqueen), Lightning McQueen version Cars1, a toolbox and a bowling pin.</p>
<p>
 The set is sold in a box of medium size, inside there are three envelopes containing the brick, a 16x6 plate , and two instruction booklets to realize respectively Lightning Mcqueen with Mack , and the trailer, said all suitable for children over seven years.</p>
<p>
 The assembly continues with the envelope No. 1, we start with the place without any problems Lightning McQueen in the film version CARS 1 , ie with the angular rear wing and the sponsor Rusteze (note that this version of Lightning Mcqueen is present only in this set). The result is' very nice, but want to be critical, it makes extensive use of brick specially created to make the bonnet, the cockpit and the rear (which happens to all characters from the LEGO CARS ); completed Lightning Mcqueen, you switch to the production of Mack and in particular to his truck.</p>
<p>
 Its assembly proceeds smoothly with the use of various types of brick without the use of vertical plate or pieces made ??specifically. The end result is nice, the motor vehicle is well proportioned and has a width of six stud, the only criticism in this case I would move, I find mirrors are addressed to small and low, and the visor of his cap to Mack that he could be realized in a more harmonious.</p>
<p>
 At this point you pass the envelope No. 2 to build the trailer / hospitality of Lightning Mcqueen . The speciality of trailer assembly is that to accommodate the Lightning mcqueen the width was set equal to seven stud , so as there are no catalog LEGO pieces with this dimension, the assembly is the bottom that goes to the upper Always approaching plate width six stud with a plate of laghezza one , also in the case of the roof, as this is hinged and then opened to better accommodate Lightning inside, there is a superposition of horizontal plate to cover the entire length, which returns a thickness of two and a structure with good rigidity.</p>
<p>
 Very beautiful and playable also found the system to accommodate the best Lightning Mcqueen in it, in fact, the back door of the trailer flips and becomes the main access to Lightning Mcqueen also hinged to the roof as well, there is also hinged on the left wall rotates on itself completely. So in total, the trailer has three hinge systems that allow free access to all its internal parts.</p>
<p>
 What I did not like of the trailer structure was the extensive use of vertical plate in place of brick, and the only reason that comes to mind is the desire to significantly reduce the number of bricks used in the set, in fact, all the vertical walls of the trailer are made ??with this type of plate.</p>
<p>
 Completed tractor and trailer, we have to unite them, and here I think there was another flaw of the designers of this beautiful set, in fact, the hook is made by means of a plate with vertical shaft that goes under the trailer and crashed into a round plate with a hole in the trailer, going to make a self-latching / Sganga quite fragile.</p>
<p>
 Once assembled tractor and trailer, Mack , looks great though, very nice set itself as a sort of set intermediate between simple ones like the various LEGO 8423 , 8424 , 8426 Delux and the series that LEGO 8484 , 8677 , 8678 .<br>
 At the end of the assembly I believe are worth noting:</p>
<p>
 PRO</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  &nbsp;Harmony of the form compliance withe the original model</li>
 <li>
  Tractor made with care</li>
 <li>
  Trailer that could be full opened through three systems hinges on the walls</li>
 <li>
  Extensive use of brick in the trailer with smooth surface of the hinges</li>
 <li>
  Lightning Mcqueen version CARS1</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <br>
 AGAINST</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Mack's low and small mirrors</li>
 <li>
  Mack improved visor</li>
 <li>
  Extensive use of vertical plate for the trailer</li>
 <li>
  Hook this system / release of the trailer to the tractor unit</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <br>
 CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
 This is a set of&nbsp; LEGO , very nice and playable with the possibility of fully open the trailer to settle into Lightning McQueen.</p>
<p>
 Overall Rating<br>
 GOOD</p>
