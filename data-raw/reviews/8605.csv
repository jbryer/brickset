licensed set. For the most part, the cars are spot on to the films, but Flo's rear end could have been done far better.<br> <br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>A bit repetitive, especially the cafe itself, but there isn't enough variation in the builds of the cars either.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Lots
 of parts that are new to my collection, too many to list.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>Not a good as other licensed sets I have seen built, but the slammer is a nice touch.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>Ouch. I guess the licensing cost a bit much on this one and the price reflects that.<br> <br><h4>Overall:</h4>Slightly repetitive build and mid-range playability, but the finished product is excellent.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3

 those of you who are both familiar with and fans of the Cars movie, 
then this set is a definite must have. It is a little elementary given 
the target age group, but it's also a very well thought out set and one 
that continues the trend of excellence that we've all come to expect 
from the Lego Group.<br><br></span><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Minifigures<br>None
 but let's face it, we didn't really expect any did we? In some ways, 
this may discourage general buyers from this theme, given that the 
minifigures are a major attraction but the number of characters you get 
in this set nearly makes up for it. The down side of course is that 
you'd probably need to be a ""Cars"" fan to truly appreciate them.<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Build<br>Very,
 simple. Almost elementary in terms of building the Cars - the Cafe, Car
 Wash and Gas Station are a little more challenging with some ""Technic"" 
elements involved but still relatively easy. One good thing is the 
number of new pieces in this set that go towards the construction of the
 ""cars"" and the fact that these bricks are printed!! There are also a 
few stickers that need to be placed when you come to the building, but 
nothing that will cause too much concern.<br>The parts come in 4 main bags -<br>Bag 1 - McQueen, Mater and Flo<br>Bag 2 - Sally, Filmore, Sarge<br>Bag 3 - Gas station and Car Wash<br>Bag 4 - Cafe<br>Overall,
 the build isn't really challenging and may be a little boring for older
 builders. Having said that, it's a good build for those in the target 
age group (7-12) 7/10<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Design<br>Excellent.
 Lego couldn't have done a better done with the design of each 
Character. Each is extremely accurate and does the film justice. The 
person who designed this set truly deserves to be applauded. In 
addition, I'm not completely sure but I think there are some new colors 
that have been introduced in this theme, in particular, Sarge Flo and 
Filmore. Just brilliant! 9/10.<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Pricing<br>This
 set is actually very expensive in my country - but relatively cheap in 
the U.S. selling for less than half of what I'm expected to pay. From a 
U.S. perspective, I'd say that the price is very good - an 8/10 - but 
from and Australian point of view, the pricing gets a 4/10. I mean, I 
paid double, so it makes sense that the rating should halve, right?</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Problems<br>The
 main problem that I see with this set, and indeed with this theme, is 
that it would only really appeal to ""Cars"" fans and so, it's target 
audience is rather limited. There are some new pieces which is great, 
but a lot are printed which means that they can't be reused in any of 
your own creations. In fact, a lot of these bricks are restricted to 
being used within the ""Cars"" theme itself. In addition, I would have 
like to have seen Doc Hudson added to this set, but maybe he's been 
saved for a later set.......<br><br></span></div><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Overall,
 this is a very good set but probably only ""Cars"" fans or children would
 be interested in it. It's an excellent set for children in fact, as 
it's tailor made to suit them, but for adults, you'd find the build 
uninspiring and probably get bored of this set rather quickly.<br>I'd 
probably say that this is a selective buy - one that will light up the 
faces of children, but leave adults somewhat feeling a little empty. 
7/10 overall.</span>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
