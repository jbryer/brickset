Miles Axlerod would have to be my favourite from the set.<br> <br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>The vehicles are fun to build, but the tower is incredibly boring and repetitive.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Lots

 of parts that are new to my collection, not least a heap of tan parts.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>OK. You can shoot Finn out of the top level of the tower, open the doors in the bottom so Professor Z can leave and winch Mater up the side.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>Far too expensive! AUD$129 is not good enough, outrageous in fact!<br><br><h4>Overall:</h4>Nice cars, boring tower. Enough said.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,2

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box art looks just fine, showing all the stuffs you can do, and the set comes with 2 instruction booklets, and the box is HUGE!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>there are A LOT of parts. i mean, A LOT!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>there are a total of 7 &quot; minifigures &quot;. well, they are not really, they are mostly cars. holly shiftwell&nbsp;can change its sides to wings, professor Z&#39;s monocle can move, and the cars can stick on the crane.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build is really long. it took me 2 hours to build this. of course, i did some breaks too. but i liked building the big ben!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>the completed model looks amazing. the big ben is good for any city you build. and the cars are good for just - regular cars you can interact with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>this set is really good, comes with a lot of pieces, a lot of cars and a heck of a big building. so, i recommend&nbsp;it to any lego&nbsp;and cars series fan!</p>
