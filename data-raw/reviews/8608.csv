"Monty","2011-06-01T17:53:54.103Z","Not Bad Mate","<p>I have wanted this set ever since&nbsp;I saw it announced. I am still in love with American wreckers/tow trucks (see my reviews of 8285) and this is no exception. I picked up the small Mater last week at Toys R Us, but they only had Ultimate Build Lightning McQueen. Still nothing on Sunday afternoon, but today success at Argos. I understand the set is to be an Argos exclusive in the&nbsp;U.K..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts come in two bags so you can make up the first bag before opening the second. It is a mix of Technic parts and connectors and&nbsp;""normal"" bricks, plates and tiles. It is&nbsp;not a lengthy or complex build, but enjoyable and it is quite sturdy. The set is mainly brown, but you get some parts in rare colours&nbsp;so if you want it as a source of spares it has some good colours/parts combos. Some odd colours are used inside and other places, and given that they do have 6x1 and 2x1 tiles in the set it is a pity they used normal studded equivalent plates for the area infront of the windscreen next to a plate on the opposite side to the rocket targeting sight&nbsp;and in front of the engine. The front bumper below the teeth tile would be better as the equivalent tile too. The crane gib seems to be a new specialist part, but it may already be in sets&nbsp;I don't have.</p>
<p>The details are made up of printed eyes and teeth and (unfortunately, unlike the small Mater) stickers for the doors - a top (Tow Mater) and a bottom (Towing Garage, Radiator Springs) one for each door. There is&nbsp;one for the fuel filler and one for the chevrons on the the rear warning panel. The stickers do seem to be of a better quality than in the past - being clear plastic rather than paper based, so&nbsp;I hope they will not begin to peel and disintegrate after a year or so like&nbsp;I have had happen on other sets -&nbsp; I guess time will tell.</p>
<p>As you put it together, with those curves, it really does have a 1950's&nbsp;look about it - I think when finished it looks great, but could probably benefit from a few tweaks like the ones above.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the rocket sight and as&nbsp;I have not seen the new movie,&nbsp;I am not sure what these are about, but there is a rocket on the back which looks like a red and white road cone, and on the sight in small letters it has some numbers and&nbsp;""Target"" with a line&nbsp;to a dot showing where the target (whatever it is) is located. </p>
<p>In terms of playability it is a toy truck with no steering and you can flick fire the rocket, and wind the towing hook up and down and possibly tow something - although you would have to find a way of stopping the whole spool unwinding - or shorten the thread supplied to the minimum required.</p>
<p>In terms of value for money&nbsp;I am resigned to the fact that it is another franchised product that will cost more than it probably should, but i feel 20 G.B.P. would be enough rather than 26, so&nbsp;I have only given a 4 for that.</p>
<p>Overall due to price and a few things they could have done a little better, including no stickers, i feel a 4 is a fair score.</p>

"Duq","2011-06-29T18:46:44.237Z","Probably the best Cars set","<p>As soon as I saw the first pictures of this set I knew I was going to buy it. My son was big into the first film so I know the characters well. Mater is the reliable underdog and he's instantly recognisable in this set. I've bought the set today at Argos for â‚¬29,99 and I think it's well worth it.</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Let's start with the box. The front is quite full; the LEGO logo, Disney logo, Cars 2 logo, picture of Mater from the movie and then centre stage: Ultimate Build Mater. The back of the box says ""Collect Ultimate Build Lightning McQueen"". No mention of Francesco.<br></p><p>Lego has been reducing box sizes and it shows here as well; when you open the box it's fairly full. Inside are two numbered bags, four tires and an instruction book.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Obviously there's a lot of brown in this set but for Maters rusty old look there are some other colours; sand green, medium blue and dark orange. The parts themselves are mainly bricks and plates with a few special parts thrown in for good measure. <br></p><p>There are two printed parts; the windscreen with the eyes and a tile with the teeth on the front. There are also 7 stickers; two on each side of the cab, one on the target sight, one on the rear and a small one for the fuel flap. Two of the stickers on the side could probably have been printer, but the curved-top parts have never been printed. Lego doesn't seem to like round printed parts (apart from minifig heads).<br></p><p>There are no new parts in this, only some parts in a new colour and that's one of the things I like about this cars set. All the smaller sets have dedicated parts in them but this one is made from existing parts. That probably explains why at around 10c per piece this is reasonably priced for a licensed set.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>Building is straightforward but in low light the instructions are sometimes hard to read, especially the front with lots of dark brown, black and dark grey. There are a few Technic pieces for the chassis and the crane, a few pieces with studs on the sides for attaching the headlights and bumber, but other than that it's good old stacking bricks and plates.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once finished there's no mistaking: this is Mater from Radiator Springs. The printed eyes on the windscreen and teeth on the bumper help but the shape is spot on, and the faded blue and rust are cleverly done.</p><p>It's not all good though; the back is lacking a bit. The back of the cab is open, which would have been easily fixed with two more 1x6 brown bricks. The bed looks unfinished with the wheels exposed on the inside. Using narrower wheels (2 studs wide instead of the 3 wide used now) and a few more bricks would fix that.<br></p><p>Not having seen the second movie I've no idea what the rocket and target sight are for. When Mater gets his place on a bookshelf those details won't stay.</p><p>Playability isn't great; no opening doors or hood (ok, he doesn't have one) and no steering. This is obviously a display model.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So the back isn't perfect but other than that I really have no complaints about this set. It looks the part and is reasonably priced. And when you get tired of it eventually you're left with a good bunch of parts.</p><p>If you only want to buy one set from the Cars theme make sure it's Ultimate Build Mater.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"Bram","2011-07-21T12:35:55.31Z","Cars 2 set which appeals to AFOLs","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post-build impression and overall design:</span><br>It looks, well dare I say this, alive. Its sheer size (compared to the 8201) captures Mater's on-screen characteristics much better. The shape is also spot on, depicting a mid 50's Chevrolet truck, which is what Mater is based on. The realistic body on frame construction is neat..there's actually a ladder chassis underneath. To achieve a dually 'stance', the rear wheels are set 1 stud out. <br><br>Mater's signature of rusted surface is done uniquely in a combination of reddish brown,sand green,dark orange and light blue bricks/plates. These add some 'unevenness' much like a real rust, with traces of Mater's original blue paint still intact.The model rolls well..err rather too well actually. Printed parts are only the windscreen 'eyes' and 2x4 plate as the 'teeth'. However the stickers are well thought of, and never felt intrusive in any ways.<br><br>The towing cable and hook allow you to unwind, swing the hook and grab something just like in the movie LOL. The missile is useless though, it's more of a display accessories without any sort of firing mechanism, but neat in term of details nevertheless. It can be taken off, as well as the targeting sight if you want the original Mater from the 1st Cars.<br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">For kids</span> : This model consists of a lot more parts than the smaller one. It actually 'takes' time to build before you can play with it, and more challenging too. But sadly it's more fragile due to many small detail parts if you play roughly, and the missile won't even fire. But it's still playable.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">For AFOLs</span> : A rewarding build. Won't be mistaken for an 'ordinary' Lego model, people respect it and actually ask for permission to hold it for a closer look. If you like Cars, or cars, or perhaps work for a wrecker company, you'll appreciate the fine detailings that went into it. Looks great on the display shelf. As an AFOL, I'll give it <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(9.5/10).<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br></span><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
