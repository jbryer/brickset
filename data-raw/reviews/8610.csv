"POWERCARTOON_","2011-11-23T07:43:03.47Z","Fantastic set , not so keen on the price.","<p>This is a nice addition to the cars theme , especially the fact the cars are fantastic , but i'll get to that later , i will highlight the pros and cons quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Printed decals on the cars (No stickers on any of them)</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Tall and well made scructures </strong></p>
<p><strong>*Great starting (or finishing) line</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Plenty of&nbsp;playability</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Price a bit too high</strong></p>
<p><strong>*A lot of stickers for the flags ; pit stations ,&nbsp;ect</strong></p>
<p><strong>*Empty buildings (No playability within the structure)</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the cons shouldn't worry you too much though because there is still so much to do , including great pit stations&nbsp;; plenty of cars and some nice tall buildings.</p>
<p>I personally found fun in building this set and using it afterwards was awesome&nbsp;and i think you will find that&nbsp;too!</p>
<p>If you have read other reviews before this , you should know that the cars are brilliant despite the fact there not minifigures , they have cool decals and pieces (Lightning McQueen is my&nbsp;top car toy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall , if you can get this cheap then get it , toys r us in Uk have them half price and ebay sellers should sell them nearly just as cheap.</p>
