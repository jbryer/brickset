The quality is much more better in my opinion. Gladiator's bronze looks like real chrome, prinrings are great, price (at last in the Czech Republic) is still reasonable. But where are Brickset pages for every minifigure?",FALSE,5,5,4,4,5
"Cimi","2011-09-07T16:39:49.22Z","Price Increase","The minifigures are as always a nice addition for my large Lego City (~ 400 sets). According to brickset the USD and GBP price for this series of minifigures is the same as before. Unfortunately, the Euro price is now 2,49 (instead 1,99 for&nbsp;series 1-4).&nbsp;Quite expensive, if you want to buy several&nbsp;minifigures (e.g. you need at least two boxers or guards).&nbsp;It looks like there is also an EURO-crisis in Legoland. Hopefully, the price will decrease for the next series.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,3
