"TheFadedTBCap","2011-02-26T14:06:17.25Z","Best Video Game Ever!","<p>This game is amazing!&nbsp; It goes over all the four movies and fixed some of the old game's problems.&nbsp;manu takes&nbsp;place&nbsp;in a warehouse with&nbsp;lots of boxes.&nbsp; Six of these boxes lead to to worlds one for each movie (the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is split into three parts), and the other two are million stud worlds (were you try to collect a million studs) and the creator box.&nbsp; In the creator box you can build you own levels and minifigures and save them to use later.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;also build your own adventure by mixing in different levels and use quick play to get to a level fast.&nbsp; All the movie worlds consist of a certain pattern of levels which are adventure, fighting the enemies, car crash, collecting certain items, and the big battle at the end.&nbsp; Sadly, it cuts out some of the good parts of the movies and they added some new problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>New split screen</p>
<p>Creating levels and characters</p>
<p>Fighting enemies is harder </p>
<p>Cool new characters</p>
<p>New races to win vehicles and characters</p>
<p>Cool new levels</p>
<p>Better fighting moves</p>
<p>Weapon aiming</p>
<p>Better ways to find treasures (in mini&nbsp;levels instead of in the big levels)</p>
<p>Cool worlds to explore</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Whip tie (gives any body with a whip to much power and deletes whip moves)</p>
<p>When a charater (like enemy boxer) throws people it doesn't kill them</p>
<p>Overall, this game is awesome!&nbsp; I give it a 10/10 and I think you should get it</p>
