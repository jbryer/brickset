"MCLegoboy","2011-01-11T19:18:10.24Z","Overlookable Proportion Problems","<p>I recently got this as my final <em>Brickmaster</em> (Subscripton ended in January.)&nbsp;and I think everything is great, except that it's a little fat.&nbsp; The wings are too big to me.&nbsp; I get that it is a mini model and&nbsp;LEGO does with what&nbsp;it's got for small sets, it just seemed a little out of proportion.&nbsp; I can overlook it enough though&nbsp;to give&nbsp;the set&nbsp;a five out of five, a great ending to my <em>Brickmaster</em> subscription as it is <em>Star Wars</em> and the fact that mini models are so much fun to play with.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ShilohCyan","2021-12-17T20:59:19.987Z","Better than it should be","<p>Recently got into mini SW ships and parted out a dozen or two from Bricklink. This is the version of Slave I I chose. I realise not many people will even read this so long after its relevance but I can&#39;t contain my joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of the dozens of minis I&#39;ve built this is by far my favorite and I&#39;m not even a Boba Fett fanboy.&nbsp;The shaping is so satisfying and the wings tilt with gravity better than the 2021 minifig scale set does. The colors&nbsp;are mouthwatering&nbsp;despite the lack of sand green but maybe those details didn&#39;t scale well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My single complaint is the use of 1x2x1&nbsp;and adjacent 1x1x.66 slopes on the bottom section, when corner slopes that exist could&#39;ve rounded out those contours a lot better, but if this was the only set that year they&#39;d make that part in metrum red for, I guess it can be forgiven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Love this little thing. Makes a grown man wanna swoosh it around.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Design is absolutely fantastic</li><li>Wings rotate like other Slave I set</li><li>Good use of wheel plate</li><li>Rare colored pieces</li><li>The price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>NONE!</li></ul>
<p>Thank you for reading this review!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Great size for a polybag.</p>

<p>-Nice selection of parts.</p>

<p>-The wings move when you tilt the ship.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Binocular pieces fall off when you move the cannons.</p>

<p>-No stand.</p>

<p>-I wish the cockpit was trans-brown</p>
