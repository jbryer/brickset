"legogal","2013-07-24T09:49:47.607Z","What a coooooool clown fish!","<p>WOW! What a neat polybag fish! I landed ""Fishy"" last weekon eBay and then Bricklink, and want to share a few ideas about it. So this is not an official review....just some random thoughts.</p><p>The polybag contains clear instructions, which are a real plus. This makes the build simple; many five year olds could put this together correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>And the design is just stunning, especially if you are into beautiful tropical fish. I love snorkeling with them in warm water, so Fishy brings back lots of great memories from exotic locales.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a hard to find polybag these days, but you can get it on Bricklink at $5US or eBay (if you want to pay much more.) Has anyone seen it in a bricks and mortar store recently? It was given out as a freebie in Europe and sold at some Parks; later it showed up at Five Below, a discounter in the US. But that was over a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>This is one cute little fishy! Can't wait to put it in our aquarium! Does anyone know if aquarium lights will fade the little guy?</p><p>If you need a nice gift for someone who enjoys fish, this could be perfect! Fingers are crossed that LEGO will do more colorful fish in polybags because this is a real winner.</p><p>Has anyone built this in other colors? Finding pastel colored parts must have been a bear, but should be worth it. Has anyone seen any other fish this size? Fishy needs as friend or two...</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,2,5
