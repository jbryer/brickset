<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a standard polybag. Nothing too fancy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a fairly basic selection of parts, but many of them are in tan for the first time, I believe.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the set takes around 2-3 minutes. Nothing too complicated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks good, but it doesn&#39;t scale with the polybag MTT. The turret does swivel, however.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I would only get this if you are a MOCer. No one really likes The Phantom Menace anyways.</p>
