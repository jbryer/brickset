"LStyer","2011-11-23T15:21:47.7Z","Fun Build, Good Model","<p>I picked up set 30053, Republic Attack Cruiser in a polybag for $4 at Target.&nbsp; It differs from most of the polybag impulse sets I've seen in the checkout line at Target in that it's a micro-scale model and contains no minifigs, but it was a fun build and it is one of the most ""on-model"" micro-scale models I've ever seen.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set comes in a polybag with a single seven-step instruction sheet.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some neat parts here, notably some interestingly shaped light grey plates.&nbsp; I can imagine these might come in handy for Star Wars inspired MOCs.&nbsp; There are also a few maroon pieces that I've not seen elsewhere.&nbsp; A few light grey wedges are useful for rock formations.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None.&nbsp; This is just a micro-scale model.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This is a satisfying if quick build.&nbsp; It's hardly challenging, but you can really see the model come together</p><p> <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is really where it's at for this set.&nbsp; It's amazing how much this tiny little thing looks like a Venator Class ship.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a fun little set, and at $4 the price isn't bad at all, either for the finished model or just a few interesting parts.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,2,5
"Huge_Nerd","2011-12-11T05:54:08.483Z","A nice little impulse set.","I am always impressed by the Star Wars polybags and this one is no exception. These are currently found in the checkout lanes and holiday aisles at Target in the US. The set is made up of common pieces (with some in uncommon color, like the burgundy grates), but the final model is an excellent representation of the Venator class ship--the precursor to the Star Destroyer, if I'm not mistaken. This makes a great stocking stuffer!<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5
"AETerry","2012-02-06T14:20:04.353Z","Venator Class Republic Attack Cruiser Review","<p>I picked this up from a local Target for $4 from their check out lines. It's actually a decent and good impulse buy. I'm not completely familiar with the ship but grabbed it up with an eye towards pieces and parts.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set comes in a polybag with a folded set of instructions with easy to follow step-by-step illustrated instructions. Given the size of the set, it's very easy to follow and build.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 44 pieces with plenty of grey and burgundy pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are no minnifigures as this is a micro-scale build and model.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The ship is fairly straight forward and a simple build. Especially for micro-scale. You can tell what it's supposed to be and it looks a lot like the Star Destroyers from the classic or original trilogy of Star Wars movies. Especially if they're trying to create ship designs that were to predate Empire Era Ships and look older.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I've already stated, the build isn't bad and you can tell what it is. I'm not completely familiar with everything from Star Wars, so I'm not totally familiar with this ship. Still, it's a good ship and build and for an impulse buy, I'm not disappointed.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,3
"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T15:32:43.073Z","Another nice little impulse promo...","<p>I received this set a couple of days ago in my Christmas stocking, and it is a real home run. Though I don't like the overall Clone Wars, I really do like their ships, and this ship is based only by how awesome it really is.<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-It is easily recognizable as a precursor to the Empire's Star Destroyer naval fleet.<br></li><li>-The touch of maroon pieces are a nice and welcome addition to add detail to the ship. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-There are too few guns, which sort of matters as this was a large warship. <br></li><li>-The dark gray slotted cheese slope piece feels a bit out-of-place in this model. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>For 40 pieces, this set really packs a big punch in set design. However, it just doesn't have that giant warship feel that I would want. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Blockland","2014-02-05T02:51:05.72Z","Good little set","<p>The Venator Capital Ship is by far one of my personal favorite ships in the Star Wars universe. That being said, I had high hopes for this set once I bought it, and I was somewhat pleased.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag is still the annoying to touch plastic wrapping, with some added details, specifically Captain Rex on the top banner and I believe Aldeeran in the background. The instructions are a nice, folded, piece of paper that has no mistakes in the building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The array of parts added to the set is good, for making both mini-scaled ships, or even help make finishing details to a larger ship. The color scheme is movie accurate as far to my knowledge of watching episode 3 as a kid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Pfft, if a single minifigure was added, we all know Lego would raise the price by 5 dollars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build&nbsp;was a very nice 2 minute experience, with no mistakes in the instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a fair representation of the actual ship, though it is lacking both the side turbo laser turrets and side hangars. However, the only major flaw is the bridge, which is too small to be even considered a bridge. A binocular piece was probably not the best decision for a bridge, which lead to me customizing it so it had a somewhat bigger and more detailed bridge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very nice set for both the piece count, actual model, and price. While there may not be much playability or &quot;swoosh&quot; to the actual model, it still gives a fair representation, for the price and pieces. While I think Lego could have done a much better job, for a low cost, it is worth a pick up if you so desire. Now, when is Lego going to give us its counterpart, the Providence cruiser?</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-01-12T18:08:40.837Z","The best micro scale model","<p>This is one of the many ships from the clone wars that is made into a micro scale model.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This set comes as a poly bag. The instructions involve many pieces added at each step, so it can be a little complicated.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts are mostly grey with a few reds. The best piece is the handheld binoculars.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>Takes 5 minutes to build at most. Uses the engines well and the binoculars make for amazing twin bridges.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>There are no flaws in this design and is one of a kind. Buying is compulsory.</p>
