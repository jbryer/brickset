In case you are unsure of what this set consists of, or where it is available, I shall explain.</p><p>You can find this set in any Lego store (I got mine in Brighton) and it costs Â£9.99, not a bad price considering what you get. In the pack, which is much like the character and spinner sets, you get a Sensei Wu&nbsp;Minifigure, two exclusive cards and nine advanced weapons.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packaging is very similar to that of the spinner and figure packs. Sensei Wu is built in the pack and is holding his trademark wooden staff. The cards are on display as well. The nine weapons are disassembled in a small bag.</p><p>There are no instructions included, not even a little leaflet! But the weapons are easy to build using just the pictures of them on the packaging. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are excellent, with many exclusive or rare pieces included. We get not just one, but two black lightsaber hilts, a short chain, a glow in the dark 'ivy' piece, two pieces of green and blue lightning, three Asajj Ventress Lightsaber hilts, two chainsaws, a large dagger piece and two black Katanas! Absolutely sublime! The parts are what make this set just spectacular, I can barely explain how good they are! There is no spinner included in this set sadly, but we can get Sensei Wu's spinner in the Spinjitsu Dojo or presumably his spinner and character pack, which will be appearing later this year.</p><p>The weapons included are a flaming torch, a whip, a very long spear, a double ended Katana, a double ended chainsaw, two pieces of lightning, a red flag on a pole (I don't quite see how that is a weapon) some grey&nbsp;nun-chucks and a huge hammer with a wooden handle and a large grey head. All very nice.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The Sensei Wu figure is probably one of the best from the Ninjago line. I love the hat, the detail is wonderful. The head is also very nice, showing a determined expression and a beard, there are even wrinkles! The new white beard is good, better than the older normal beard. His torso is quite detailed with a neckline and buttons, a small flowery motif on his right shoulder and a larger motif on the back. The legs have some printing, a belt with two black&nbsp;tassels&nbsp;hanging from it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this set is great, the figure is good, the weapons are spectacular, and the cards (a gold card and a 3D Sensei Wu character card) are pretty decent too.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"TopperTwist","2011-03-12T21:16:16.353Z","It's Cool to Have, but Way Overpriced","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Owning this set is great. The pecies are amazing, they speak for themeselves. Getting Sensei Wu in a $15 dollar set, magnificent! But is $15 worth a few pecies, a Chinese plastic minifig, and TWO cards? Find out. Review in short: Unless you need a Sensei Wu minifig, I wouldn't suggest wasting your money on this. </p>
<h4>Minifig/Accessories:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Sensei Wu is very nice. He comes with his 2011 straw hat, his usual face, a 2011 beard peice, a printed torso, printed legs, and a standard staff. He's one of the more rare NinjaGo minifigs, so it's good to see him in a cheaper set, however he is really bad Chinese plastic. The accessories have great pecies, they are the following: nunchucks, a whip, two bricks, a double-bladed saw, a spear, a double-bladed sword, a flag (what a weapon), two rare lightining bolt things, a torch, and&nbsp;a hammer. Good selection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The cards included in this set are nice enough. The 3D Sensei Wu card would be cooler if it was actually 3D and didn't just give me (a TFOL) a headache every time I glanced at it. I'd rather have a standard Sensei card. The other card is a golded force-field card. Whoopty doo, a card that comes in the Spinjitzu starter set in 'Gold'.&nbsp;Those are all the cards you get, unfortunately. I really wish there would have been a spinner in this set. </p>
<h4>The Good:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The things I like about this set are: the inclusion of Sensei in a cheaper set, the packaging size (small), the lightning bolts, the glow-in-the-dark whip, and some of the other weapons. </p>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I don't like the cards, some of the weapons, the price, and this set not including a spinner.</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set needs a spinner. Anyways, this is one of those sets where you really want to own, but is nothing special at all. It feels cool to have, considering I THINK you can only get this at Lego stores (or through online sellers). Honestly, unless you want the minifig, or to have this in your possession, I would not reccommend paying $15 for it. If you do get it, keep it sealed because once you get over the whole ""Woohoo I got it!"" phase, you could probably sell it for a lot of money. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2
