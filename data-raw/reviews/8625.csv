You paid 30p for the newspaper then you go to your local WHsmiths or TOYRUS and get your lego. Its a nice little set.<br><br>The build is simple, the colour scheme is blue and white and has some black and grey pieces. A nice piece you get with the set is a 1x2 clear brick and you get two of them. Theres not much to review, it looks like a truck which is good ands it free.<br>The packaging is a polybag with the lego creator logo on it. <br><br>Overall the set is nice and its free.<br>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,4
