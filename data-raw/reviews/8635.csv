This is a very nifty little set, glad to have it. Not too complicated but the end result is pretty good.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Box/Instructions</span></p><p>The ""box"" isn't even a box- it's plastic packaging. However it does show what's inside and labels it under the CREATOR brand. The instructions comprise of one piece of paper which you unfold. It works pretty well, but it is a tad plain... but it is a Wreath, not much you can do.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Slopes, connecting bricks, domes, studs- you have a nice share of bricks here. The slopes are nice, especially for houses and buildings, so slopes are fine in my book! Left over is a red stud and a black claw piece. Nice pieces you can never have too many of.</p>
<h4>Function</h4><p>Now there's something worth noting: this is just a Wreath. It's not a wreath race car or anything, so not much playability there, but it does function well as a decoration on a town building, or in my case, a Christmas tree ornament! Overall it works pretty well.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is rather simple, not difficult and easy for anyone to understand. Firstly, you build two yellow bells, then green connecting pieces to form a circle. In reality, you only build two things, repeating it a couple of a times. It's not a very entertaining build much, but since it takes about a minute to build, it's not bad.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed wreath looks really great. I would be proud to display this great model in my room! Looks very similar to a wreath too!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall, a great little set. Not complicated but it looks nice and gets the job done. Works great as a stocking stuffer! If you have money around, do yourself a favor and buy this set!</div>",TRUE,4,4,2,1,5
"AETerry","2011-12-11T14:39:44.843Z","Holiday Wreath Review","Yeah, I saw this at Wal-Mart yesterday and on impulse, just had to pick it up. Value wise for that at $3.49 there-abouts, it's fairly good. I already opened this up and put it together as I've already gotten other Holiday Polybags for stocking stuffers from LEGO this year.<br><br>It is labeled as a Creator, which to me means it will be a model set put somewhere for display and decoration. It fits perfectly so with several other LEGO Christmas themed sets I've got and have made.<br><br>With the small polybags, you'll get a small, oftentimes simple build. Yet as this one proves along with a few others I've gotten, you get an excellent build and value for the price.<br><br>Given the nature of the bells on the bottom, it needs to hang somewhere and if its anything at all like the Snowman Creator set of this size, it will do perfectly as a tree ornament, just get some string or not and hang it on a branch.<br><br>For those inclined, there are plenty of pieces to work with for other ideas and MOCs. Me personally, I'll be packing this away at the end of the year with other Christmas LEGO sets to come out for next year.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,2,5

This set is a great little stocking stuffer, and has a certain completeness to it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The genius who crafted the two bells needs to be thanked dearly.<br></li><li>-Throughout the model, the whole wreath feels very familiar, sort of like a buildable Christmas ornament.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The model is very hard to stand up thanks to the bells, and has quite a repetitive build.<br></li><li>-The red little berries are also very randomly placed, which could have been fixed with the 1x2 plate with the stud in the middle on the green parts of the wreath.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is an exceptional Christmas set, one which I think is a bit underestimated by reviewers. This is good as a display, mainly as a Christmas tree ornament. I recommend this to all who celebrate Christmas.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

Even if they are green and yellow, MOCs can use them still. it will go up very well with my holiday display in my house for my kids.<br>",TRUE,3,5,4,2,4
