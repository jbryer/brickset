"Pugsly","2011-04-03T17:19:02.767Z","Excellent train with superb parts","<p>This train is a must have for train builders. &nbsp;The Maersk blue colors and the techniques used to build to build are incredible. &nbsp;The build is done in about 5 different sections with 2 booklets. &nbsp;The Engine is booklet 1 and the containers, freight cars and ""tug"" are all in booklet 2.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>&nbsp;Maersk Blue....need i saw more?</li><li>&nbsp;The engine is very detailed</li><li>&nbsp;Nice design on the engine bogies</li><li>&nbsp;Nice fuel tank design</li><li>&nbsp;Containers are nice and big</li><li>&nbsp;Maersk Blue &nbsp;:)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>&nbsp;Price is about $20 too much, would like to see a $99 price point</li><li>&nbsp;Only 2 container cars, would like at least 3</li><li>&nbsp;No way to add lights to the engine like you can on the Santa Fe or EN</li></ul>
<p>For those of you that think this is a redo of the BNSF engine from a few years ago, this is NOT. &nbsp;For one thing, it is about 1/3 bigger than the BNSF. &nbsp;There are about 5 parts total that are the same in both models. &nbsp;The Maersk train is a lot more detailed with a lot more advanced build. &nbsp;This will be a staple model in almost every train LUG layout you will see from now on. &nbsp;I just can't wait to see the varieties people come up with from this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"stagus","2011-04-10T03:22:42.743Z","Excellent Train . Interesting build.","<p>My first Maersk piece and I love the Maersk blue already.&nbsp; The build is fun and challenging.&nbsp; There is a cracking diesel engine housed in the rear of the main engine, although you would remove this to add power functions....not sure what I am going to do yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downside of the build the number of stickers.&nbsp; THere are loads including 4 really small ones that go on 1 square angled bricks on either end of the engine.&nbsp; Prepare to have patience!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the price is well set.&nbsp; £92 is not cheap but by not adding track or power it keeps the price down and this is a set that will increase in value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maerk Blue bricks 
<li>Fabulous level of detail on the engine 
<li>Cool Tug 
<li>Excellent collectors set 
<li>Not a bad price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>A lot of stickers (48) 
<li>If you power it up you lose some fabulous internal detail 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Worthy addition to any collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

<ul><li>Large set with a good variety of parts!</li><li>Maersk Blue in a good variety of useful parts!<br></li><li>Good playability with the train, truck, several containers and three figs.<br></li><li>Detailed and realistic construction.</li><li>Solid, durable build.</li><li>Very attractive when complete.</li><li>The inclusion of 8 of the new-ish PF medium train wheels, rather than the stock assembly used on the cars.</li><li>Unique, nice figures.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A bit high on price ($120 in US)<br></li><li>For this price I would have liked to see another car with container.&nbsp; (Odd numbers of cars always look better to me)<br></li><li>I always feel a bit slighted when I have to go and purchase more Power Functions elements to motorize a set.</li><li>Too many stickers.&nbsp; I would much rather have the large stickers be printed elements!</li><li>- And on that note the white stickers on my sheet were not punched through, and one ended up tearing trying to peal it off.&nbsp; I have yet to contact TLG about this.<br></li></ul>
<p>All-in-all, this set is an decent value for the money.&nbsp; I understand that certain elements such as the magnetic couplers/buffer beams and the standard train wheel assembly are more costly to produce, but I would have loved a third car in the set to balance out the look of the train.&nbsp; But still the set is inside that golden pricing zone of around $0.10/piece and it is a real treat to build.</p><p>My wife even enjoys having it around, as she loves the color and is happy to support my new LEGO theme!</p><p>I would not let this set slip by, and it is still very much worth the standard price.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Dodge","2011-04-13T10:53:52.987Z","Do not let this train pass you by!","<p>This was a great set to build!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detail and amount of pieces you receive to make this set are well worth the time it takes to put it together.&nbsp; It took around 3 hours (with a small root beer break in the middle) to create this wonderful train.&nbsp; The colours (Maersk blue!) are great and create a super design for the locomotive.&nbsp; I was only a little disappointed that stickers were used to create some of the design rather than figuring it out in bricks, but the finished look is what matters in the end.</p>
<p>The sticker set for this is HUGE, some of the largest stickers I've ever used!&nbsp; Great additions to each piece of the set and give it a realism that only helps to add to this already great set!</p>
<p>Yes the price is fairly hefty in some places ($154.99 for us in Canada) but on the whole I am glad that I spent the cash (and VIP points!) to get this set.&nbsp; It is a GREAT addition to any collection!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"matrix_7000","2011-04-14T10:56:44.573Z","The best train set ever","<p>This is the best looking and detailed train set from Lego. It looks really good and drive well on lego train track. A complete set, the engine and two double stak cars and as a bonus a nice container truck and 3 specila minifigs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just amazing, go for it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"redgreenblue","2011-05-11T16:21:36.033Z","Interesting build, unusual and realistic model","<p>This is an excellent build.</p><br><p>There's a wide range of parts, many different sections to the build and not too much repitition.&nbsp; With this model Lego trains continue going from strength to strength.&nbsp; Emerald Night was excellent, and this is a worthy replacement in the Lego catalogue.&nbsp; What's really great is that this is not another steam train - it's great to be able to get a well designed modern diesel on display.</p><br><p>The three included minifigs are basically all the same, with the same accessories but different faces, and nothing to write home about.</p><br><p>You have to buy power functions sets (plural!) and track if you want your train to move and this can prove to be expensive.&nbsp; If you are planning this consider getting any of the standard trains (eg <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7938-1"">7938</a> or <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7939-1"">7939</a>) when they are on offer to get much of what you need.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing I really do like about 10219 is the inclusion of the articulated tractor unit for shifting containers around the docks.&nbsp; This is an unusual design, but very realistic, and I can just picture the real thing driving around blowing black smoke out of it's exhaust.&nbsp; It really adds some value to the set considering the price.</p><p><br></p><p>I've marked it down slightly for the excessive use of stickers where building techniques could've been used (the diagonal stripe on the side of the cab) and because a lot of the stickers cover more than one brick.&nbsp; Also at £91 it's a touch too expensive in the UK (and elsewhere apparently).&nbsp; But this is the way Lego exclusive sets are going.<br></p><br><p>Unfortunately Lego seems to be having some problems with maintaining colour across different parts, especially with the unusual colours like Maersk blue.&nbsp; The tiles I recieved are a slightly different hue to the bricks, which I can live with, but there is a marked difference in an <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2357"">inverted slope</a> and one of the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2357"">corner bricks</a> (of 3).</p><br><p>To sum up, this is an excellent build.&nbsp; There's a good range of parts with some interesting building methods 
used, along with a good deal of Maersk blue 
pieces (including hard hats) and when you want to take it apart and make
 a different train you shouldn't have any trouble with all the included 
train wheels and bogies to start you off.</p><br>A defininte ""Buy""!<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Bumblepants","2012-08-04T11:42:16.407Z","Beautiful Diesel Train","<p>I bought this set to replace the HO model train table I had recently sold and I am very pleased with it. Diesel trains have always captured my imagination and to get such great Lego model really excited me.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1- The locomotive is just beautifully modeled and a very fun build.<br></li><li>Pro 2- The Maersk blue bricks are a fantastic color and there are many of them in quite a variety of shapes.<br></li><li>Pro 3- The asymmetrical truck cab is really unique and makes a great addition to the train and gives more playability to the set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1- Stickers of course, I do not mind that they are included but the ones which cross multiple parts are frustrating, in particular, the ones on the front and back of the locomotive. It is also worth noting that the Maersk star logos are a bit tricky to make sure they are placed upright.<br></li><li>Con 2- The containers are quite repetitive to build, especially the two gray ones with the high number of 1x2 light bley bricks.</li><li>Con 3- The cost to motorize is a good bit extra.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, a great train set that comes with a challenging and fun build and looks great when finished. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"xboxtravis7992","2013-03-02T17:12:46.04Z","American Train, Danish Shipping Company, and Everybody's Favorite Building Toy","<p>Out of the three Lego exclusive trains, the Maersk Train is simply my favorite. It manages to capture the feel of American freight railroading in ABS plastic.</p><p><b>Parts</b></p><p>Maersk blue bricks, enough said.</p><p><b>Minifigures</b></p><p>While not especially outstanding the trio of rail workers captures the look of American rail yard workers.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The diesel is a superb build, jamming plenty of detail onto a 6-stud wide frame. The model captures the look of the venerable GP series of locomatives, and the SNOT methods used to achieve this are fun and interesting. The way the 6-stud wide containers where integrated with the train is simple, yet spectacular and an obvious improvement over previous Lego container trains. The only weak spot is the extensive use of STAMPS, nesscary though to achieve the proper decal work seen on the model.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The Maersk Train is an excellent looking model. Put side to side with my HO model of a similar locomotive it is clear the Maersk engine is a great rendition of a GP series locomotive.&nbsp;When compared to pictures of the actual Maersk locomotive, the only detail missing is the <i>Norfolk Southern</i>&nbsp;branding which was on the real engine. Other than that this model conveys everything about the train perfectly into Lego form. The addition of the yard truck and the freight cars completes the model.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Maersk Train is the best Lego depiction of American railroading since the BNSF loco. Arguably it is the best depiction of American Railroading Lego has ever made.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

<p>Box/Instructions<br />
Very well boxed&nbsp; and Great instruction booklets, Well laid out!</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>All of the&nbsp;Maersk&nbsp;blue is almost worth the price of admission(at retail price) alone! Nicely packaged too!</p>

<p>I am not a fan of stickers though! I almost wish for model car style waterslide decals! I feel they are more forgiving!</p>

<p>Nice job , just using the standard train guys. I love the&nbsp;Maersk&nbsp;blue hard hat!</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>I built the set over several evenings at a leisurely pace. All of the build was a pleasure!</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>I love the look of the completed train and truck!</p>

<p>I would love to have a container inter modal&nbsp; yard set to go with this&nbsp; set. It could contain&nbsp; a additional road tractor and more containers!</p>

<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, if you can find one!</p>

"FlagsNZ","2015-10-12T03:22:45.22Z","An extremely accurate diesel cargo train","<p>I have just had a wonderful weekend where my seven year old nephew was visiting from Australia. This gave me the opportunity, or excuse, to build up all my LEGO trains and lay out all my track.</p>

<p>This is the first review in a series of all the LEGO trains that I currently possess.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5762/21463899844_7552a10620_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has images of the set showing the features of the engine, carriages, cargo and truck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions come in two books and there is a sticker sheet with cardboard protection.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As this is a Maersk set, there are quite a few parts in <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/colour-Pastblu"">Pastblu</a>&nbsp;that are either unique to this set or found in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10152-1/Maersk-Sealand-Container-Ship"">10152&nbsp;Maersk Sealand Container Ship</a> or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10155-1/Maersk-Line-Container-Ship"">10155 Maersk Container Ship</a>.</p>

<p>The set is not motorised and comes with a brick built diesel motor, Technic bogie and a dummy IR Receiver. These&nbsp;can all be removed which allows for an <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88000-1/AAA-Battery-Box"">AAA Battery Box</a>, &nbsp;a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88002-1/Train-Motor"">Train Motor</a> and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8884-1/IR-Receiver"">IR Receiver</a>.</p>

<p>The diesel motor can be used as cargo on another flat car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/770/21899828389_821aa727d5_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three minifigures&nbsp;in this set all wearing <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6023553"">dark blue boiler suits</a>, &nbsp;high visibility vests and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4616409"">Maersk blue hard hats</a>. The hard hat and boiler suit are unique to this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/680/21898544270_6f633f8ba1_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a really ingenious build and a collector&#39;s item. While there is some duplication in building two flat cars and three containers, the results are worth it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The train is extremely detailed and one of the best LEGO&nbsp;diesel engines. It very accurately resembles the <a href=""http://willie.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=1176282"">real engine</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5786/21898851688_cee35a1683_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Also included with this set are two flat cars that can each hold either a twenty foot container or, using a removable block, two such containers provided that the container doors are at each end.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5633/21899827569_9445b4b5a8_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are three twenty foot containers in this set; two general boxes in medium stone grey and one reefer container in white. At one end of the reefer container is an accurate <a href=""http://rsgu.eu/en/containers/reefer-containers/"">motor compressor unit</a> with Partlow recording cards.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21899827939_fb30522db1_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The third container is transported on a road trailer which is towed around by a <a href=""http://www.northlincstyreslimited.co.uk/commercialEarthmover.html"">tugmaster wharf tractor</a>. This model captures the essence of these <a href=""http://burkeshipping.com/stevedoring/roro/"">powerful 4WD tractors</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5715/21899829009_c04c51e4be_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The road trailer can be disconnected from the tugmaster&nbsp;and it can lower the legs to stop the trailer from tipping.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/22086748945_8367b52ce4_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The LEGO Creator trains do not come motorised or with tracks. While this set could be a display piece, it is conceivable that most people would want to run this on tracks.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hiskidsbricks.co.nz/LEGO-Trains?product_id=241"">Train Power Functions accessory packs</a> can be purchased and is easily installed. This adds to the real&nbsp;cost of this set.</p>

<p>The low flat cars are quite close to the tracks and ran aground at the crest of my viaduct.</p>

<p>This engine could be replicated in other colours in the livery of other train companies.</p>

<p>The whole set is an accurate mix of cargo handling equipment with lots of play potential.</p>

<p>While it was released in 2011, there are some sets still available and reasonably priced.</p>
