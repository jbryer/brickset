"Legolijntje","2012-04-09T06:56:57.467Z","A very good replacement for the 8878","<p>I bought this set because many Technic MOC instructions use the 8878 and I wanted to buil them, but I didn't wanted to spend â‚¬50 on an battery box, so I bought this one. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It is lighter than a normal AA battery box</li><li>It's easier to use in model-team/creator/city MOCs</li><li>I'ts a bit smaller than the normal AA battery box.</li><li>The buttons to turn on and off and to switch direction are much easier to use than the normal AA battery box.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It hasn't a speed switch like on the 8878</li><li>You have to use a very small screwdriver to open the battery box and change the batteries</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, this is a very good value for your money. You can use it easier in most MOCs and it's a good replacement for the 8878.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't know if you want to buy this one or the 8878, here's a tip:</p><p>If you know you're going to use it very much, it's maybe better to buy the 8878. Before you know it, you spend more on the batteries than you did for a 8878...</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,2,4
