"Krataka15792","2011-09-03T20:00:31.637Z","Jay's Invention Finally Comes To Fruition...With Zane","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is Krataka15792, a.k.a. Zok: Insane Math Wizard on BZPower, coming at you with a new review. I recently bought the Hero Factory set Raw-Jaw recently, and since I had some money left over, I thought I would get an impluse set. I have always liked Ninja in white, since they resembled a traditional Gi, and I have always liked Zane. However, I always had the Zane from his Ice Dragon set, Zane DX, and I wanted a Zane in his starter uniform. The Ninja Glider set seemed right up my alley. Unlike my ususal sort of review, this will be short and sweet in a pros/cons list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going further into the review, keep in mind that in the Ninjago Storyline, Jay was actually the one who invented these gliders. However, he could nt be included since he already had his own impulse set to work with. This set itself is basically what you might think an impulse set like this may be, but there is more than meets the eye. Zane is the main attraction to the set, seeing as though this Zane is thecheapest you can get him at a price of only $3.99. His accessories are a ninja turbin and a black katana blade. The build for this set is nothing special, really, but its parts are actually quite useful. The Ninja Glider comes with six Exo-Force arms used for the miner bots, two Star Wars droid torsos, and six golden Lego Castle troll swords that make up part of the wings. One thing you should know is that the golden troll sword is used for Skeleton troops, especially Chopov, so if you have some skeleton troops, this will surely fill you up. The rest of the bricks are nothing special, and can be found in many sets nowadays. The completed model, in my honest opinion, is nothing special. The wings have to be constantly put back into a certain position during play, and Zane doesn't look good when connected to it. The Glider is connected by the legs via a special brick, and thats just about it. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Zane in standard Gi</li><li>Black Katana</li><li>SIX GOLDEN SWORDS</li><li>Gold Exo-arm pieces</li><li>Reasonable price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Build is lackluster</li><li>Design is impressive but weird</li><li>Minifigure does not look good positioned in it.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I think you should buy this set just for Zane and the six golden troll&nbsp;swords that come with it. This is the cheapest set to get Zane in without spending $10 on a game with a chinese plastic&nbsp;sub-par minifig. Its not bad, I just think its more of an arsenal set, like the Ninja Training Outpost with Cole.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3

"BobaFett2","2011-09-27T13:13:13.973Z","You get some cool parts - one of the better Polybagged sets","<p>While leaving Target one day this set caught my eye, and since my brother really wanted it I got it for him.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a small polybag, with a nice little logo. It shows him flying above the treeline with really tall mountains in the background.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>6 gold robot arms, 6 gold swords. That alone is pretty sweet. The other parts are pretty nice, although they aren't many of them.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get one Zane minifigure. He's identical to other Ninjago Ninjas except that he has a different color and a different face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There's not much build to speak of, due to the small size of the set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is cool, but there are a few oddities. The first is that he cannot attach both hands to the glider at once. Instead, his feet can be attached, but not at the same time as the hands. The wings, of course, are unrealistic, as it's impossible to fly with heavy metal wings.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's a good set for parts, and a nice little impulse buy. It can be fun to play with for a while and the parts can be added to other sets as well. I recommend this set to Ninjago fans and anyone who has a few bucks to spare.<br></p>",TRUE,3,5,2,3,3

"xccj","2011-10-06T18:48:27.317Z","This Set is InZane!","<p>Sorry, I mean Zane is in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose this set is a promotional polybag set that you can pick up at various retail stores, but I bought mine from a vendor at BrickCon, so I can't really say how easy it is to find.&nbsp; Overall, it's a neat little set for the Ninjago theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, this set contains Zane, the white ice ninja.&nbsp; Best of all, Zane comes in his standard ninja outfit, which is only availible in some of the more expensive Ninjago sets.&nbsp; (Zane does appear in the cheaper Ice Dragon set, but that's his dragon outfit, so it's not quite the same.)&nbsp; Overall, he has some decent printing on his torso and legs and the standard Ninja headgear, plus a standard black katana.&nbsp; But the best part is that you can get him in this cheaper polybag as opposed to the larger sets, so that's one way you can build up your Ninjago minifig collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main build here is the glider, which is not quite as exciting as Zane.&nbsp; It comes with some nice pieces, namely 6 gold Exo Force robot arms and 6 gold swords.&nbsp; They're built in a way to make them extend out as wings.&nbsp; While it's a creative idea, it's not very stable, and I had trouble readjusting my wings to look good.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's no ideal way to attach Zane to the wings.&nbsp; He can grab onto the handle with one hand, or you can attach his legs to the SNOT (studs not on top) brick, but these methods still make the wings look all the more awkward.&nbsp; I'm not sure if there'd be a decent way to fix this, but I must say that something needs to be done to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this set is not about the build, because the golden glider just doesn't look right.&nbsp; But it does have the pieces (gold swords and robot arms) and minifig to make it worth buying.&nbsp; If you're into the Ninjago theme and happen to find the set in stores, I would certainly recomend picking it up and adding the pieces to your collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"fikko3107","2012-12-11T12:47:04.387Z","a great set and a good parts pack","<p>If you see the notes, you'd probably be thinking that the only way to get this set is from ""The Sun"" newspaper or at a Walmart promotion. I am here to tell you that there are other ways to get this set. Personally, I got it as part of a local promotion in my town by an almost-unknown pen company known as ""Papermate"" Starting around last year, they have been packaging their pens with LEGO polybags, so this is a chance for Indonesians to grab sets that could soon be rare. For a full list of sets that I've seen Papermate package with their pens, go to http://www.brickset.com/brickLists/?8031<br>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>This set is packaged in a polybag, with a box art (or should I say polybag art) of the set suspended in midair with a hazy background of a mountainous region. The LEGO Ninjago logo covers most of the top of the polybag. On the other side of the polybag is a 1:1 scale of the black katana, since a full body minifigure 1:1 would be too space consuming. it also has warnings of choking hazards in at least a dozen languages. The polybag instructions are in the same styles as traditional polybags, namely folded 4 times. the ""Cover"" uses the same art as the polybag. On the other side, lots of unused space is used to advertise most of the mainstream sets of the first wave of 2011. Spinners are excluded, except for the starter set.
<h4>Parts</h4><p>there are a few interesting parts that come with this set.. You get not one, not two but six golden machetes/troll scimitars/dark blades and Devastator arms, which have also appeared with the Meca-one minifigure from the exo-force theme. You also get a round, 2x2 tile in red, used solely for decoration. There is also the ever so useful 1x2 brick with studs on both of the sides. A couple of battle droids torsos are included, and athough it may seem boring, these pieces are quite innovatively used. also included is a 1x2 plate with handles, a couple of lamp-holders,a 1x2 tan plate and a 1x2 black tile. including the minifig (and his sword) there are 26 pieces in this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>If you are a fan of the Ninjago TV series, this minifigure is instantly recognizable, namely Zane, the white ninja, in his classic outfit, which appears in 4 other 2011 sets besides this one. Zane has a medium-gray undershirt underneath his white gi, and had brown ropes running across him, gathering in his golden wolf-like insignia, which is the elemental symbol of Ice. Zane even has some creases printed, but his back is completely without printing. His legs simply finish the outfit, with a belt in the same color of the undershirt being printed on the hips and running to the upper legs. Zane uses a ninja head wrap, a piece introduced in the original ninja theme, used very rarely throughout the years (Dengar, CMF series 1 Ninja,etc.)and comes back with a bang in the Ninjago theme. this headwrap is white, just like Dengar's and the white ninja princess'. Zane brandishes a black katana with a square hilt, unlike the previously established octagon hilt that can be found in spinners and the original ninja theme. I have no idea why this difference exists, but personally I prefer the square hilt better.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>Building this set is fairly linear; first you stack the 1x2s, add the lamp holders, lock with a 1x2 tile, decorate with the round 2x2, add droid bodies (which is an innovative use for this) then the arms, then the scimitars, put Zane on and you're done. very simple build, yet still more engaging than 2010 city's ""Farmer""
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The end product really looks like a glider; much sleeker than those from 1999. Technically speaking, I can't see how you could fly a contraption made of heavy looking golden machetes, actually. the model surprisingly appears in the pilot episodes and was mentioned in Episode 11:""All of Nothing"". The model itself is very swooshable, but i have another complaint: without resting on anything, it can't stand. if you don't MOD it with bricks so it can stand nice and stable, you need to lean it against a wall...I did the latter.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Right, to conclude:</p><p>Box/instructions:6/10-A polybag with some nice artwork.</p><p>Parts:7/10-Some rare pieces are available, such as the golden machetes.</p><p>Minifigures:6/10-You get Zane. Plain old Zane. it's a good minifig to have, though.</p><p>The build:8/10-A surprisingly innovative build for such a small set.</p><p>The completed model:6/10-Very good, very sleek but&nbsp; it can't stand well on it's own.</p><p>so, that's a 6.6/10.
