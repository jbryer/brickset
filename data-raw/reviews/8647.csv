"LStyer","2011-03-26T17:41:05.65Z","Not a great model, but worth picking up for minifig and parts.","<p>I picked this polybag set up at Toys R Us last week.&nbsp; I don't care at all for the model -- the ""vehicle"" side of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ninjago</span> theme leaves me cold and the bones-as-helicopter-blades design of this vehicle strikes me as particularly silly.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good parts -- while I don't care for how the ""leg-bone"" pieces are used here, I'm happy to get ahold of four of them in an impulse set. <br></li><li>Again, while I don't like the finished model, it utilizes a few building techniques that I liked.&nbsp; In particular I hadn't run into bone pieces connected to clips as they are here to form helicopter blades.&nbsp; It immediately inspired me to try to create a prison door from bones.</li><li>The skeleton minifigure included is pretty cool.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I really don't like this model.&nbsp; As I already mentioned, the bone helicopter blades strike me as ridiculous, and the model overall looks bulky for what is basically a variation on a jetpack.&nbsp; I went ahead and built the model, and it wasn't a bad build experience, but I dinged playablity because even as a kid I'm pretty sure I would have hated the helicopter.<br></li><li>This is an ""across-the-theme"" complaint, but I don't dig the mix of feudal Japanese-inspired fantasy characters and architecture with modern-to-futuristic technology.</li><li>Another across-the-theme complaint -- I don't care for the skeleton's boots.&nbsp; I can see myself dropping this complaint into every review I write of a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ninjago</span> set that <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>includes a skeleton.&nbsp; It'll probably get old.<br></li></ul>
<p>Even though I dislike the model, I'm glad I grabbed this for the pieces and the minifig.&nbsp; In fact, I may pick up a couple more copies of this set for skeleton ""army building"" and to put together than bone prison I mentioned above.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,1,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard instructions and polybag is poor. 2/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Parts are decent although not fantastic. 2/5</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Frakjaw is the highlight of the set. Cheapest way to get hold of him! 3/5</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Build is poor. Building Experience is virtually nil, apart from a few bits which may be tricky for younger builders. 2/5</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Rather Poor, 3/5</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall not a fantastic set. Although ability to use the parts for MOC's is undeniable!</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,5
