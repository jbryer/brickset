"alva","2011-07-24T23:02:45.373Z","Great Polybag for Ninja Army Building","I think the review of this set will be the same as my review for 30080, the Ninja Glider.<br>This set is a great set if you want to build a ninja army, without have to buy any Ninjago sets. Cheap and fast.<br><br>If you got 6 golden swords from the 30080, here in the 30082, you will get 4 black samurai swords and one brown stick. Quite nice, so if you want to build an army, you can equip them with the weapons you got from this set.<br><br>The building of this set is just so so. What you can expect from an impulse anyway? But I really recommend you to get at least one of this set, if you want to collect some Ninjago minifigs cheaply. And for you army builder, this is the cheapest way to get some blue ninja minifigs!<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,1,2,5
"meyerc13","2011-12-06T09:56:50.44Z","Venomari Training","<p>I think this is the first of the 2012 Ninjago Venomari polybags.&nbsp; In this set we have the blue Ninja Jay armed with a staff, training against a white snake head with four spinning swords.&nbsp; The color of the snake's head is odd, but the fangs and the glowing red eyes are perfect.&nbsp; This is a nice little set, and a great way to introduce the Venomari to your kids', or your, Ninjago collection.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set is a typical polybag.&nbsp; Looking at the bag in the store, I wasn't sure what the set was supposed to be, but it became clear building the set.&nbsp; So overall I think the packaging in this case left something to be desired.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts aren't terribly exciting, to be honest.&nbsp; Some small polybags come with lots of pieces that could be useful, but I don't think that's the case here.&nbsp; It does come with four black swords, so that's nice.&nbsp; One odd choice to me was the piece for the snake's head, why did they choose white for the color?&nbsp; Green would have been better.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>This comes with the blue Ninja, Jay.&nbsp; For the price of the set, it's a good value to get the Ninja and some parts, since a normal collectible minifig is $3 just for the figure.<h4>The build</h4>The build isn't anything spectacular, you can probably figure it out without too much difficultly even without the instructions.&nbsp; But hey, it's a polybag, so what do you expect?<h4>The completed model</h4>Overall, I think the set works.&nbsp; The color choice is odd, but other than that I can't complain about the set.&nbsp; It's fun to spin the swords and have Jay dodge the blades as he tries to hit the snake in the head.<h4>Summary</h4><p>As the first Venomari playset to my knowledge, this is a fun little set that allows you to introduce your Ninjago Ninjas to fighting the snake people.&nbsp; Definitely a great stocking stuffer with the holidays approaching.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"AETerry","2011-12-22T14:46:58.443Z","Ninja Training Review","At about $3.49 for the Polybag, this isn't a bad little set. It makes for a great impulse buy and stocking stuffer for your LEGO Fan or yourself.<br><br>The minifigure included in the set is the blue ninja known as Jay, like Blue Jay, easy to remember. He comes with a brown stick or staff piece he fights with.<br><br>The build for the Training post starts off almost similiar to the Turret build from the Mandalorian Battle Pack set.<br><br>It's a bit surprising to a see a new or unique piece and that's the ""ring"" piece with the clasps holding the katanas as they spin around for Jay to practice blocking or hitting.<br><br>The final build/part of the set with the skull on top almost looks a bit snake like too with the fangs, so it's a bit hard to tell what LEGO intended for it.<br><br>In the end, it's an easy way to get Jay without paying $10 for one of the Spinner Sets he comes in or a much larger Ninjago set that didn't personally appeal to me. And it's a great way to get a lot of good extra pieces to incorporate into other builds and MOCs.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"NinjaGO_","2012-02-02T14:59:10.033Z","Finally!","After a while, I was able to find this set, and I think it is very good. First, this is the cheapest way to get Jay and an obstacle course. I really enjoyed this set because&nbsp;I've wanted a spinning sword thing forever! Also, you can make up a story that Jay created this and it went crazy or something.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>This set comes in a polybag with smaller than normal size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice parts in this set. You get four black ninja swords, a white 2x4 slope brick, and the two green plates for the base. The total piece count for the set is 32. Overall a decent piece haul for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jay:</strong></p>

<p>You get the original version of Jay. He has the blue ninja hood with the clip on the back where you can (in this case) put the brown staff. He has his normal head with a neutral expression and split in the middle of his right eyebrow. He has printing on the front side of his torso. On the front you have the blue ninja robes covered by brown rope converging from 5 different directions at a gold Lightning logo. He has printing on his legs of a blue cloth belt with the tied ends hanging down from the torso and onto the legs. He is armed with a brown staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice polybag from Ninjago. The skeleton training dummy looks really nice. The four black ninja swords spin in a circle and provides a nice play feature for the set. The top of the dummy can move 90 degrees to change the height of it. Jay is a nice figure to get and at the time a nice cheap way to get Jay. I highly recommend this set to any Ninjago fan/collector. This will also make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
