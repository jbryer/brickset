"Higgins","2011-03-12T23:44:55.973Z","Ninjao Dragon Fight Poly","<p>LEGO <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">#30083 Dragon Fight</span> Ninjago poly from Target at $3.49 USD. It is/was available in the seasonal section Easter 2011.</p><p>31 Pieces. The MF is the same that's in #2258 except this one has a black weapon. It may be in other sets too idk. Overall it's a fun build - as fun as 31 pieces can be that is! I liked that it was roughly 50 cents cheaper than other polybags at Target lately. The dragon's head is pretty cool. It reminds me of the birds in Medieval Market and other sets.</p><p><br></p><p>Thumbs up for sure!<br></p><p><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mostly bought it for the pieces and the fig. The dragon itself is good, but the head is retarted. also, where are the feet!? anyway, you should buy it if your a ninjago fan, but if not, its not worth it.</p>

The playability is 20/20,but there some ideas,like that the dragon is kai's pet,or that lord garmodden has brainwashed the dragon so kai must help it resist... but those are just my ideas,also,if your a minifig collector,this the cheapest way to get kai.",FALSE,5,3,3,4,4

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dragon looks like a Chicken 
<li>â€¦</li></ul>
<p>If you Want to get just the Ninjago minifigures this is the set for you.(I peorsonally dislike Ninjago)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for Reading</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
"NinjaGO_","2012-01-27T21:56:25.467Z","Yes or No?","I believe this set is&nbsp;OK, but&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;could've done better. First off, there is not much playability in this set. Secondly, there are not very many pieces and the head looks like a chicken! This set cost a bit too much for my overall expectations and the Kai that comes with it is oversized. My solution was to take the Ninjago Board Game Kai and put it on the dragon's head. And finally, I made some customizations to the dragon to make it look more like a dragon and less like a flying chicken.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,1,4

"Master_Wu","2019-10-22T02:54:44.773Z","Looks funny","<p>This was My first Ninjago set and I was a little disappointed with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure looks great but the dragon looks more like a butterfly. It&#39;s still a pretty decent&nbsp;set that&nbsp;was fun to build, and the price is still good, but I was a bit disappointed that the minifigure couldn&#39;t ride the dragon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the minifigure&nbsp;makes up for the disappointment in the dragon. I reccomend this set but would suggest maybe getting a different one if you want more play value.</p>
