"Mr__Mini_Man","2011-07-08T19:22:55.347Z","Fun lil' set","<p>Found this at TRU for $4.00 USD. I'd been looking all over town for weeks and finally found it!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>We get a small poly-bag. Nothing special.&nbsp; The instructions come&nbsp;on folded paper like the other poly-bages. Again, nothing special.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As said before, nothing special, with the exception of the minifig torsos.&nbsp; But for $4.00 USD, not much to get. The only parts that stand out are two I x IV x I lime green slopes.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The only special part of this set. We get a couple, the male with a new wetsuit printing and textured orange hair. Then, we get a female with a starry tank-top, featured in many other city sets. The male, is by far a very noteable minifigure. These minifigures also include two life-jackets.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>A quick, easy build, that a 7 year old probably&nbsp;won't need any help on. The build is from the&nbsp;bottom up, the only noticable technique is applying a Bionicle figure arm to a I x II brick with upward tube. Again, a very easy build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The usual size for a poly-bag set, about two inches long. It is very similar to the World Racers power boat. There is enough room for the two minifigures to stand, and this being a poly-bag, surprisingly includes two minifigures. This is a pleasing model.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a nice set, not MUCH to say, but a pleasing finished product with 2 minifigures! For $4.00 USD, 2 minifigures, and a jet ski! Buy it if you come across it! </p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5

"Jarod98","2011-07-14T20:31:49.45Z","Quite a Beauty Inside the Bag","This set is simply beautiful inside it's bag. I got this set for $2.11 because my aunt had given me the '7929-1: The Battle of Naboo' for a late birthday present. I got this along with the '4192-1: Fountain of Youth', so a review for that set should be popping up in the next couple of days. Onto the review...<br><br>I actually haven't opened this set up yet, but it is definitely worth the $3.99. It comes with two minifigs that haven't appeared in any sets before (although you could combine pieces from other sets to get the figs in this one), plus they both get life jackets. The boat itself is very small (about 1.5 inches) so you can't expect much out of it, but it's still really cute. If you do find it in TRU or any other store be sure to pick it up, because it's quite a beauty.<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T21:17:07.087Z","Fun at the Beach","<p>Set #30015 Jet Ski: LEGO has done the impossible with this Polybag set, they have included Two Mini-Figures, and one of them is even a female Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jet Ski is a Polybag set from the LEGO City Theme, and I piecked it up as soon as I found it on the shelf because I really like the look of it and I'm really not going to pass up owning two Mini-Figs for the price typically associated with one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jet Ski model itself is very quick and simple to build, using pieces that aren't too unique, although the colors are something new in a few cases. The way it's built makes it look a bit larger than a normal jet ski would be I think, however it's still a really good little model to include in your LEGO City Harbor/Marina display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are also fun, we have one male and one female, boyfriend and girlfriend or brother and sister perhaps? The female Mini-Figure has a double-sided torso with a t-shirt full of star patterns, she comes with plain blue pants and a brown ponytail hairpiece, as well as a yellow lifejacket piece. Her facial print is nice as well, with a big red-lipped smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The male also comes with a double-sided torso, featuring a diving suit or wet-suit, it includes a yellow lifejacket and un-printed legs. His hairpiece is one of the nice additions to City figures in the past few years, with molded detailing instead of an ordinary flat hairpiece. He also has a great smiling facial print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say you really can't go wrong with this Polybag set and should definitely snap it up as quickly as possible, if enough sales are made perhaps LEGO will begin featuring more Polybag sets with two Mini-Figures in them.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
