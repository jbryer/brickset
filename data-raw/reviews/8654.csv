<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10,000 of these were randomly included in star wars sets in 2007 as part of the 30th anniversary of star wars. It comes in a white poly bag with these details on it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifig is the usual minifig - 3 parts of the head, torso and legs, but the chrome gold plating and rarity has made it unique. As a minifig it does nothing different to any other C-3PO, but the chrome gold plating gives it a very nice look and shine, especially when compared to the pearl gold one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expect to pay about Â£100 for this in the sealed bag. At this price, it puts it in the realm of collectors only. For this amount of money, you can buy some excellent Lego sets (the modular fire station (10197), and both the winter bakery and winter toy shop). Thus, it really is an item for collectors only as it will look very good in your collection or on display, but it is not for playing with. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, unless you want to add a rare and collectable minfig to your collection, then I would recommend buying a set, or puting the money towards a UCS set&nbsp;instead. For collectors, this makes a great centrepiece to any star wars minifig display, hence a 3 star rating. </p>

This is the way C-3PO should have always been. The parts have a very nice and rare chrome gold color. I like this minifigure so much that I store it away from most of my other minifigures. If you enjoy collecting minifigures, then this is a must have, but you should just be smart and try your best to get it at a good price. It is one of the best minifigures ever made, expensive or not.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,3
