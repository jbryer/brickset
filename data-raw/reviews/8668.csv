<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildwise, this was pretty good, especially with the construction of the handle for the basket. There's a light pink pastel piece you get in the set that's not shown in the picture that's part of the basket. And with LEGO's penchant for extra pieces in sets, you've got two of them. The basket itself is a lighter green and in the end it looks alright for an Easter set. Though with the 1X1 round flat tile pieces, I'd have done more pastel and brighter colors for the effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The egg builds are similiar to the 3 eggs in the 2011 Easter Bunny set. You've got a rounded endcap element for one end, but then the other end, after you do the ""striping"" effect, is flat and when placed in a basket, it looks okay. The egg just pulled out and set laying&nbsp;around,&nbsp;it doesn't really look good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot to do playwise with this set, to me, this is a set like many of Christmas themed sets I've gotten in the past, you build the set and then set it somewhere for display and then later take it down for parts and possibly rebuild in later years.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the bright colors and the use of the snap plates for the articulating handle.&nbsp; I'm all for the ""usefulness"" of the product, as it does hold something -- Lego eggs.&nbsp; I would have preferred a stronger design for the bottom of the basket; just a few more plates would have done it.&nbsp; As it stands now, however, there are depressions at the bottom of the basket where there isn't plate reinforcement, so the eggs do rest nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's also a head-scratching anomaly that will have me comparing this against other sets from now on: </p>
<p>For some reason, the&nbsp;package photo of the basket is not what you get in the actual parts, the instruction's parts list, and the instruction's rendering.&nbsp; The photo shows two 1x6 bright yellowish&nbsp;green plates that flank two sides of the basket, providing stability and connection points to the design -- in addition to finishing the green basket rim look.&nbsp; In the actual parts, parts list, and the rendering, the 1x6 plates disappear and are instead replaced by four 1x2 plates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I wasn't quite satisfied with that, as it wasn't as advertised and I wanted the basket to be sturdier, so I bought two 1x6 off of Pick a Brick.&nbsp; To my surprise, when I tried to place the 1x6, it wouldn't fit!!&nbsp; The protruding ""joint"" of the articulating basket handle gets in the way.&nbsp; I made sure I had installed the joint-side in the right direction and tried cramming the darn 1x6 on, but I probably wouldn't have been able to do it without doing some minor scratching or damage to the plate.&nbsp; I then became really surprised at how the original bricklayer(s) managed to promote and proudly show a photo of an unconstructable design.&nbsp; At first, I thought the decrease in part size was just cost-cutting but now realize Lego was trying to fix a flaw.&nbsp; They couldn't re-take the photo?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I got lots of brightly-colored round plates as extra parts -- which were immediately useable as additional decoration on the basket, so no complaints to Lego in the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still love the basket.&nbsp; I had it up for decoration next to a stuffed bunny rabbit, until I realized the pain of cleaning accumulated dust off Legos.</p>
