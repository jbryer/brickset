<p>She's still not yet ready for the instructions in putting together sets, so I as parent built this set for her. You get a lot of brown bricks, mostly the sloped pieces. And once assembled, my daughter did enjoy playing with the rabbit. There's a new element piece for the ears so that they stick up that I believe is brand new? At least I've never seen it before and it looks like a specialty piece. Perfect for the ears in this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build for the eggs is okay, they don't look completely right as they're flat on the bottom with no element piece to complete out an oval shape for the eggs. Still amusing enough to put together and see an effort for multi-colored eggs. There's some pieces in here that after Easter, I'll be looking to take and use in other MOCs.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
