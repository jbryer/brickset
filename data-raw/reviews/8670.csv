"Higgins","2011-03-03T04:40:00.473Z","Brickly the Friendly Sea Serpent","I picked up the Brickly the Sea Serpent polybag (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">#40019</span> ages 6+) at the LEGO store for $4.99 USD. It was released at the same time as the 2011 Easter polybags. I had heard nothing about it until a couple hours before I went to buy it so it was kind of a nice little surprise.<br><br>There are 4 parts which go together fairly quick. The head - 2 body parts - and the tail. There isn't much to say about the build except that it's fun! 59 pieces overall. Two printed eye elements (kinda friendly looking - I don't think many brigands are running scared heheh). Lots of green 2x2 slopes. <br><br>The tail part falls over very easily. I bump my desk a lot and it's constantly falling over. I think it's a set people are going to love or hate. I personally give it a thumbs up.<br><br><h4>Images</h4>The narrow column cuts off the right side of the pictures but I didn't want to make them any smaller than they already are.

"cptjackleggow","2011-03-05T00:47:40.71Z","LeggoNess?","<p>Picked up the lego poly bag 40019-1: Brickley The Sea Serpent, amongst the Easter Basket Polybag, and Duplo Tiggers.&nbsp; Took Advantage of the VIP Double Points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the price of 4.99usd its a great ""novelty"" set.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1. Very Easy Build</p>
<p>2. Great Colors</p>
<p>3. Comical</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>The Easter Basket Polybag has more pieces for the same price 4 99usd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Great ""novelty"" set. It does have appeal, and its comical.&nbsp; Another person in the Lego Store bought one as well after I bought mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reminds me of the similar life size model at WaltDisneyWorld Marketplace, by the Lego Imagination Center, currently is under remodel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great piece to add novelty and ""character"".&nbsp; Why not put him in your lego City pond, lake, river, or medieval town.&nbsp; Who knows could even be on the moon or planet, as the New Lego City Space Shuttle explores the galaxy.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

For a mere GBP2.99 I couldn't resist taking him home with me.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The detached humps work really well in play. We had Brickly (his name is printed on the price label, &nbsp;not the cover) swimming over a Duplo baseboard under a road bridge.</div><div><br></div><div>Build-wise, there were no surprises. It took just over 10 minutes. &nbsp;A pair of green 2x2 jumper plates with a single stud in the middle were a welcome addition to my brick box.</div><div><br></div><div>For Â£3, you get 59 pieces (mostly green), a cute monster and a nice idea to steal in your own creations. Well worth the money.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"b0bb33z3r","2011-05-03T13:22:32.177Z","What's not to love about Lego's Mascot??","I got this set solely because it reminded me of the Brickley that's in the bay down in downtown Disney and the Brickley that's weaving his way around the Rockafeller Center store.&nbsp; Having my own little Brickley is a nice reminder at home about how much fun those store experiences are.&nbsp; <br><br>He's very simple to build and simple in design, but as a nice little novelty set he really is fun.&nbsp; My primary theme is Pirates, so he worked his way into one of my displays as well.&nbsp; His sum is definitely greater than his parts, and he's inspired me to try and build a more detailed model of Brickley. :)<br>",TRUE,4,2,3,4,3
