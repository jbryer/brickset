The only things which you can remove from these figures are the heads, the weapons and the headgear. The torso and the legs are glued and the legs are glued to the magnet. I don't think these glued magnets set will be a success, because lot's of people only wanted these sets for the minifigs. I think it's an okay set to have but I would recommend you to buy the sets you want more first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
