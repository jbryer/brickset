"AddictedToStyrene","2012-05-18T00:09:03.903Z","Glued together, but still a little loose.","<p>This is a keyring of a Star Wars character who has only appeared in one set - 8098 Clone Turbo Tank. 'Aayla Secura' is a Jedi Knight who appears in the Clone Wars series and the third Star Wars movie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure is nicely painted, in the big eyed Clone Wars style (rather than a traditional Lego or Star Wars movie character face). She is wearing a single sleeve crop top garment painted on her torso, and brown legs to represent brown pants. Attached to her head is a single mould combining her helmet and head-tentacles, and&nbsp;this can move a little on her head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this is a keyring, all parts are glued together, except the hands (dark bluish grey). There is still a lot more movement in the legs and arms than in a regular Lego minifig. She also has the steel chain and split ring stuck in her head. I don't advise trying to remove this without adult help, as you risk ruining the plastic. </p>
<p>The figure comes without any weapons (another Jedi losing a lightsabre? They should tie them on with a bit of string) but of course you can use spares from your collection. </p>",TRUE,4,1,1,2,3
