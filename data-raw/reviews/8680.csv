"MorkMan","2011-03-19T23:57:28.087Z","It can't be that bad, it's a Star Wars LEGO set!?!","<p>I have to start off by saying I was really looking forward to this set. &nbsp;So much so that I kept calling the Target stores near me to see if/when they had it. &nbsp;Finally, the day came that they had it and I swooped in to get it. &nbsp;I love the set and how it looks, but it's definitely what I call a Shelf Piece - meaning it isn't meant to touch or play with, but just to set on the shelf and look at it.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Pros</span></p>
<ul><li>It really does look like the AT-ST from the movie.</li><li>It goes great with the other Star Wars Mini Building Sets</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It falls apart easily (both pieces on the top of the 'head')</li><li>The legs, while&nbsp;movable, can't be posed the in any other ways without it falling over (i.e. the picture on the package)</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>I think it's a fair value for the money - it was $3. &nbsp;If you're waffling in any way as to getting it, go for it. &nbsp;But if you were looking for a great LEGO toy to play with and re-enact Chewbacca plowing through the woods of Endor with Ewoks in tow... then this isn't the set for you.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,3
"PORTER","2011-04-24T02:09:46.47Z","for $4 its a great mini set to display and just have fun with","<p>i was very excited when i finally found this mini-set. i never got the older one that came with the snowspeeder and im a sucker for star wars mini-sets.while the complete model does what it needs to by looking like its respected vehicle, i have to say i wish the ""hips could move.the legs are only stable in a standing position.but hey its lego! you can customize it to make it better! so really, this set is one cool,fun and easy way to have a cheap&nbsp;AT-ST to put on your star wars shelf!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pro 1 has the right design to look like a AT-ST. 
<li>Pro 2 its not expensive at all ($3.99). 
<li>â€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1 doesnt stand well when in a&nbsp;walking pose. 
<li>Con 2</li></ul>
<p>final verdict: i would totally get this if you see it! come on, $4 for a awesome little representation of the AT-ST. and besides its lego.if you want to improve the set by adding and removing peices andf making it more accurate than thats the best thing about lego, they are so many possibilities! its endless fun!</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,3,5
"Huge_Nerd","2011-10-12T15:41:45.98Z","Creative use of parts","I got this set for Easter, but never got around to reviewing it. This is my second baggy Star Wars set, and like the X-Wing, I'm amazed at how accurate it looks at this scale. It has a creative use of common parts, like the square ""flag"" or flap piece used on the front and the binoculars as guns. It's great for display, especially with similarly scaled models, but a bit fragile for play.",FALSE,4,3,4,2,5
"Basingstoke_01","2011-05-21T04:35:45.203Z","Wrong/missing piece alert","I picked this up with the Sun Newspaper today (Sat 21st) only to find the connector between the legs and the body didn't mate up upon inspection of the instructions, the piece that I had the forms the hips was a techinc piece with the ""phillips""hole not the smooth hole as in the instructions. Ok I did not pay much for this, but in every other lego set I own every piece was correct. Anyone else had this problem<br>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,5
