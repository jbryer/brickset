At first I tought that this cards will have some minifigs decoration for the design. Maybe not spade, heart, diamond, and club like a regular playing cards, but probably 4 unique kind of Lego? Probably brick, stud, slope, and tile? Or perhaps just bricks with 4 different colors? Or maybe just the Royal Cards (King, Queen, Jack, Ace, and Joker) that will have the minifig faces? Oh, the possibility is countless. <br><br>But I really disappointed when I open the package. Just the back side of the cards that got minifig printed. The playing side is just as plain as the design of regular cards. I can get one for free on the airplane, so why should I spend a couple of euros for this lousy cards? Lego should be ashamed by launching this cards.<br><br>I really hope that Lego will learn from this. I think they have a lot of possibility to include the unique and special Lego designs into the cards, instead of just putting some minifigs in the back of regular playing cards.<br><br>So, for you guys out there, I really hope that after you read my review, you don't buy this cards. Let me repeat, DON'T BUY THIS CARDS. Better you save your money to buy some sets, cause no matter how ugly the sets you buy, it definitely will be better than this card.<br><br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
