It's got two parts and comes assembled, so the building experience isn't great. Playability? Well, the arms move... The head is glued though, so it can't be changed. The legs unfortunately do not have have negative studs, so you can't put the minifig on a brick.<br>Value for money really isn't great. 2Gb isn't much these days; for half the price you can buy a USB stick with four times the capacity.<br>So here's a minifig that doesn't fit on a Lego brick and you can't play with, that doubles as a small and relatively expensive USB stick. And still, it's an irresistibly cute must-have.<br>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,1
