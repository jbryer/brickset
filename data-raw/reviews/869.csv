Now as a father of a 4yo boy, I still find the big yellow panels useful when my son demands fast construction of a house or a garage :)</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of bricks to play with</li><li>Easy to handle and (rebuild) figures</li><li>Still useful bricks</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Compared to today's shiny specialized bricks, it lacks detail</li><li></li><li>If not for the nostalgic value, I wouldn't buy it as of today, but since it's a '78 set I guess nobody buys it to play with :)</li></ul>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
