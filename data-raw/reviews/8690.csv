Listen to them carry on with their parent using all sorts of cute words....unless they are tired and at the meltdown state....in which case, head the other direction as far and fast as you can!<div><br></div><div>The supermarket is where many of them learn to identify their shapes, colors, foods, directions, and many other critical mileposts for maturing. I know this because I food shop almost every day spending at least 7 hours a week buying ingredients for family meals. It is fun observing little ones describe where something is in the store and what it is that their parent forgot to buy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Every child I have observed outside the store seems to have played supermarket at some point, and many love being the grocer or customer. This set makes it easier to assume those roles. I have played with it many times building Duploville towns, and it is perfect for creating a lifelike neighborhood.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>An important step in growing up is learning how to shop for food. Some of us began at age 5 by walking or riding our bikes to the neighborhood store carrying a shopping list and some money in our pockets. We learned to buy the milk or bread or other essentials that Mom needed every day, and how to pay for them and bring them home in the baskets of our bikes. But we had to pretend play with food and grocery shopping because we did not have sets like this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a wonderfully designed set with lots of educational potential AND fun play. It is a win win situation. the only thing I would change is to add about five more pieces of food because it is a bit pricey. Otherwise it is a solid winner. Have fun observing those tikes in the store, and playing with this set. It is okay to share it with the wee ones, but no one will force you to share your toys.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

We especially liked the bananas, apples, bread and coffee pieces.&nbsp; The choice of a wheelbarrow for food is a bit questionable, but what I really disliked in the set is the cake.&nbsp; It looks super scary and not at all appetising.&nbsp; Contrast that with the cakes from 2020+ (e.g., Modular House, Bakery) that have cute cakes that don&#39;t look like they were taken over by pink slime.&nbsp; We discovered this set as part of a large bundle we purchased from a family that had outgrown Duplos. I wouldn&#39;t have purchased it on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
