"Bumblepants","2011-06-10T11:02:04.783Z","Great set for getting little ones started in Duplo/Lego","<p>My 14 month old son just got this fire station and he loves it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - Set consists primarily of basic blocks. With the exception of a few accessories like the flame, hydrant, and hose, the bricks can easily be used for all sorts of other projects.<br></li><li>Pro 2 - The abundance of characters and vehicles. 2 firefighters, a dalmatian, and the two rescue vehicles give kids lots to play with. Lots of good details on each as well.<br></li><li>Pro 3 - Multitude of colors. By including various green and brown bricks for building trees it keeps it from being almost all red/dark red.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - The ladder does not grip the feet of the firemen well so it is hard for little children to use well.<br></li><li>Con 2 - The gigantic axe. I suppose it has to be big to avoid a choking hazard but once it is in the hands of a Duplo person it makes them look like something out of a bad 'Chucky' sequel. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, a lot of good basic bricks combined with several vehicles and people for a good price. My son and I have both enjoyed building with this set together. Previous Duplo fire stations have cost twice as much and included lots a big, one-purpose parts. The simplicity and low cost of this set are far superior.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
