"Huge_Nerd","2011-12-11T06:05:37.5Z","Another Bang-Up Baggy","This Vulture Droid, or Droid Starfighter is another polybag win by Lego. I've seen this set at Toys R Us in the US, but I got it from Kidsfest. This little set comes with some nice pieces like gray and dark blue rounded slopes. The final model looks just like the vehicle in Episode III or the Clone Wars show, minus the ""eyes"". Given that the ""head"" is attached by a droid arm, it is articulated so the vulture droid can stand in its perched position. This makes a great stocking stuffer!<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:12:19.4Z","Impressive Little Droid Fighter","<p><strong>Set #30055 Vulture Droid: </strong>LEGO Star Wars never fails to disappoint especially with their Polybags, cheaper alternatives for larger vehicle models in a perfect package. Here are the pros and cons of this set and then my opinion of it.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Captures the likeness of the Clone Wars era Vulture Droid quite nicely with dark blue and grey pieces.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Build is simple, though slightly repetitive for the wings/legs. Easy and fast to complete though.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fun to play with or display.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>While capable of adopting a &lsquo;walker&rsquo; mode I&rsquo;m afraid it just looks silly and doesn&rsquo;t capture the ability of the droid fighters to swap between flight and walker mode.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Difficult to come by from what I have seen.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>An awesome little design for LEGO Star Wars, I find this to be a fairly good representation and the price-per-piece isn&rsquo;t too terrible. I must admit though it won&rsquo;t be easy to find and I am slightly disappointed that it can&rsquo;t stand in walker mode the same way as larger models. I can understand why it would be difficult to include this feature, it is still unfortunate as it means that you can only ever have this displayed in flight mode.</p>

<p>Recommended to fans of the Theme and the younger builders who enjoy playing with an army of small sized spaceships when playing with LEGO.</p>
