They're certainy not as strong as the small rare earth magnets we already had on the fridge - for example, while these LEGO magnets are fine for holding up a few sheets of paper, heavier things like calendars will fall off.<br><br>There's not a great deal of playability to these magnets. The minifigures are glued to the magnets, and the torsos are glued to the legs. However, you do have the option of customising them slightly, as the hats are not glued on, and neither are the burglars' tools.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,2,3
