"M_Tron_Hero_Kodiak","2011-03-09T01:27:18.567Z","Keychain! Lights! Action!","<p>My wife bought this for me at I believe&nbsp;$4 USD.</p>
<p>I like this little light, you turn it on by pressing the LEGO logo on the mini-fig's torso.&nbsp;&nbsp; The back has screws, so it looks like you can replace the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a decent size keyring for keys and a swivel which is nice.</p>
<p>The lights are LED and fairly bright in a dark room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros 
<li>The Mini-fig light has all the movement a standard mini-fig has.&nbsp; So you can pose it however you wish. 
<li>The Lights are in the bottom of each leg.&nbsp; You can place one facing towards the direction of travel and then one pointing down to see what you are about to walk on. 
<li>Bright for a dark room. 
<li>Holds well in your hand. 
<li>Can sit up with the keys in front and doesn't fall over.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cons 
<li>The arms won't go past the head very well, and can pop the arms out of the socket.&nbsp; Don't know if this is a real con, but there isn't much bad about this key ring. 
<li>Fig is to big to accept utentils or weapons unlike the regular keychains. 
<li>You have to hold the logo button down to keep the lights on. 
<li>It is a little big to keep in your pocket with keys on it.</li></ul>
<p>For Brick ratings I give it an overall&nbsp;4 out of 5.&nbsp; It is like just any other key chain fig, but bigger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not build anything, so no building experience.</p>
<p>It comes completed and there is no parts.</p>
<p>For playability it could be used for lights when playing with LEGOS at night.&nbsp; I don't think it is big enough for a child under 3 years of age.</p>
<p>I think smaller mag lite brand flashlights run about 5-12 dollar range. I do not know how long the battery will last, but it's a good buy for both a flashlight, keyring and mini-fig.</p>

"AETerry","2011-06-13T12:50:26.777Z","LEGO Minifigure Key Light Review","<p>Finally I see this Keychain Light show up in the Archives here. I got this particular Key Light as a stocking stuffer for Christmas last year. So either Legoland California had them early or the year this key light is to have come out is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rated this a 1 for Building and Parts due to the fact that this isn't intended really as&nbsp;a toy. It's Gear, much like getting a LEGO hat, shirt, books, cards, ect. You don't really play with it other then posing the arms and legs or turning the light on and off. Incidently, you can angle the light(s) (one for each leg) by how you position the legs. The LEGO logo on the minifigure's torso is the button to hold down for activating the light on or off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Key Chain, I wouldn't really use it for one given that the minifigure is fairly large and I wouldn't want it stuffed into my pockets getting damaged or destroyed. Like many other Keychains I've had over the years, they often get worn out and sometimes break from use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a souveneir, Gear and LEGO themed item to display around the house to show my love for the LEGO brand, the minifigure gets a prominent place for display. It certainly is fun and cute to look at or play with.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,2,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-07-23T16:23:22.483Z","See in the Dark","<p>This set was actually supposed to be a Christmas present, but it fell into my mother's desk drawer and she could never find it. Next thing you know, it pops out of nowhere, and she gives it to me. I like it quite a bit- the figure looks nice, it feels smooth, and the arms are detachable and compatible with standard minifigures (and vice-versa). Not a bad little deal.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Cute</li><li>LEDs Works Great</li><li>Detachable arms, which are compatible with other minifigs</li><li>Easy to use</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Detaching the arms renders them a bit loose- mine tend to fall off a lot.</li><li>LEGO Logo on chest a bit lopsided</li></ul>
<p>Overall, nice little key light. If you see it, pick it up. Oh, and don't shine it into your face. It's really bright.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,1,4
