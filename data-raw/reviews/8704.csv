"SgtSmash","2011-05-23T17:33:32.91Z","I suppose every town needs a Pet Shop...","<p>Just bought the Lego Pet Shop this past weekend at the Lego store at the Mall of America.&nbsp;For the&nbsp;first time since these Modular buildings became available, I didn't buy the Pet Shop&nbsp;for me.&nbsp;I bought it for my 8 year old daughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She loves to round up all the dogs, cats and other animals from all the other sets we have (including the cows and pigs from our Farm sets), and sell&nbsp;them around town as pets for&nbsp;the town people. Plus, she had been using the 2nd floor of my Cafe Corner building as an apartment for her favorite town character. So buying the Pet Shop&nbsp;was a no-brainer,&nbsp;not just to go along with our&nbsp;other Modular&nbsp;buildings, but that&nbsp;it&nbsp;combines all of her favorite aspects of playing Legos with Dad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the set, as always, was fun. Lots of bricks to keep me busy for a good part of two days,&nbsp;unique colors (purple!), plus bricks I haven't seen yet. The light globe for the outside of the Pet Shop was a nice touch, plus&nbsp;I like how they managed to create a fish tank complete with the fish inside...plus two multi-colored parrots, a dog and a cat (with painted features). The apartment with painter was&nbsp;cool, but seems like a waste of floor space. My take is that this would have been&nbsp;better utilized outside&nbsp;of the building, but&nbsp;I suppose anything beats the interior of the Cafe Corner. Anyway, the building is a hit, and I'm looking forward to having a good time&nbsp;watching her play with this set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A side note, and&nbsp;perhaps it's just me, but&nbsp;the bricks seemed to have a light,&nbsp;airy&nbsp;feel to them these days.&nbsp;Has Lego begun having their bricks&nbsp;manufactured in China, like the collectible Minifigures? I am just wondering, as these bricks don't ""feel"" like they used to. If they are&nbsp;outsourcing, then perhaps it's high time that Lego pass along the&nbsp;savings to the customer.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Nased","2011-06-25T02:06:58.903Z","Smallest but Fantastic, Neat and Soothing to the Eyes!","The idea of having two smaller modular buildings in a modular set was not accepted by me when I first saw the images online. However, upon completion of this set, I am very pleased to put this set together with the previous modular sets and this set simply sits perfectly in the row of buildings. Here are the description of the interior design and pros of this set.<br><br><br>1st red building:<br>This seems to be the residential house of the lady in red outfit in this set. This is a three levels building.<br><br>Level 1: The first level has a toilet with nice toilet bowl; sofa; telephone; hat stand; table with vase of flowers; spiral staircase that leads to level 2; door bell and a small garden outside. There is a hidden door to go down to the basement and the basement linked to a back door.<br><br>Level 2: This level is generally quite empty. There is a worker doing some paint job on the wall. I like the design of the box/bucket of paint on the floor. It allows the person building this set to live up to the imagination that the worker is real.<br><br>Level 3: This level has a few boxes. So one can assume that the lady has just moved in and she has not unpacked her personal belongings. I love the little garden at the back of level 3. It's beautiful! <br><br>The plan view of this red building has a ""L"" shape due to the balcony garden on level 3. It breaks the monotony of the modular buildings of the past. The interior design, furniture and even exterior design are simply ingenious and fantastic. I really like this building very much.<br><br><br>2nd blue building:<br>As I move on to the Pet Shop (blue building), I got even more excited. The blue building is a Pet Shop with a couple of animals. The pets available in the shop are dog; cat, orange fish and parrots. I think the mouse is a stray mouse that doesn't live in the shop. I assume that the yellow frog on the shelf is some plush toy for the dog to bite. The grey frog is used as a decoration on the front door. <br><br>Level 1: The abundance of animals separated by their barriers, cashier counter, shelf with pet merchandise, tiled floor and unique sand blue bricks on the exterior gave a perfect impression to any LEGO builder. I got really impressed when I did the SNOT ""PETS"" sign board. The technique has ""improved"" and everything looks so Neat! Last thing about level 1, the white lamp post that was present in all previous modular houses can be found outside the Pet Shop.<br><br>Level 2 &amp; 3: These two levels are the residential place of the Pet Shop owner. One can also imagine that the pet shop owner is a vet and the little girl on green bicycle is his daughter. I love the interior design of level 2 and 3 as there is a stove, sink, oven, table and chair; and there is a comfortable looking bed on level 3. <br><br><br>Conclusion:<br>I have to be honest that I didn't expect myself to like this set so much when it first came out. However, one must really lay his/her hands on this set and build it to fall in love with it. The interior design; concept and ideas; colours of bricks; and everything else of the Pet Shop is a WIN. It's even more awesome and breathtaking when you put the two buildings beside the previous sets. <br><br>The height is lower than previous sets and number of pieces is lower too. However, the uneven height makes the entire street of modular houses more realistic. Congratulations to LEGO and hopefully I can put something just as nice beside Pet Shop in 2012.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sudorum","2011-05-26T16:35:11.927Z","Superb To The Extreme","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>A marvelous set has been unleashed into the world, and its name is the Pet Shop. Loaded with new pieces and minifigures, this lego is bound to please.&nbsp;All three minifigures: the woman, the man, and little girl, have new designs on the torso pieces. A green bicycle is supplied for the tike.	The building located next to the pet shop is an apartment complete with an empty basement which can be accessed by a new trap door piece on the first floor or by a cellar door in the back. A new design for the trash can in the back yard has also been utilized. The back yard can be accessed by a door in the back (where else?) of the apartment. A spiral staircase connects all three floors.The lower floor is furnished with a couch, a telephone, a pot of flowers, a hat stand with an interesting new piece to hold a blue cap, and a bathroom that makes a ""porter potty"" look spacious. Not to worry, a small bathroom is better than no bathroom at all.&nbsp;The second floor features a painter with a roller, a paint tray, and a stool. The top floor is empty except for two bland boxes and a rooftop garden located outside the walls. A stair case from the outside (with a lamp under the arch) connects the three floors.	<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The focal point of this lego, the pet shop, is even better. The sidewalk features a stand for a red ball and two bones. An entirely new piece shaped like an L contains the bones. The bottom of the store is by far the best;the floor is tiled, there is a dog kennel, a cat pen, a cash register with a drawer loaded with $100, a pet toy rack (with a surprising yellow frog), a rack for two red and green parrots, and an aquarium with a new orange fish.The dog and cat included also have new designs instead of the trite solid color molds.&nbsp;A back door leads outside to a unique wash bucket with a comb and a crate. The second and third floors of the shop, however, are peculiar and rather infelicitous. These floors are furnished like an apartment: the second floor has a chair, a cup stand, a fire place, a coffee maker, a sink, and an oven/grill. The third floor houses a bed with a lamp. To me, the set would make more sense if the 2nd and 3rd floors of the pet shop had the insides of the apartment building and the same floors of the apartment had the insides of the pet shop which is furnished like a living space.	Despite the oddity, this is a great set, perfectly compatible with the other sidewalk buildings. This is a set you cannot afford to miss. I would highly recommend buying it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Dodge","2011-07-12T00:51:34.19Z","Alone or in pairs, this is a GREAT set!","<p>This set did not disappoint!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True to the modular-style buildings that preceeded it, the ""Pet Shop"" has a grat look and feel to it's buildings.&nbsp; Breaking them down for ease of review, here's how they stack up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown Building:</p>
<p>This building has a really quaint feel about it.&nbsp; It has a nice finished (and furnished) first floor with a couch, flowers, WC and more.&nbsp; The second floor, under renovation apparently, adds a nice touch to the otherwise finished set with a painter hard at work.&nbsp; The top floor boasts some nice opening windows and a splash of colour as well.&nbsp; The flowers and plants serve as a way to break up the reddish nature of the buildings colour scheme, as do the green doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pet Shop:</p>
<p>I've currently placed this building next to the Green Gorcer and MAN do they make a pair!&nbsp; The muted colouring of gives it the realism that is to be expected of from the line.&nbsp; The shop interior itself is chalk-full of neat additions from the pets to the pet accessories!&nbsp; The loft apartment gives a modern touch to the neatly-styles facade.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only drawback to this buidling was during the construction process where it took a good two minutes of searching for a ""lost bag"" to realize that the pieces needed were sand-blue and not bluish-grey.&nbsp; They looked far too similar in the instruction manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these buildings are top notch and an AWESOME addition to the modular group of buildings!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

"Alexdiazb","2012-06-23T11:01:04.897Z","A mix between New York and London in a set! Interesting...","<p><strong>About the Pet Shop:</strong></p><p>Last week, I decided to finally open the nice box containing the ""Pet Shop"" set. I bought it&nbsp;almost inmediately after it was released in the Lego Shop. I must say this set is a quite good complement for your Lego ""City Center"". This because it add another building to your city, and also 2 nice places where your minifigures can live. Let's start then with the review.</p><p>Building the ""Pet Shop"" took me a 5 days in 2 weeks. I always like to find the right moment to build having a cup of coffee or tea and then with some background music start the action.</p><p><strong>The Box:</strong></p><p>Once the box opened, I got a nice surprise, which is actually a very practical feature Lego put on the boxes of modular sets (I think since this one as the Town Hall has it also) and it is the instructions in a bag with a piece of paperboard to avoid they get folded or damage when the bags moves around the box. </p><p>The instructions come in 2 booklets, first one covering the house and the second one the pet shop itself. The bags are splitted in 4 numbers 1 and 2 covering the house and 3 and 4 the pet shop. I must say one of the things i love the most in Lego is the design of the boxes. It's always an ""eye-candy"".</p><p><strong>The House:</strong></p><p>I started with the house, my first impression is that the building is quite impressive. I like the detail of the toilet on the first floor, however I find it complicated to put the figure inside. The sofa, the telephone and the stairs in spiral are quite amazing. I must say I loved the stairs. I liked also the basement with the dors outside and the trap inside the house. </p><p>The second floor is also big, the detail of the minifig paiting and the paint roller are quite cool. The floor is empty as I suppose the minifig living there just moved in. Then the third floor with the nice opening windows on the front and the cool terrace with the garden and the blue-orange transparent bricks are really nice. They give a modern flair to the house.</p><p>In my opinion the house looks like a nice Londonian house, the door and the stairs as well the style give me that sensation. I think it add a nice flair to your Lego ""City Center"".</p><p><strong>The Pet Shop:</strong></p><p>Then I started with the Pet Shop. The animals are quite good! I like specially the parrots who looks more like a ""Guacamaya"" (name of the bird in Venezuela). The shop is quite nice, i liked the floor but besides that is just that, a pet shop. The main point on this part of the set is:</p><p><strong>The Loft:</strong></p><p>And this is what i loved the most. The stairs are a little bit tricky and the floor can be a little bit unstable but not a matter if handled with care while building. The loft has a lot of space and i loved the kitchen with the oven, the sink and the necessary coffee machine...Expresso someone? Also the small table with the chair are quite cool. I love the fact Lego is putting more and more furniture on the modular sets. It adds more value to them.</p><p>The second floor has a nice bed, a night lamp and nice skylight. I really loved the loft as is quite modern. Reminds me a New York style loft as in some Tv Series and movies.</p><p><strong>The plus:</strong></p><p>The best feature is the fact you can put them together or split them. I personally put the Pet Shop next to the Grand Emporium and the house next to the Town Hall. Is a nice feature and you can place/combine the building your own way.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>This is really a set to have if you want to expand your Lego ""City Center"". It adds the shop and as well 2 places for living. You can play with it a lot and never get bored. Lot of  ""Eye-candy"" and it simply looks amazing. A good complement for this series.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you liked this review.</p><p><br>Thanks a lot for reading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alex</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"Harmonious_Building","2012-08-13T14:53:25.653Z","Pet shop toys. ","<p>In the interest of not going overboard in reviewing a set of this magnitude, I will do my best to capture what I found to be the highlights and unexpected surprises that came with my first Modular Building purchase. Like many ""latecomers"" to the scene, I came out of my ""dark ages"" only after Cafe Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10182-1"">10182</a>) and other sets had sadly come to pass, but, on the principle of ""better late than never"", I cannot tell you how happy I am to have finally picked this set up. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so, I will try and talk about some information that I wish I had known prior to purchasing this set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine that the two natural factors that would make any&nbsp;neophyte to the Modular Building line are (a) cost and (b) available shelf space.&nbsp;With regards to (b), the Pet Shop is obviously much larger than any other ""regular"" City building, but considering that the total footprint&nbsp;occupies a 16 x 16 stud area, it's actually not incredibly unwieldy (unlike, say, The Battle of Helm's Deep (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=9474-1"">9474</a>), which sprawls all over the place). The other dimensions can be found right on this site, so you can check that out for yourself. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What&nbsp;makes this&nbsp;kit a lot easier in terms of placement is that it consists of two buildings separated by a pair of&nbsp;Technic pins, so if width ends up being a problem, they can be easily broken apart - which&nbsp;you may want to do anyway, if only for variety's sake. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Expect to spend a&nbsp;good long time putting these buildings together - which is really something that you would hope for if you're spending this much money on it. I think this took me maybe four or five hours in total spread over a number of days, but, of course, I was taking my time and not out to set any speed records. As with any Modular Building, expect to see interesting construction techniques that you may not have thought of yourself (although what really blew my mind is that the&nbsp;dog can actually stand diagonally across studs). I feel that the&nbsp;brown apartment had a bit more thought put into&nbsp;it compared to the actual pet shop, but they're both great builds, of course. Speaking of which, the ""pet shop"" really only occupies the bottom floor of the blue building. The rest is pretty much residential area. The top&nbsp;two floors of the brown building are ""under construction"", which means they aren't furnished, but that shouldn't stop you from putting it furniture of your own (in fact, I suspect that that's the point). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The models are easily taken apart and put back together in sections, which is great for if you expect these models to be played with. Just be careful&nbsp;not to grab them too far up if you're transporting this or the bottom will fall right out. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Minifigs are actually more or less a footnote to this set. All of the Minifigs come with the classic LEGO smiley face, which is cool from a nostalgia point of view but a little weird otherwise since the torso prints and hairpieces all have the usual detail that we've come to expect from contemporary Minifig parts. You'll definitely want to have a lot of Minifigs to keep this set looking populated, which is perhaps a good enough reason to continue investing in ""regular"" City sets, what with their newfangled face prints and all. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am really happy with how this model looks, and I am now completely sold on the entire line of Modular Buildings, which means the end&nbsp;of my retirement fund, but whatever. These buildings are just flat-out beautiful, the kind of things that you see in LEGO shows and wish that you had the time, talent, and parts to build. If you've ever been inspired by intricate and large-scale LEGO models, give this set and try and you'll probably be hooked. The price would probably be more than enough to scare anyone else away.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"zipsforbananas","2013-05-16T11:46:22.493Z","What you always wished your self-built house could be!","<p>To my mind this is one of the best sets Lego has ever produced. It's what you always wished you could build when you were a kid but never had the pieces to do; it feels like a little piece of a Legoland display in your own home!</p><p>The real beauty of this set is that it has two parts. It gives it a much nicer overall size than the other modular building, with each part having a much more compact feel. And it means you can arrange it a number of different ways, giving a lot of variety to a street. Most importantly I'd say it's the best of the modular sets to start on. Something about having two buildings is so rewarding, you'll have 6 different ways to arrange things when you buy just one more set. And I think most importantly it's essentially two residential houses, whereas most of the other sets are functional buildings like the fire station, town hall and cinema; houses feel so much more personal.</p><p>Most things you need to know about parts are quite obvious from the look of the set: a good number of windows, brown, sand blue bricks and dark red slopes, lots of tiles covering the baseplate, etc. And the value is really good; £120 is a lot of money, but for 2,000 bricks it's actually quite cheap! And it's maybe not the best next to some of the other modular sets, but you have to consider that you have two buildings with three floors each, where some others only really have two floors.</p><p>The build is superb as you would expect, and involving throughout. Again, the fact you have two buildings and so are building 6 different modules plus the two roofs makes it very pleasing: you get to complete sections and feel like you're achieving often, especially as you begin building the basement of the house and so you're finishing a 'floor' after just a few pages. The handy separation of the buildings into a booklet each makes it good fun to build with someone else too. And if you're not such a confident builder the clear stopping points let you do it over a few days and feel like you were meant to be doing it that way! (Indeed, who says you're not?)</p><p>There are some really great techniques involved too. The way the bottom of the bay window is attached is superb, as well as the hinged bay window itself. Everything around the door of the house is great, railings, porch, doorbell and hat stand. The spiral staircase is great and the way the windows are set back is too. The furniture in the ground floor of the house and in the apartment is fun. The fish tank and the toilet are great fun to build too. And of course the pet shop sign is the highlight of the build.</p><p>The finished model is just excellent for whatever you might want it for. If you want to display it, it looks truly brilliant. If you want to play with it, it is accessible and varied enough. The painter in the house is hilarious with the plate on the wall being where he's painted, and though most note the lack of furniture I love the cardboard boxes on the top floor. The house also has a good amount going on on the ground floor, with a sofa, flowers in the window, a hat rack, entry to the basement and a toilet. The garden roof is a very nice touch, and the little blue and orange window looks great. The pet shop is pleasingly well stocked with animals and bits, and the mouse hole with the cat crouching at it is a nice touch. And the apartment is different enough to the house, with a nice open plan main area and the bed on a kind of mezzanine floor.<br>For play, the pet shop makes it more than just a house, with the fish tank being easily moved. The box suggests that mum has sent the little girl to buy a pet for their new house while dad paints - not a bad start, who knows where an active imagination will take things?<br>The only slight issue is that the ground floor of the pet shop is quite tall, so getting your hand down into it is awkward, and quite annoying if you've posed figures and they fall over, amongst other things!</p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4><p></p>
<ul><li>Great value and you feel like you have a lot at the end</li><li>Superb build, a good number of advanced techniques</li><li>Display and play potential is through the roof, and the normal four figures are perfect</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Awkward access to the pet shop because of the height</li></ul>
<p>Well, there's hardly a bad word to say. It's a great standalone set. I think it's the obvious place to start a modular building collection. Be careful though, it's addictive - I ordered another set online the day I bought this in store and then started sourcing pieces for one of the discontinued sets!<br>If you're looking at the reviews you're probably quite close to buying it anyway or are maybe just wanting to choose which modular set to get first. Let me help you... You do want this set. And yes, this is the best set to get first!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"EpicMindvolt","2014-10-21T23:41:58.17Z","Awesome addition to modular buildings line!","<p>This set is awesome! It has lots of cool building techniques and parts. The price is also great because it come out to being about 7.3 cents (US) per piece.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box is huge. Since it is so big, there are lots of pictures of the playability features on the back of the box. The instructions are just like any other set, but it does come with a cardboard backing so they don&#39;t get folded/creased. Good thinking LEGO. (There are probably other sets with the cardboard backing, but this is the only one that I know of.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>The parts are normal, and lots of them come in hundreds of other sets. But the way they designed this one with those normal parts is amazing. The printed details on the dog and cat are awesome, and you don&#39;t find those very often. Also, they used garage door bricks (like the ones used in fire/police stations) to make the second floor of the actual pet shop look detailed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>The minifigures are not that special in any way, but if you need random civilians in stop-motions, these figures come in handy. Also, I like how they brought back the classic head. (Design #001)</p>

<p>Overall, the minifigures are great!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>I got this for my birthday, as well as some Galaxy Squad and City sets. I built the other ones in about and hour. Then it was time for the Pet Shop. I built it in five hours, and only got up out of my chair twice. (I wasn&#39;t gone from my seat for over 2 minutes.) Awesome new building techniques were discovered when building this set as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>All I have to say about the completed model is that it looked epic and had lots of playability included.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:</h3>

<p>I give this set on average a 4.8 out of five stars. I would recommend this set to anyone. (Except kids 6 years or younger) That concludes one of the longest reviews I&#39;ve ever written. So if a review on this set is this long, the set is probably really awesome.</p>

"mcleod4568","2015-03-01T19:46:13.613Z","A Great start to my Lego building phase!","<p>This was my first big Lego purchase since I decided to get into Lego building again after a God only knows how long absence. But it was so worth it!</p>

<p>The building is, as you probably know, split into two different buildings, each with it&#39;s own 16x32 baseplate and instruction book. So they can be built in any order and can fit together either way and can even be placed around different modular buildings and don&#39;t have to fit together if you like.</p>

<p>The interior detailing is slightly lacking when you compare it to something like the Palace Cinema or Detective&#39;s Office, but this does not detract from the overall awesomeness of the model. It was great fun to put together, especially finding out how the different levels of each building fit together and how the lettering on the Pet Shop building was achieved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I especially liked the Town House section of the building - it has a handy basement area which might seem pointless when you are building it, but definitely comes in handy for storing spare parts - all the Lego sets I have bought have had at least 4 or 5 spare parts if not more. Seeing as I have quite a few sets now that is a lot of spare parts lying around. The basement of the Town House is a perfect place to put them.</p>

<p>It was incredibly fun to build - I think I spent a solid 8 hours on building the Town House part one day simply through experiencing the joy and addiction of constructing a large item (just one more step, just one more step etc etc).</p>

<p>If you are considering getting into Lego, this is a great place to start.</p>

<p>The box is the usually size for a modular box and has pictures on the back suggesting some of the playability aspects to the building.</p>

<p>There is two different instruction booklets one for the House and one for the Shop&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>All the parts came in 16 different bags all ranging from numbers 1-4.</p>

<p>There is two 16x32&nbsp;Green baseplates in this set instead of a large 32x32. Just incase you wanted the two different buildings in sepret&nbsp;locations</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is 4&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;in this set: Women (House Owner?) Decorator doing some touching up. a kid on a bicycle. and the Pet Shop owner/worker</p>

<p>All the minifigures&nbsp;have the classic face&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun it was separated into 4 diffrent&nbsp;parts. 1- The ground floor&nbsp;in the house 2-The remains to the house. 3- The shop floor and the sign. 4- the remains to the pet shop&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is nice and eye catching. It is a bit bigger than the detectives office and the house and the shop can swap positions.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall i would recommend&nbsp;getting the Pet Shop modular as it is a brillant&nbsp;addition to any collection. I would also recommend getting this modular first as it could be the next one to retire&nbsp;</p>

<p>The apartment/house was a good build, loved building the bay windows &amp; the curved stairs.&nbsp;The actual Pet Shop building was a fun build. Loved the SNOT technique in the &quot;PETS&quot; lettering.</p>

<p>The Parts</p>

<p>Nice light blue, dark red &amp; brown pieces. Only disappointment&nbsp;is that I was missing 1 white 1x2 tile, luckily I had plenty in my collection already.</p>

<p>Overall summary</p>

<p>Overall this was a really good set. This was only my 2nd modular building (my 1st being the Parisian Restaurant in which that was an awesome set).&nbsp;</p>

"KongZilla","2017-12-27T22:56:29.843Z","Lego Pet Shop Review","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lego modular building sets are among the most popular (if not the&nbsp;most) of all Lego sets for adults. When this set came out I was very excited to get it. When I finally did on at Christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;one year I could not believe my eyes. There it was sitting by the Christmas tree and it was mine. Anyway I built it over the next two days (I didn&rsquo;t have time to do anything on Christmas because of a family get together) and&nbsp;I managed to secure some time in the next few days and finished it on the 2nd. What stood before me was an amazing Lego set and it was the largest in my collection, it was a beauty.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mini figures aren&rsquo;t anything amazing but they do come with some nice torsos for city figures. The heads are all plain with a smiley face just like the rest of them from the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The age range on the box suggests 16+ just like the other modular building sets. This one is much easier to assemble than the others though. I would say a 10 year old could probably do it because I was ten when I built it, but I would say 12 would be more favorable to less knowledgeable builders.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The details on this set aren&rsquo;t as great as the others, and there is a great lack of ornamentation even though there a a few particularly heavily decorated areas. The fact that these two buildings can come apart really adds to the playability of the set, and potential for the displays.&nbsp;Overall I would say it is an exceptionally great set.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
