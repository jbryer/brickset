<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice sized model.&nbsp; Not to big nor to small</li><li>Well designed model. Doors, engine and roof open and close very smoothly. <br></li><li>Most of the kit is proportionate.<br></li><li>Not difficult or challenging to put together.</li><li>Very good detail.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No special VW pieces. <br></li><li>Not difficult or challenging to put together. <br></li><li>Front wheels don't steer.&nbsp; <br></li><li><br></li><li><br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>I enjoyed building this model.&nbsp; Very happy with my purchase. I would have changed the color scheme.&nbsp; It would of been nice to have an display card with information on the actual bus. All-in-all, a good buy for your money.&nbsp; I may modify it so the front wheels steer.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5

"Monty","2011-10-25T01:59:53.453Z","Pretty ""Splitty""","<p>I haven’t bought a large set for a while now, but when I saw the camper was to be released I was as enthusiastic about it as everyone else. I made it over the weekend and have to say I was not disappointed.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It is the first set I have bought where the instruction books (2 here) and the stickers have come in a plastic bag with a cardboard insert to stop them getting damaged. Many times in the past I have opened boxes to find creased instruction booklets and sticker sheets – so well done Lego. The box itself is of the type where it can be closed using a little tag and slot and can be kept for future use.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>There are numerous plastic bags not numbered so it is a case of tip them all out and look around for your parts. The build is not particularly complex, but it can get a bit fiddly when you are trying to hold several parts together that open or move, and the side with the opening doors is a bit flimsy. In this respect it would be easier if the front door hinges were not quite so loose – I think it has something to do with the colour as in when I have used them in black I recall them being stiffer.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The one part of the design I never liked from the pre-release publicity shots was the rear grilles/louvres which Lego did using ladder bricks which protrude from the body side. They should be set into the body side and as such flush with it. I think the way Lego has done them looks cheap and nasty, and it lets down an otherwise excellent looking model. Before building, I worked out a way to produce a more authentic look with grille bricks, which necessarily meant modifying that part of the build as I went along with extra parts from the spares box, but I think it looks much better. Perhaps Lego could have done it this way as it did not use that many parts, and for a set rated 16+ what I did was not that complicated for an experienced builder.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I also made my build more complicated by deciding to do mine as a U.K. right hand drive version. This is a mirror image of the set as it comes (except for the fuel filler) and I actually used a mirror to look at the instructions as it made it easier to work out.&nbsp;It slowed the build a little, having to remember the step 1,2,3... order was also reversed in the mirror. &nbsp;Once I was back on the components that weren’t handed like the roof, speed picked up once more.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The interior is wonderful with its working rear seat which turns into a bed. I have to say as an Aston Villa fan I wholeheartedly approve of the claret and blue colour scheme of the seats. There is a sink with cupboard underneath, and a closet with mirror door as well as a folding table and shelves on the inside of the opening side door. There is a picture, a 1960s lava lamp, a plant, a brush and a frying pan (no cooker?) and the much publicised “build Lego” T shirt. The curtains provided fit quite well and provide that finishing touch.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>On the exterior all doors open as does the engine compartment cover which reveals a representation of the VW engine – which is done quite well. The windscreen opens too, as does the rear door/window. The expanding roof requires you to build a scissor raising table and then wrap the supplied cloth around it and put bricks and plates on top and around to hide it when folded down. It works really well – just the right amount of stiffness. As per the instructions, the roof is designed to come off, but I think it needs a few&nbsp;more studs rather than plates to give the roof more to hang on to as it comes off too easily as built. There are hardly any studs on the non-doors side. With all these working features it has maximum playability as well as good looks.<br/></p>
<p>There are stickers for the split screen windscreen bar as well as for the sides of the rear windows. They are also necessary for the interior picture and the T - shirt. There are silver mirror finish stickers for the front VW logo and the mirror on the closet door.<br/></p>
<p>Not sure if the brick used for the front wheel arches is a new element – I have not come across it before - it seems to have a reduced curve which fits the wheels really well. For those who would have preferred working steering it is difficult to see how it could be incorporated, as there is not much clearance, but if it can be done that would make it even better. I enjoy the challenge of “improving” or customising sets as well as building MOCs. My final customisations involved detailing the engine and the cab and adding&nbsp;an aerial and a&nbsp;mirror tp the passenger side. </p>
<p>I wanted an authentic&nbsp;1960’s U.K. look to my ""Splitty""&nbsp;so I made MOC stickers for 1966 ""D"" reg number plates with matching&nbsp;tax disc and AA window&nbsp;sticker.&nbsp;There is also a GB sticker and a VW Service Sticker on the rear window. The final touch was to replace the inside picture with one of my own beach photos shrunk to fit,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;T -&nbsp;shirt with one showing&nbsp;the 1966 soccer World Cup mascot&nbsp;""World Cup Willie"" as 1966 was the year England hosted and won the tournament.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>For once I was entirely satisfied with the price at 80 GBP. I thought it was more than value for money compared to other large sets I have bought in the past.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The Lego designer (guy in the YouTube video?) has done a brilliant job here – very clever and has used techniques for one or two things I don’t think I would have thought of. On all counts, this set merits a maximum score and is now up there with the Fokker DR1 and Technic Tow Truck as one of my all time favourite Lego models.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Images are available on my&nbsp;Brickshelf page if you want to look. <br/>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Buckbrick","2011-10-13T05:19:06.723Z","Wow what a set!","<p>When the preliminary pics of this set was leaked, as with many, I found it unappealing. But after Lego put out the official pics and a promo video of it, it immediately shot to the top of my&nbsp;want/must buy&nbsp;list. It may well possibly be the most desireable set all year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model:</p>
<p>The van looks gorgeous. The designer did a great job in translating the many curves of the van into brick elements that were great fun to build, entirely unlike the previous VW model, the Beetle that was mainly a studs-on-top build. The T1 is in red, but I was kinda hoping that it would be in a&nbsp;vermillion colour, much like the actual vehicle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess the interior is the main highlight of the vehicle for most. I for one found it a little overboard at times. You get a folding table, 2 seats (one folds down as a bed), lava lamp, the amusing T-shirt, a sink and mirror, chequered floorboard...&nbsp;The build was definitely fun: it's like a modular building&nbsp;on wheels!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build:</p>
<p>It took me an afternoon to put the 1332 pieces together, so it wasn't a tough build. It was definitely great fun! I'm in awe of how many items that can be shoehorned into a set this size. Lots of red and white and miscellaneous hard to find pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stickers!</p>
<p>Love 'em or hate 'em, they do finish the look very well and I do apply them. You get the VW emblem printed in shiny sticker, along with the mirror sticker. My only peeve is the 3 trans window sticker pieces that I left out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Really you ought to be running out and buy it now. It will go down in Lego history as one of the&nbsp;classic sets along the same line as the Emerald Night - both elegant and great models.&nbsp;I love the size of the set, and you can display it almost anywhere. I got it for 210SGD and it's definitely worth every penny.</p>

"DrOrrery","2011-12-29T08:02:49.76Z","It's Lego Jim, but not as we know it","<p><span style=""background-color: white; "">I got this for Christmas and stayed up til midnight doing it after my youngest had gone to bed. &nbsp;It is an undeniably impressive piece, but I find myself with mixed feelings about it, which I will hopefully get across in this review.</span></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Hooray for instructions wrapped against cardboard! &nbsp;And a small cheer for sticker sheets wrapped against cardboard as well. &nbsp;Can't complain too much about the stickers in this one, given how unique they are.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Given the accuracy of the look that has been achieved here, there are actually very few special parts used for the majority of the build. &nbsp;Those that have are generally to do with the interior details, like the green goblet, T-shirt piece and the taps.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build itself was both straight forward and really interesting. &nbsp;The model starts from the floor and builds up, as you might expect. &nbsp;Nothing too difficult, but lots of clever details for allowing sideways curves, like the bumpers and side panels, and lots of interior detail. &nbsp;The moving seat that flattens out into a bed is actually held by two android arms. &nbsp;That's all that is keeping it connected to the model, and yet it is very stable in both the upright and flattened position. &nbsp;Also, lots of opening and closing parts, like the rear engine compartment, the doors and the rear window. &nbsp;And of course, the cloth pop-up roof. &nbsp;I had no idea how the designer had done this, but it turned out to be brilliantly simply and elegant, and it works incredibly well. &nbsp;About the last thing that's put on are the rear wheel arches that come down slightly over the top of the wheel, and even this detail is simple but beautifully done (especially since one of them contains the petrol cap).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>First off, the completed model looks astounding. &nbsp;The curves are incredible, and the only surface with studs on is the roof. &nbsp;I'm glad they left them there, because otherwise it would be fairly easy to mistake it for a large die-cast model on first glance. &nbsp;And second. &nbsp;As a model and an attempt at realism, this is a triumph. &nbsp;I can't think of anything Lego has done that is even in the same league as this. &nbsp;But the flip side to this is, to me, after building it, it doesn't really feel like Lego anymore. &nbsp;With a build of similar size, like say the recent Millennium Falcon, I spend ages marveling at all the great details done in Lego and thinking about ways I might want to modify it, and actually playing with it. &nbsp;With this model, I spent ages looking at the details thinking ""wow, did Volkswagen actually do that? &nbsp;What a great thing to have in a van."" &nbsp;My focus was really more on how cool the actual van was rather than the Lego I'd used to make it, because, and I know this sounds a little strange, it's such a good model that it almost stops being Lego.</div><div><br></div><div>Which leads to the one gripe I have about it, it's not particularly robust. &nbsp;Actually, most of it is incredibly robust, but some sections, especially the removable roof, doors and bumpers, I find finicky and easily broken or hard to get to fit properly. &nbsp;This can make it quite difficult to pick up, but again, that's partly because this is intended really to be made and then kept on a shelf. &nbsp;Now, that's not a complaint, any more than one would complain that the new Super Star Destroyer isn't particularly swooshable, but it is the first Lego model I've owned where that is true.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>The bottom line is this is an amazing set, but I think this set is a different beast to most sets out there, and I think how much you like it will be affected by that. &nbsp;If you like a great build, this has it in spades. &nbsp;If you want to be amazed by how good a model can look, ditto. &nbsp;But if you actually like playing with Lego, I'm not sure this one's for you.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,2,4

"Duq","2012-01-04T17:09:42.153Z","Nothing is perfect but this comes pretty close!","<p>In 2008 Lego released set 10187, the iconic Volkswagen Beetle. This time we're treated to it's cousin, the camper van. It's slightly smaller than the Beetle but it makes up for that in details.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p></p><p>There's usually not much to say about a box but this is one is different. The front shows the model against a real life background image of the Swiss Alps. On the back of the box is the same backdrop with a number of snapshots of details of the model as well as a picture of the original van.</p><p>There are two instruction books. They come in a plastic bag with a cardboard backing to keep them flat.</p><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p></p><p>This is an interesting model to build because it is so full of details. It starts with a simple chassis but soon you're adding interior details, the engine and then the outside of the car.</p><p>The box says '16+' and while I think that may be a little high this is clearly not a set for children to build. There are no numbered bags so at the start you have well over a thousand pieces on the table in front of you.</p><p>Having said that, while it's a complicated model the instructions are excellent so anyone with some experience building larger sets (like Star Wars UCS, Modular buildings or Diagon Alley) should be able to build this camper van.</p><p></p>
<h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">Parts</h4><p></p><p>With over 1300 parts it's impossible to mention them all here; obviously there's a lot of red and white including red plate and brick hinges. The seats are covered in dark red and medium blue tiles and there is some tan in the interior. There are a few parts worth highlighting:</p><p>The curtains are made of fabric and while I had my reservations about this when I first heard about the set they do look the part. There is another piece of fabric for the extending roof.</p><p>There are a few stickers; the number plates, the mirror, the VW logo, the T-shirt and the windscreen and rear window. More on them later.</p><p>There's a present from the designer: two transparent headlight bricks are used in a completely invisible spot in the engine. Keep two grey or black headlight bricks handy when you build the van ;-)</p><p>In fairness though, who cares about the parts in the set? Nobody is going to buy this as a parts pack: this is a set to build and display for a long time.</p><p></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p></p><p>The finished product is just beautiful. The red and white colour scheme is both historically correct and striking. The black stripe works as an accent between the colours and also helps to create the characteristic V on the front.</p><p>There are so many details I won't mention them all here. All the doors open to show the interior and you can take the roof off for a better view.</p><p>As I said in the title nothing is perfect. There are a few details that let the side down.</p><p>There are stickers in the set but for some reason the speedo is represented with the familiar round clock tile. Why couldn't that be a sticker of an accurate speedo?</p><p>There is a sticker for the split windscreen and two more for the back window. These are transparent stickers the size of the panel they go on. Or at least, nearly. There's no need for them to be as wide as the panel because all they do is 'paint' a 2mm wide stripe. The sticker however is not as tall as the panel, leaving a little gap.</p><p>I don't think those stickers are necessary on the rear window and I wonder if there really wasn't an alternative for the windscreen. Still, if you're doing it with sticker then at least make them big enough.</p><p>The sticker on the T-shirt says ""Make Lego models not war"". I'm sure that's correct according to the official guidelines for the use of the word Lego, but I would have preferred ""Make Lego not war"".</p>The air vents at the back are done with ladders. I wonder if grille bricks wouldn't look better.<p></p><p>But those are tiny details. They don't take away from the overall look and the abundance of details.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is obviously a model to display and with over 1300 parts for €99,99 it's pretty good value too. You could play with it although it's not easy to ride on the living room carpet with no steering and wheels fixed on axles.</p><p>Whether you like Lego, Volkswagens or cars in general, this set is a must have. It's definitely one of the best ever Lego sets in my books.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"aldredd","2014-06-17T08:50:34.53Z","A fantastic build experience","<p>I&#39;m usually more of a Technics builder. I like complexity and moving parts. I was bought this set as a fathers day gift. I did wonder at one point if this was going to be a &#39;bit simple&#39;, more like a City set - but was that really tlhe case?...</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>Instructions came in two parts. I think it would have been nice to see some proper bound instructions for this model, but it was the standard type, but did come in a plastic bag with card backing, which I&#39;ve seen a couple of times and is a welcome move.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The first thing that truck me was the huge variety in parts - over 230 unique parts in this set. Most are pretty standard though. One annoyance for me was that there was no logic at all to the packing of the pieces. I&#39;d become accustomed to bags being numbered, at least into &#39;stages&#39;, but that wasn&#39;t the case here. No problem, I&#39;ll work it &#39;old school&#39; and open a bag on demand. But by step 10 you&#39;ll have opened every bag in the box. It gets worse - you&#39;ll find the same piece in more that 1 bag, even though there are only a few of that piece. Doesn&#39;t take away from the build experience, but does make it take a little longer to find parts - and more than once I had the dreaded &#39;I&#39;m missing a part&#39; thought, when it was just in a different bag from last time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is intricate and detailed. I did it over 2 evenings, so there&#39;s good &#39;build time value&#39; in this set. Because there&#39;s a lot more detail on the inside than is sometimes apparent from the online images, it&#39;s actually a far more detailed set than I was expecting. The box suggests this is a 16+ set. I would say a 13+ year old with some previous experience will be fine with this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set is absolutely for display, not play. Which is a bit of a shame - it would have been nice to see working steering, for example, but the set looks incredible&nbsp;and is truly unmistakable - a real&nbsp;testament to the skill of the designers at Lego</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Whilst not &#39;fantastic&#39; value on the face of it, this is an enjoyable build which leaves you with a fantastic looking model - even without applying the stickers (I don&#39;t like applying stickers!). It&#39;s not a play thing, but something to build and admire - and a pleasant change from technic sets for me.</p>

"darthdc","2014-03-30T20:14:33.507Z","Another classic vehicle - Lego-ised.","<p>Well, I&#39;m no fan of the VW Camper as a rule, but this is one great looking set. I picked it up from John Lewis (I didn&#39;t know that it could be bought outside Lego.com) for the RRP of &pound;79.99, and I admit that it not bad value for the price.</p>

<p>The box is quite large: approx 19&quot; x 14.5&quot; x 2.5&quot; and unusually for a Lego box, resealable in cereal box fashion. Apart from photos showing various details of the model, it also has a few (though not enough) photos of the real vehicle.</p>

<p>The instructions are divided across 2 books, which come in a plastic bag, along with the 2 small sticker sheets, and a large piece of card to keep them flat.</p>

<p>The pieces (1334 of them, plus the usual spares) comprise of mostly small pieces. The habit of making some pieces only available in certain colours is once again in play, with areas where a 2x4 plate could be used, instead having 2 2x2 plates side by side. There is one area where a 1x1 brick and a 1x2 brick are placed side by side rather than a 1x3 brick, despite the latter being used in this set.</p>

<p>One of the things that make this set special, is the fabric parts. 6 identical curtain pieces which are brightly coloured in red, green and yellow. Then there is the large orange curtain that fits around the pop up roof. All are attached to the model with 1x2 plates with bars.</p>

<p>So, while the model has no figures (the old technic figures would seem a good size), this model is purely for display purposes.</p>

<p>The build is fairly straight forward, with SNOT techniques on the window frames especially. The roof can be tricky though, especially the end sections. The pieces on the back are not held in place well, and when placing the roof on the vehicle, they can break off. The pop up roof section uses a scissor mechanism, which works well.</p>

<p>Alas, there are stickers, though not too many. All fit onto individual bricks, which is good, but the snag are those that are placed on the window pieces. You&#39;re going to get fingerprints on those pieces.</p>

<p>The hub caps (3M wide dishes) ares held in place using 2 1x1 round studs, though I thought axels with stud ends would have been the better option.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, its a good model. The one seat folds down to form part of a bed, and the table folds down too. All doors open, including the engine compartment, rear window and front windscreen. The only thing it lacks are suitcases or surfboards to place in the luggage rack.</p>

<p>Just like another reviewer, I&#39;ve converted it to right hand drive.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows the completed model on a photographic background as well as interior shots of the model on the rear. One part of the box I particularly liked was the inclusion of a photograph of the original VW Camper Van alongside shots of the model.<br></p><p>The instructions were clear, simple and easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>This set has 1332 pieces and took me around 8 hours to build over a period of 4 days. The majority of the build was relatively simple however a couple of areas proved more tricky than others. In particular the front section of the roof, which I rebuilt numerous times thinking I had gone wrong somewhere, can be rather unstable. The roof still becomes detached now when I pick the model up.&nbsp;
<h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is an absolute stunner. Everyone who has seen the build has said how accurate the model is and how they didn't realise Lego made such intricate designs. The small details such as the interior decoration and the moving roof piece make the model that much more special.<br><br>&nbsp;I'd say this model is more of a display piece than a model to play with. My younger brother (age 4) always wants to play with it however as others have mentioned it usually ends up falling apart, particularly on the roof as previously mentioned.

"Wom","2016-01-10T12:54:28.42Z","Vintage camper with sex appeal","<p>This is the set which brought a lot of people back from their dark ages. And it&#39;s also a set which Lego is producing for a very long time, without losing any interest form the public it seems. What makes this VW T1 camper so desirable?&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""	http://static.tweakers.net/ext/f/9n8CFwhn00xQ6uB7DhuWUqSd/full.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 661px;"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Lego nailed it with the vibe on the cover art. Although I normally the more sober approach with cover art, it&#39;s the background which gives the T1 room to shine. With it&#39;s nice red and white color scheme the T1 really pops out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also the displayed interior shots add the the excitement you get when seeing the box. You basically can&#39;t wait to get your hands on all the details they show off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and give a bit of a modular feeling during the build. You really construct one part of the model which you see growing in front of you.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some unique parts which come with this set. The one whch stands out for me is the orange fabric used to simulate the raised roof. They construction used is clever and the orange really stands out. The period-correct orange works like a charm in adding detail to the model.</p>

<p>Other&nbsp;parts worth mentioning are the curtains. Dripping with 70&#39;s design they really add to the charm of the T1. This to me is smart use of unique parts, as they add to the attractiveness of the set. The main parts used are the ones you already know, often being used in a smart way.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For a lot of people this is a set they bought after a long absence at&nbsp;the Lego universe. Keeping that in mind this build is a good advertisement for Lego. With little repetitiveness&nbsp;and a modular approach to building the complete camper this is an enjoyable build to say the least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior is very detailed, offering some really smart techniques for building small appliances. Combined with the more larger structure for the exterior this build offers all parts of the Lego building trade.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wow! This is really a good looking model. The distinctive&nbsp;details are captured nicely and everybody will recognize&nbsp;this model directly. With the removable roof and various doors an compartments which can be opened, there are a lot of options to display this T1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I must admit that the finished build is not very suitable for playing. The roof comes off easily and the doors are a bit hard to align one closed. People with OCD will have a hard time with adjusting the doors and the hinges used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For adult hands the interior is also a bit small, making it a bit harder to show off the folding bench and other details. But these are small remarks, considering the overall look and feel of this model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very attractive set which features one of the most iconic vehicles around. It deserves to be displayed at a nice place in your house. Playability is not that great, but the VW T1 offers more than enough to keep you entertained for a long time!</p>

"pinz","2017-12-29T23:56:46.89Z","Pure nostalgia but no fun to build","<p>The T1 a.k.a. Bully is one of the most iconic vehicles from Volkswagen. It was also a icon for the movement in the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s and has the well recognizable&nbsp;sound of the engine from VW Beetle. To get a real one in good condition or renovated is a hard, and if you find one, it is probaly&nbsp;very expensive. So the Lego-set is maybe the better choice.</p>

<p>All the design-features of this car&nbsp;are somehow included in this model, besides the sound. It models the shape of the chassis very good, also the details, like the pop-up roof or the lava-lamp and the T-shirt&nbsp;are very nice. Also a nice idea of an engine is in and the split windshield was considered.</p>

<p>It is not a model to be played with, it is definitely&nbsp;one piece (build out of 1334 lego-parts) that you will put on&nbsp;display. the designers did not any steering at all to the model, also there are no &quot;functions&quot; included, like in a modular building or a technic-set.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s why the playability is rated as a 2, because you can admire it, after you are finish building it.</p>

<p>What brings me to fact, why I only rate it at 4 stars: I opened the box, ou comes a bunch of bags and the instructions (printed). Well that&#39;s&nbsp;not unexpected, but the are not somehow logical packed. after the first 3 pages you sit in front of 1.3k parts, all bags open. I did a rough sorting and than I was searching and searching and searching after all. It has many colors and sometimes it is a bit tricky to guess the correct colors. After approx. 4 hours I was finish. I just pulled thru just to get over it. This is one thing, that a downer to me and the reason I rated the building experience only a 3.</p>

<p>I love the model, my kids love it, but this annoying mix of parts in the bags decreases the overall-rating, because&nbsp;I will for sure remember this exercise in searching, every time I see the model. I&#39;m quite sure, that this model will be a collection item for many people.</p>

"GrandInqusitor","2022-07-21T11:26:42.587Z","So few months ago I promised that I will stick to Techinc sets... So as my 5th set","<p>This VW bus kept calling me to buy it and not a single regret about it now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts:</strong></p>

<p>It was actually pretty fun I like the detail the system building gives instead of technic which is geared more towards to functionality debatable with some sets but let this be argument for different review. Plus lots of little fun details there and there. All the parts were almost new for me as this is my first system set. Of course there are some curtains&nbsp;and Cloth which are pretty unique to this build it Think. Only thing that is missing is steering.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>Man this is so awesome in aesthetics department. The colour, the shape, and all the moving parts makes this one hell of a display piece giving something extra to every room that you display in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Is it playable: Yes should you buy this a toy for a kid to play: No, there are better options for it. If it had steering it would&#39;ve been better in playability</p>

<p><strong>Value for money:</strong></p>

<p>I think this is worth it&nbsp;just looks so pretty.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Building this van made&nbsp;want to take another road trip that I had few years back with RV. I think this is a build that makes you think about camping memories and in the end you have very nice looking display piece. Recommended to all vehicle enthusiasts, camping/RV fans, adult lego fans and lego collectors.</p>
