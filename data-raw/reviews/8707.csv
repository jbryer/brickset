"The_Reviewer","2011-05-28T21:45:13.833Z","Brilliant,but overpriced","<p>&nbsp;I went to Disneyland again; as I do every month and I went to the Downtown Disney Lego store and saw this,but I was shocked to see the price:24.99! But still I got it anyway.The set is a Architecture Model of the Burj Khalifa-Dubai in the middle east,the tile plate&nbsp;you build&nbsp; it on is bigger than the other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Box is the Standard Architecture box and the Instrutions have small fast facts about the Building and a small report about it</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are dozens of small round pieces,a few stick pieces,tiles,and some studs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Simple&nbsp;,but a little complex.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Bigger than the 19.99 Architecture sets.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I live in California and I wish they would make more west coast Landmarks in California,like:The Triangle building in San Francisco,The Grithith Observatory or the one gray round&nbsp;tall Building(previosly called the first inerstate building) in Los Angeles.&nbsp; the&nbsp; only ""real"" bad thing is the price,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note to readers:I do not know how to use paragrah thing on the review template;so sorry if it is hard to read. and sorry if my spelling or puncuation is wrong). -Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,1,2
"chree55","2011-06-13T19:52:14.19Z","The Tallest in the World...","<p>My interest in the Burj Khalifa goes way back.&nbsp;Even though I'm&nbsp;not an architect, I&nbsp;had a great appreciation for its design and aesthetics.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was really looking forward to this set. I had a fantasy that it would be the largest&nbsp;and tallest of the series... and well... one out of two ain't bad.&nbsp;When I finally saw the leaked images of this set, I gota admit, I was a little disappointed at its scale. But that would not&nbsp;discourage me. I had a few other qualms with the design, but we'll get into that.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Like the rest of the Architecture series, the boxes and instruction booklets are nicer. This is the first set that I've noticed in the Architecture series that conforms to Lego's new ""low waste"" box dimensions. Even though the set is bigger than most of the others, it's packaging is noticably smaller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>In the Farnsworth House, it was 1x1 white tiles. Here? 1x1 Medium Gray cylinders reign supreme, and constitue more than half of the total piece count. It's also rich with 2x2 tiles and flagpoles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very monocromatic, much like the rest of the series. Everything except for the base is gray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth noting that based on the price per piece, this is one of the more valuable sets in the whole Architecture series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Onward and upward! Even at a VERY small scale, this set feels tall. Building it feels repetitive, thanks to those 1x1 cylinders, but I did enjoy the sense of ""reaching new heights"" with each step. Adam Reed Tucker tends to use a lot of building techniques that don't find their way into typical sets, this one was pretty basic, but fun all the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Like the rest of the series, the model is instantly recognizable. It's attractive and, thanks to its height,&nbsp;noticeable.&nbsp;The flagpoles are meant to add structural stability to the individual columns, and the result is a very sturdy design. It now prouldy sits next to my Landmark series sets on my desk at work. It's only been here less than a day and already a couple people have come by to start trading factoids on the actual building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously there's almost nothing playable about it. It's a display piece. But by now, I think anyone who has been collecting the Architecture series knows to expect that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>When this set was first announced, I wanted it to be huge. I personally felt that the only way to honor the tallest building in the world would have been to create something that really felt as if it towered over all things Lego. Obviously, this set falls short of that. Inspired by my need for something taller, I've spent the last month designing my own rendition of the Burj Khalifa at a larger scale (approx 4&nbsp;times taller than this set). So I come at this with what I feel is a first hand perspective. The most important thing I've learned since I started my own architectural recreations is this: sometimes you have to sacrifice detail for completeness-in-design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its proportions maintain the sense of height very well, which is what's most important for this particular model. However, the way it does that sacrificed a lot of detail. The 3 dimensions which have to be maintained in the Burj are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) total height</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) width of&nbsp;each of the 3&nbsp;wings</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) length of each wing, made up by the size of the columns</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Tucker stuck with 1x1 bricks to define the width of the wings and the size of the columns.&nbsp;In Lego, once you've&nbsp;gone down to&nbsp;1x1, you really can't take it any smaller. To maintain the shape&nbsp;(tall and relatively skinny), the essence of the Burj, one column per wing was sacrificed. While the actual structure has 4 main columns on each wing, this model only has 3. I gotta admit, that bugs me a lot, but I understand why he did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another nit-picky criticism: on the actual building, the height at which these columns stop growing around the building proceed clockwise. In this Lego&nbsp;model, this happens in a counter-clockwise direction. Not something your average Lego shopper would notice, but still a detail that bugged the perfectionist in me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides that, I am still very happy that I made this purchase consider it the best of the Landmark series. I hope to see more buildings from around the world chosen in the future... this was a great way to start!</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,2,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is really small compared to the ESB, SSN, W/ST and others. There isn't much to say about the front of the box except there is a graphic picture of the set acting as a paper- weight(LEGO abuse) holding a few blueprints. The right side has an ""exploded"" view of the model so you can know how scared you can be while building the set.The left side has a regular picture of the set and Adam Reed Tucker's signature.<br><br>The back of the box has a picture of the real thing withe facts about it in up to 3 languages! It also has some weird flower(?) and a picture with the dimensions of the set living in the shadow of the facts. The box opens from the side like all Architecture sets, aiming for you not to damage the box.<br><br>The instructions are high quality, except for the fact they are stapled. Not much else to say, really.<br><h4>Parts</h4>When you open the box, you find a whole polybag of Grade A stainless steel LEGO oatmeal (112 light bley 1x1 cylinders). There is only one piece in the whole set that does not come in at least two of : a 2x2 white plate. There is also the exclusive 1x8 tile in black with the name of the building printed on it.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>NONE. It would be way awkward and off-scale unless it was S3 Gorilla Suit Guy as King Kong traveling the globe.<br></p><h4>The Build</h4>It was enjoyable, not the best unless you like your Architecture sets falling apart into poles while you are building them. Again, not much else to say about the build. But at least if you don't have enough time to build, the building's flexible(the top of the set really is and that was a pun)!<br><h4>The Completed Model</h4>The set stands proudly anywhere, as long as it's in a space that's cubic enough to not have any thing around it, except the stand(that, at least won't easily break compared to the rest of the set). It's really cool when built, especially if you've seen the building in real life. Anything on the top breaks off real easily though :(.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, it's a really cool set and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Architecture. If not, it's also really useful if you're trying to make a black-and-white bowl of oatmeal. If you can overlook the non-sturdiness, it's a great set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,2,5
"smackfu","2012-01-13T14:56:14.87Z","A tedious and wobbly","<p>A bit tedious of a build, but it's not like that is unexpected after looking at the box. &nbsp;And it's not that big a set, so that's not a big deal.</p><p>The end result looks nice, and is fairly representative of the building. &nbsp;The silhouette is right, and the curves and glass just aren't something you are going to be able to get into a LEGO model at this kind of scale.</p><p>My one complaint is that there is only one cross-tie between the columns, halfway up, that holds them square. &nbsp;Everything above that is just a pile of round cylinders. &nbsp;Brush the model and one stack will get knocked a bit askew and the whole thing looks a little off. &nbsp;That's if you didn't just knock an entire column off. &nbsp;This has happened a couple of times and I had to move the model off of my desk because of it. &nbsp;I would ideally have liked each column to be tied into the stack at the top and bottom, then it would be much more solid and the only loose one would have been the top of the tower.</p>",TRUE,4,1,4,1,3
