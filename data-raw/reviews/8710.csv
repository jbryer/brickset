I want to like and get into Heroica, but it seems to come down too I'm not the target audience in this case.<br><br>I greatly appreciate the idea of a game series that has expansions to it and can be rebuilt a few different ways. It reminds me a lot of a board game called Hero Quest and the expansions it had for it or Heroscape, again, the same thing.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art to this game is really good, I've kept it for storage along with the instructions should I ever change my mind regarding this game and want to keep it all together. <br></p><p>There are two different sets of instructions. One for building the game board with clear step-by-step pictures and numbers like regular LEGO sets. The other instructions are for the game itself and those are fairly well straight forward and game objectives on how to win.<br></p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4>Partswise, there are a total of 101 pieces with this set. Which if this were a regular set, I'd be a bit upset at the piece count to price ratio. But this is also a game that's being paid for with specialized pieces for it in the way of the dice and mini-minifigures.<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The mini-minifigures or play pieces of Heroica overall have a great appeal. In the face of a lack of babies in a LEGO City, these make for great toddler and baby pieces or building a set to a smaller scale than normal.</p><p>Overall, there are 8 of these figures, five of which are goblins and I can see some design and MOC builds with these.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The end result of any build is for the game board and you get a good micro scale representation of waterfalls and a bay with a boat waiting at the docks. It does the purpose and job it's supposed to. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I stated before, this was a gift, so I wasn't going to turn it down and accepted it into my collection with most of the pieces in the parts bin. If you're into the Heroica line of LEGO games, this is decent enough to pick up if you're trying to get everything. The only real negative is the price of the game for it's piece count, but the real purpose is also going for getting the game rules to play, not just pieces. So that seems to balance out.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-03T16:42:20.723Z","The Age of Heroes","<p>Set #3857 Draida (Bay): It has taken me a considerable amount of time and careful thinking before taking my first steps into reviewing this LEGO Game, unlike Ganrash there is quite a bit more to discuss here. However I did not purchase this item for the Game itself, but rather the opportunity to build a massive Heroica Display with all of the sets. I enjoy a good microsized display as well as any game.</p>
<p>That being said I find myself quite impressed by this attempt at LEGO to branch out into other fields, the instructions on how to play are simple enough to follow and even simpler to modify depending on how many sets of Heroica you possess. Though I have yet to find anyone to play with, I feel the quick pace of the game will allow for many to find enjoyment out of it for an endless amount of time. Its pick up and play nature reminds me of classic arcade titles, not as complicated as other role playing style games. LEGO has really done a great job with the Heroica line and I hope that it will not fade. The larger the playing board the greater the adventures.</p>
<p>You build the die and the board in several small steps, then connect all of the boards together. Also included in the game is the new crowbar piece to help disassemble the dice when you're finished with it. There are five Goblin Warrior Microfigs, a Barbarian a Wizard/Mage and a Goblin Leader. Plus one of the gold jewel pieces first introduced back during the Aquazone era of LEGO. (Only it was silver chrome back then.)</p>
<p>I'm very impressed at how they mimic the features of an RPG with the small bars and cylindrical pieces in red for the HP or Health Points of each Microfigure. The die is also quite impressive, and it bounces quite a bit when you roll it. In fact you might even be tempted to just toss it around and see where it ends up, it's just that fun to goof around with.</p>
<p>The box is great for storing the game when not in use, it is not too large and not too small, perfect for keeping all your pieces inside without losing any. And the design is extremely impressive looking, it draws your eye on the shelf at the store and continues to do so once you get it home. Overall I'd have to say, while I haven't experienced the gameplay yet I think this game is a quick bit of fun that anyone can enjoy when they feel the urge to tackle a micro-sized adventure. There's a lot to offer here once you have some of the larger boxes of Heroica games to expand upon the play pattern as well, I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of roleplaying and wishes to pass it on to their children. May your journey into the realm of Heroica be a fun one.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4

The figures are a barbarian, wisard,troll general and monsters 5 of them. This is a good game and I recommend you buy it.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
"yeti79","2012-11-30T21:19:42.12Z","Good start into the world of Heroica","<p>Draida Bay is a good start for those who might be interested in Heroica.  It is not very costly (got mine for $7)&nbsp; The game is pretty simple roll the dice move your hero, attempt to defeat the&nbsp;monsters and collect the treasure.&nbsp;The monsters include 5 goblins and the goblin general.&nbsp; The heros included are the barbarian and sorcerer.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Low price</li><li>Includes a poster of how the sets connect</li><li>Comic to read </li><li>Crowbar tool to seperate the pieces</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Crystal of Deflection rules not included in the instructions</li><li>Hero packs are a scaled down version&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;other Heroica sets</li><li>A short game by itself really meant to be combined with the other Heroica sets</li></ul><p>Draida Bay is a fun and easy game.&nbsp; If you like it I would suggest getting the other Heroica games.&nbsp; I got it because it seemed a bit like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and ended up getting the others afterwards. I play Heroica with my family from 5 year old son to Grandma.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
