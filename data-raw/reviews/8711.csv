One of the first impressions I had when I finished building the game board was its small size. &nbsp;It measures a little over 1 square foot when assembled. &nbsp;I did not find that the size was a negative though as it allows more room to expand and combine the other sets while not needing a huge table. &nbsp;The only complaint I had with the construction was the small transparent blue dish shapes that represent magic spots on the tiles are a pain to remove, even with the provided ""crowbar"" tool. &nbsp;There are no stickers. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Game Play:</b></div><div><br></div><div>Game play is fairly straight forward. &nbsp;The instructions come with two pre-made ""missions"" that have a specific game board layout including monster and item locations. &nbsp;In the normal version, game play lasts about 10-15 minutes and each player controls a hero and the monsters are static and not controlled by anyone. &nbsp;Each hero has either a melee or ranged special power and four hit points. &nbsp;Game play involved rolling the provided dice for movement and attacks. &nbsp;The dice has a shield icon on it that when rolled allows Heroes to use their special powers depending on the phase its rolled in. &nbsp;If rolled during movement, Heroes can activate ranged powers, if rolled during combat, Heroes can activate melee powers. &nbsp;Rolling the dice for movement allows the player to move 1-3 spaces, four if the shield is rolled (this can be done instead of using a ranged power). &nbsp;After movement, if you are adjacent to an enemy you MUST attack them. &nbsp;Rolling the dice for attack determines if you defeat the monster and/or how much damage you take, all in one roll. &nbsp;Monsters are all one hit point and the various types of monsters do damage ranging from 1-3 hit points to the Hero. &nbsp;The game is won when a Hero either moves into the end target space or defeats the monster on the target space. &nbsp;If your Hero lands on or moves through a chest, gold piece or potion, they pick it up. &nbsp;Opening a chest involves rolling the dice to see if and how much gold you get and if you take any damage from traps. &nbsp;Three gold can be used to buy a weapon from the store. &nbsp;The healing potion heals two HP and the strength potion defeats all adjacent monsters. &nbsp;You cannot move through the magic doors unless you roll a shield icon while adjacent or if they are moved by a Hero who has landed on a ""Magic"" spot. &nbsp;Magic spots are represented by transparent blue dish pieces placed on movement spaces. &nbsp;If a Hero ends his turn on a magic spot, they may move any magic door to a dark grey movement space. &nbsp;The game manual also details other game play options including options where a player controls the monsters and an Epic option, both which I will explore in depth at a later time. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For more updates and pictures, check out my profile for a link to my blog!</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Dash_Justice","2012-09-10T16:30:12.9Z","Neat little dungeon crawler.","The Heroica line of games caught my eye with it's theme, and overall presentation in general. Not knowing how well the game played, I decided to buy one of the medium sets. I chose Waldurk over Nathuz, but they were both on sale for $13. Let's move on.<div><br></div><div>The box is a work of art in itself, and inside awaits a quick build. Now you're ready to play.&nbsp;As a fan of more&nbsp;complicated&nbsp;board games, the gameplay was a bit of&nbsp;letdown. A few house rules can really spice things up. (I won't post mine here, as I don't think it'd be&nbsp;appropriate) A friend of mine purchased the Fortaan set. When we combined then them the gameplay&nbsp;experience&nbsp;multiplied by 10. (Not&nbsp;exaggerating) With our rules, it took a little under an hour to complete with four people. &nbsp;<h4>The Good:</h4><div><ul><li>Great parts selection, lots of 2x2 tiles with studs, and other cool bits. (Just look at the picture)</li><li>Modular and expandable! Not only can it be rearanged, but you can connect it to other Heroica sets, awesome!</li></ul><h4>The Bad:</h4></div><div><ul><li>Build is light. (if you can't tell by the picture)</li><li>Gameplay is very basic. (House rules needed)</li></ul></div><h4>The Verdict:</h4><div>As parts pack, its&nbsp;fantastic. As a game, it's also great, if you add house rules. The basic game might be great for kids, but if your looking for more of a Dungeons and Dragons type of game, did I mention house rules?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,3
