It took a short while to get into the rules, but it combines luck of the dice with skillful choice-making. And the possibilities of expansion. But I'll get back to that. First the usual list<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1: Three players (Instead of two)<br></li><li>2: Flexibility of gaming</li><li>3: The uniqueness of characters (special skills)</li><li>4: The look of it all</li><li>5: Easy to learn, and play (especially after watching the tutorial on herocia.lego.com)</li><li>6: Can be an expanded with other Heroica Games.</li><li>7: Quick games 10-15 min</li><li>8: The options of alternative gaming is quite good and opens up for one or more players in additions to the heroes.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1: There is no template for using the games treasure in the game itself (you have to make an interpretation)</li><li>2: There is no difference between the Rouge(thief)'s special ability and the Dagger's special ability. <br></li><li>3: The game-board could have been bigger<br></li></ul>
<p>As i said up front; all in all a good game. But as Lego games goes, this series has the most potential for expansion. I am already replacing the depot and treasure chest contents with custom rules. I have added merchants from the Orient Bazaar game. This will make my game more RPG-ish and expand the playing time and gaming experience. In addition, the boss has gotten extra hit points, The bridge is slippery, and you can create cave-ins. The sky is the limit, play and advance and go beyond! <br></p><p><br></p><p>Ps. looking forward to the next batch of Heroica games<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
