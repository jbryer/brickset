"18000pieces","2011-09-20T23:13:45.57Z","The Ultimate Customizable Board Game","<p>With Heroica, LEGO has finally realized in full its goal of making customizable board games. I only have Fortaan so far, but I intend to fill out my world with the other three sets. What's so good about this game that it makes me want to spend 55 more dollars on it? Let's find out!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is of the snazzy, durable sort we've come to expect from the Board Games line; it fits right in in my games closet, even if it doesn't precisely fit any of the standard board game box dimensions. Instead of the normal white we have an appealing parchment-colored background with well-put-together graphics.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are rather odd, coming in three parts; a construction manual (boring, but hey, it's a board game), a rules booklet, containing standard rules and special 'doors' rules exclusive to this set, and a poster containing a comic as well as three different configurations for the completed set. These variations are interesting, even though only the first one (shown on the box cover) provides much the in the way of interesting gameplay.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>2x2 jumper plates are in abundance. The tiny weapons are adorable, as is the helm of protection. The set is full of nice pieces like the rubbery knife in green, the tiny door/window (relatively new), the gold telescopes and cones, the LEGO die (as always), and, to my minifig-making delight, two 90 degree 1-stud brackets in brown, playing the parts of chairs. You aren't buying this for the parts unless you really want jumper plates, but it's nice that there are so many good pieces. At 304 pieces for $30, it meets the 10 parts per dollar ideal quite nicely.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The microfigures are adorable, although the Goblin King disappointingly does not look like David Bowie. Goblins are abundant, with 11 altogether, and while we get YET ANOTHER barbarian, we also get the exclusive knight in shining armor. Altogether satisfactory, with an astounding 15 total microfigs when all is added up.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's not very exciting, but what do you expect from a board game? More interesting is the way the modular nature allows for rearrangement and expansion of the original configuration.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is quite expansive when finished, and looking at it on the table you definitely feel that you got your money's worth. The micro-scale builds are adorable, and the whole thing disassembles painlessly to go in the box.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Gameplay is snappy and simple, with the only non-luck based element being your decisions about which way to go and what to do when you roll a shield, but the rules are endlessly modifiable. A collection of rules mods, including my own mod which uses the game as a tutorial for Dungeons and Dragons, is posted here:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=56244"">http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=56244</a></p><p>In the back of the instruction book it shows how this game can be snapped together with the other four to create a mega-map. I think this would add considerable depth to the gameplay, and I intend to do it soon and see how it improves on having this set alone.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I think that Heroica is the ultimate expression of the LEGO board games idea. After playing a single game you can't help but itch to improve the rules, change the board around, and fiddle with the way it works; and I think that's how LEGO games should be, the thing they were always aiming for and never quite got right until now. If you like dungeon crawls, would like to get started on dungeon crawls, or just like a fun game, pick this up. I would definitely recommend getting Fortaan first - it offers the most complete gameplay experience all by its lonesome, with enough room to breathe that you don't win before you can even learn the rules, like with what seems like the obvious starting point, Draida Bay. While fun on its own, I suspect that Fortaan will only continue to grow more and more interesting as this year's three sets and the next wave's rumored five are added to it. It gets a big thumbs up from me.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
"alexfig8","2013-08-04T01:13:07.087Z","Wow!! That's all I can say!!","<p>I picked this set up for $20 on clearance. &nbsp;For about a week, it sat in the bag, unopened, because I wasn't sure if I should keep it, or return it(it was kind of an impulse buy. &nbsp;I'm a sucker for cheap Lego :P). &nbsp;I must say, I'm glad I kept it. &nbsp;Let's get started with the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is pretty nicely done, with the microfigures playing the game. &nbsp;It is the typical games box, and features the Heroica art quite nicely. &nbsp;The instructions consist of the manuel to build it, the instructions to play, and a map type thing that shows 3 configurations for the board. &nbsp;It also has a fun little comic. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Parts are pretty good, a lot of grey 2x2 jumpers. &nbsp;Also a lot of small dark grey baseplates, which can be pretty useful for MOCs. &nbsp;There are a LOT of accessories and useful little parts. &nbsp;A decent parts selection.</div>
<h4>Microfigures</h4><div>You get 4 hero figures(Barbarian, Wizard, Druid and the exclusive Knight), and a lot of Goblins. &nbsp;As I am writing this on vacation and don't have access to the set, I cannot tell you exactly how many goblins. &nbsp;I believe there are around 5 regular, 3 or 4 elite goblins and 1 goblin king. &nbsp;A pretty good selection, especially the exclusive.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Pretty fast. &nbsp;It is made up of a lot of different modules, each being about 5x5. &nbsp;There are also many bridges which are 2 wide. &nbsp;These connect the room modules. &nbsp;There is a throne room, and a few outdoor modules, one of which I have created an extra rule for(more on that later)</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>A fantastic mini-castle. &nbsp;I really like some of the techniques. &nbsp;I will update this review later when I have access to the set. &nbsp;For now, that's it. &nbsp;Thank you for reading!!</p>
