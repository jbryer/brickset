<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, the actual levels are superb with literally hundreds of battle droids attacking you in lego form! It contains all the new characters from the clone wars (apart from gree who I was dissapointed about.) The game also has many new features such as massive ground battles and new jedi abilities. I recomend this game to anybody.</p>

<p>Hope this review helps!</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"itsaturkey","2011-04-02T21:15:27.817Z","The best Lego Hub to date","<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>HUB</h4>The Hub is where you start. Lego has outdone themselves with the Clone Wars Hub. Because it is SO big, I'm going to break each room separately.<br><br>Clone Ship Bridge:<br>You start in the bridge of a Clone Ship (I forget the name) in front of you there is a mission control panel, where you can select what mission you want to do, I'll explain it later. There are a number of things you can do here, but most importantly you can take an elevator down to the main room.<br><br>Main Room/Engine room:<br>This room is massive, even more stuff you can smash here, including a purple stud.<br><br>Med Bay:<br>Here you can create a character of your own, although it has less options then the previous games, it still holds lots of fun.<br><br>MiniKit Room:<br>Unlike previous Lego games, when you collect minikits, they build a 'classic' Star Wars character. Each one is held in a blue container. <br><br>Prisoner Cell:<br>As you progress in the campaign, evil separatist appear in the ship's jail, they can be bought but it takes some time.<br><br>Gold Brick Hanger/Turret Room<br>In the middle of the room, a pile of gold bricks sits waiting to be built. 130 gold bricks must be earned before building. The Turret room is more of a recreation center. Here a ping-pong table and boxing dummy wait. you can also hop in one of the two turret's and blast away at enemy ships.<br><br>Hanger:<br>Two hangers hold both Mission selects and vehicle selects. One holds flying ships, the other holds vehicles such as AT-TE's<br>There is another Hub, but I'll let you discover that out for yourselves. I focused on the Hub because I feel that the Hub is one of the best parts of the game. The game style is a mix of Indy and the older star wars's. Characters you buy are now walking around waiting to be bought, and red bricks are hidden around the hubs. I hope i gave you some insight on the game.<br><br>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
