Shaky and a bit frustrating.","<p><strong>LEGO Star Wars 3 The Clone Wars:</strong> Traveller&rsquo;s Tales has released many LEGO games by this point which follow similar game engine design with similar goals and puzzles. They have focused on mostly licensed Themes, in fact there are very few titles that are not based on a licensed Theme.</p>

<p>The Clone Wars changed what TT offers through their LEGO Star Wars titles, it introduced many new elements some of which I found to be rather frustrating even as an adult game player because the elements were not as intuitive as they should or could have been.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break down each feature of the title and every aspect that is featured in this game:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First and foremost the main storyline of the game follows Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of The Clone Wars, I believe the feature film was also featured during the Asajj Ventress stages. This means that many of the stages are more self-contained as the events of the series do not follow a set timeline of events. The very nature of the series has been that some episodes take place before others, after even more storylines from future seasons not in this game and as such there is a less linear pathway to follow with this game.</p>

<p>The game play of the main stages are pretty much the same as past games; however the stages introduce a few new elements on top of what is typically found. First there is True Jedi Status, collect studs to fill the yellow bar and earn a Gold Brick. Destroy everything to collect LEGO studs, certain destructible items are also part of puzzles that unlock Mini-Kits. Each stage has ten Mini-Kit canisters, instead of unlocking micro-build starships they unlock more characters this time found in the hub world.</p>

<p>New elements introduced in the main levels of these games are gold destructible objects that can only be blown up with rapid fire weapons. Silver items return that are blown up by Bounty Hunters, only this time they&rsquo;ve introduced other weapons that destroy silver objects. Jedi can now throw their lightsabers at targets, the Wii version has you target with the Wiimote and then you press the attack button to hurl it. They also can use certain spots to cut open walls or other materials to progress through the stage or deal with puzzle elements.</p>

<p>The force ability is really frustrating in this game, a lot like the magic skills in Harry Potter the game has a hard time recognizing remote movements. This may be a problem with the sensitivity of the hardware, however I also think that there should be a button to press to use the force without gesture controls as it is a bit annoying to be so precise with manipulating puzzle elements to get them to work.</p>

<p>Traveller&rsquo;s Tales has also introduced the concept of Ground Battles, these are large open area sections of levels where the objective is to build troop deployment bases and destroy enemy controlled bases in order to reach certain stage objectives. In the main game these levels, once you understand what to do, are not too terrible. They can take a while, but they aren&rsquo;t a problem. It&rsquo;s the timed missions specifically aimed at collecting 1 of the 130 Gold Bricks to collect in this game that I took serious issue with. The timed Republic and Separatist Assault missions can be very frustrating until you unlock the Invincibility cheat as the placement of the vehicles you start out with can be a pain to get back to quickly when they are destroyed by the enemy.</p>

<p>Even then they have the potential of being destroyed, sometimes when you abandon them to shut down forceshield generators, others just by stupid glitches that somehow cause the vehicle to be destroyed. These stages don&rsquo;t offer any insight into completing the levels quickly and they often place you in a far corner away from your objective, many of the larger vehicles move so slowly that getting to the objective becomes an issue.&nbsp; Especially when there are several smaller objectives and a lot of stuff going on onscreen to deal with. Also you need to unlock the ground based vehicles before you can select them for use in the missions without capturing your enemy bases and building a vehicle dispensing base of your own. (Which takes even more time away from the timed missions.) The default vehicle you get is a BARC Speeder for Republic and STAP for Separatists.</p>

<p>Overall the Ground Battles are an interesting concept to introduce, especially as the engine for the Wii allows for massive amounts of characters being on screen without causing too many glitches, or being adversely affected. However the execution of the timed missions is unfortunately a bit frustrating and hasn&rsquo;t been planned out very well. They are a bit too challenging for younger players, and even much older players may get frustrated with them playing without the invincibility cheat on. Once you have a winning strategy it goes by much quicker and with more fun, unfortunately if you don&rsquo;t play often enough you&rsquo;ll be frustrated a lot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The space missions are even more of a crapshoot, they&rsquo;re necessary for collecting the 130 gold bricks in the game, however they can be just as frustrating as the ground battles at time because of their time limits. Also you need certain vehicles to unlock some of them, and others require the system to either be controlled by the Republic or the Separatists. And the game doesn&rsquo;t exactly tell you this, there are no messages that pop up to let you know if the space mission is available while one or the other group has control of the sector. So it&rsquo;s just trial and error.</p>

<p>However you need to have one group control the entire sector system in order to fight in one last mission for both sides, so you&rsquo;ll be playing those frustrating ground missions over and over again to switch sides often unless you make sure you tackle each quest in order and avoid repeating stages too often.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly everything in this title was extremely ambitious, it introduced a ton of new features that were kind of hit or miss. And in my opinion, Traveler&rsquo;s Tales should have either focused more on making the features slightly more intuitive with more tutorials or just introduced one or two minor new features to the gameplay without overloading everything. Of course there might just be a tutorial mode that explains it all that I didn&rsquo;t check out or find. Still I think the game&rsquo;s ambition was a good idea it just could have been executed better for the players of the game. I&rsquo;d still recommend picking this one up if you can find it at a good price, just be aware that it isn&rsquo;t as simple as past LEGO Star Wars games and features can be a bit more difficult for younger players compared to past entrants in the series.</p>
