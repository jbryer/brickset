I got this the other day finally and it has been hard to put it down. There is so much to do! I never realised that there were so many characters, red bricks and levels in it! If I had to list a con, it would have to be the fact that the flying levels are a bit obscure, the arrows point to a place you can land but it doesn't show up to clearly when you need to land. Anyway, the ground battles are brilliant! You have to use different tactics to win the battles, do you want troops to follow you and attack something, build a turret or summon speeders etc.. The new features are great. Some of them are;</div><div>Lightsaber slicing</div><div>Troop Control</div><div>Lightsaber throw</div><div>2 people can be the same custom character at the same time and so much more! One great one is the ability to fly a ship into an enemy cruiser! You can attack the enemies and buy them like it Lego Indy 2, but the downside to that is if you go to an enemy ship, they open fire on you. Both sides. Instead of looking around for the character you want to be you just walk to a holo-projector board and you can choose who you are!</div><div><br></div><div>Summary:</div><div>This game is amazing, really happy with the purchase, if you haven't already, i would definitely recommend you buy it! 5/5!</div>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"Caramel","2011-08-01T09:42:07.857Z","one of the best games yet!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;bought this game a couple of months ago and finnaly finnished it. This game has many more features and more interesting stuff to do then the previous lego star wars games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To start of the story levels are amazing. They combine basic, space and ground battles to form an excellent array of levels. The story starts of with a prolouge, the geonosian arena which unlike the original star wars games actually has the monsters. Then the story splits in three paths. Dooku story, ventress story and grievous story. Once all of those are completed you unlock the epilouge, the zillo beast. There are also two secret levels, the palace of doom and hostage crises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on to character abilities. First of there are three new clone weapons. The rapid fire machine gun, the rocket launcher and the EMP grenades which stun droids. Next is new electrocution switches which can only be unlocked by magna gaurds and Robonino. There are also new jedi/sith moves, anyone with the force can use force circles, which are jedi symbols that appear on the ground and allow you to cut open walls or damage bosses or giant vehicles. There is also gold lego which must be destroyed by a rapid fire weapon, like a machine gun or a super battle droid. Finally there are sniper rifle characters, which can zoom in on people and instantly kill them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is space and space vehicles. There is a new feature called multi-level space missions which in these you can attach to a hyper drive ring and go up or down a section to get to other parts of captital ships. You can also land and do stuff on the ground then get back in your ship and countinue flying. There are now different kinds of ships. Rapid fire which can break gold lego.&nbsp;Missle fireing which can break silver lego. Torpedo firing which has infinite torpedos. And sepratist ship which can destroy dark side lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for my favourite things ground battles. There is always a main objective in ground battles. It will be either destroy all enemy items, destroy the enemys command center, build an escape pod, destroy statues or collect studs. They are all basicly the same seeing as you have to destroy things. As you get more bases you move up in what you can build. You go cannons, small vehicles, troopers, silver and gold destoying vehicles, shield generators, ray shields, torpedo generators and finally escape pods minikit dispensers or stud dispensers. If you are controlling certain characters you can controls sqaudrons of clones/battle droids which allow you to take down bases quicker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the hub/minikits. There are actually two hubs in this game. The republic cruiser and the invisble hand. On the republic cruiser you can by republic vehicles, ships and characters, create characters, build the gold brick model and free sepratist prisoners to buy them and free minikits which i will talk about later. In the sepratist ship you can unlock bonus levels, buy sepratist ships, vehicles and characters, and complete the bounty hunter missions. There is also a section of space which is used for bonus space missions. There is one bonus&nbsp;space mission per planet and they involve collecting money in a variety of ways. The minikits are actually classic characters from episodes 1,4,5 the force unleashed and 6 once completed you can free them and buy them to play as.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats my review if you get the chance buy this game you will not regret it.</p>",TRUE,5,1,2,5,5
