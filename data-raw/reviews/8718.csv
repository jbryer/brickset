This can sometimes be a pain because you have to align your character just right.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">*</span>There isn't a level builder like the previous LEGO games.&nbsp; I suppose the absence of this was to make room for the fantastic ground battles feature.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">*</span>Cape elements seem to be absent from character creation.<br><br><br>Overall, I found this game to be very fun to play, minus the glitch.&nbsp; If you're a LEGO fan or a Star Wars fan or a combination of both, I think you'll enjoy this game.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>",TRUE,4,1,2,5,5
"deadtree103","2011-06-17T15:27:05.07Z","Another entry into the ever increasing ranks of the Lego games.","<p>So i bought this from TRU a little while ago for about 30 bucks. It carries over many elements from LHP, but takes a few steps back due to removing a main shop where you'd buy everything at. Instead the Characters and red Bricks are found throughout the Hubs, whereas the ground and Space vehicles are purchased via small terminals(seperatist on the seperatist ship, republic on the republic ship). This is most definitely an inconvenience, as you have to search all over both ships to find the characters and red bricks you're looking for. LHP was leaning towards this, what with having to find character tokens and red bricks around the hub/levels, but it all was available for purchase in diagon alley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gameplay is mostly the same as past Lego games, possibly better, due to the Jedi having more abilities, a very welcome part is that you can no longer be interruped while using the force or building(you're essentially invulnerable while doing that). But My main problem with it is that there's A LOT more combat than in past Lego Games, and even more areas with constantly respawning enemies. combat has NEVER been the strongest point of the lego games, so having it more pronounced is a very bad idea. I play Lego games mainly for the platforming and puzzle-solving, not the combat(I don't mind it when it's in reasonable amounts though). Another thing is that, if you're a seperatist On the Republic hub, everyone in sight will try and kill you. The reverse has the same result. This is TERRIBLY annoying, since you WILL die multiple times. This is much more obvious in the cell-block area of the Republic ship, in order to unlock the cells to buy the characters inside(Which are villians)you have to use seperatist Characters. And If you can somehow unlock them with republic characters, the inhabitants will try and kill you and the Surrounding republic characters will insta-kill the villian, it's a no-win situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ground battles are good, but they definitely have their flaws. Since Silver and gold objects can only be destroyed by Explosives(not a change, it's been like that since the beginning)&nbsp;and rapid-fire weapons(respectively), I found myself running around smashing seperatist buildings, then I'd run into a silver or gold object, so i'd end up going ""oh bloody hell, time to go back to base for an AT-AP/RX-200 tank"" , Since the AT-AP can destroy silver objects, but not gold, vice-versa for the RX-200(Really, those are the only vehicles you need). something very dissapointing is that Jedi can't control troops, and if you're controlling troops and jump into a vehicle, you get removed from your troops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The character selection is solid, although the methods of obtaining them are now quite varied, you can unlock them by playing them in story levels, or by buying the characters roaming the hub worlds, or buy completing a minikit and buying it's character. My favorite new abilities are the Chaingun clones, there are a few different clones with chainguns, and there are two ways of using it: If you fire while moving, you'll keep moving and firing, if you fire while standing still, you'll go into what I like to call ""turret mode"" You'll be rooted in place and the control stick while move your line of fire, this is especially fun in the ""Rookies"" level, there's a bit you play as Hevy(one of the chaingun clones)where you are faced with an endless wave of battle droids, if you go into turret mode and just strafe them, you will destroy HUNDREDS of them, easily my favorte part of the whole game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall, yes, it has it's flaws(what game doesn't?)but it's still a damn solid experience and I heartily reccomend picking it up.</p>
