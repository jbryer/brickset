"Buckbrick","2011-04-09T05:51:11.003Z","Yet another nice Lego model of an architectural marvel","I have to credit the Fallingwater set for igniting my appreciation of architecture of&nbsp;Modern&nbsp;masters such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Courbusier and the designer of the Farnsworth House, Mies Van Der Rohe.<div><br></div><div>I own only two models from Lego's Architecture series - this and the fabulous Fallingwater - for two reasons. They are the 2 largest models in the series, and two that I found the most beautiful. I think the designer has done a great job in rendering the model given the scale, but yet retained its proportion and even included an interior complete with furnishings!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In size, the base is larger than the 16x32 of the Fallingwater. As with the other sets, it comes with an instruction book printed on premium paper. It begins with an introduction of the designer (Van Der Rohe) and the Farnsworth house. It proceeds with a very&nbsp;easy-to-follow&nbsp;(much too easy IMO, it calls out no more than 3 parts per step) building instructions. Parts variety is average with lots of 1x1 elements in white and tan.</div><div><br></div><div>This is one of those sets that is bound to have its supporters and detractors. Less parts variety and an easy build aside, I have no qualms with it at all. The end result is all that matters. I love the minimalist and clean design of the set, much like the actual house, and its beautiful and looks great on display. However, I wonder if I could have gotten the parts on bricklink for less than the asking price. In all, despite the asking price, I have no regrets buying the set and it complements well with the Fallingwater.</div><div><br></div><div>EDIT: I thought I include some images to make use of the new 'insert image' feature.</div><div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5605446906_620d21663a.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5141/5605447508_32061bf4ea.jpg[/img]</span></span></div><div><span><span><div>[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5604864813_45631a5506.jpg[/img]</div><div>[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5605448930_6515237edb.jpg[/img]</div><div>[img]http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5604865583_bd16bc5713.jpg[/img]</div></span></span></div><div>[img]http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5604865583_bd16bc5713.jpg[/img]</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,1,2
"smackfu","2013-02-22T09:28:20.023Z","Well done set, but very tedious","<p>The is the fourth Architecture set I've bought, and the largest. &nbsp;Generally the builds are tedious, the parts are not that interesting, and the prices are high. &nbsp;And sometimes the models are not that great.</p><p>While Farnsworth House does have the first three problems, at least the model is quite nice. &nbsp;The interior of the house has great detail, even though you can't really see it after you put the roof on. Some nice SNOT techiniques, and the chairs just look brilliant. &nbsp;And it's a big set that looks classy that you can put on your bookshelf at work.</p><p>Part selection? 536 pieces, 238 are the same 1x1 tile. &nbsp;Except for that piece, and the big dark green plates that make up the base, you can probably build this set out of your spare parts bin.</p><p>Tedious build? You bet! &nbsp;One step is to take a white 6x8 plate and cover it with 48 1x1 tiles. And the end result looks terrible unless you take the time after every single row to straight them up. &nbsp;(Pushing crooked tiles with the center of the short end of a 2x8 plate does a good job of lining them up with their neighbors. &nbsp;And then running the same plate back and forth over the end of the row makes sure they are all well aligned.)</p><p>This brings something else to mind: One of the traps of modern design is that there is no room for error. &nbsp;Anything that is wrong will ruin the entire effect. &nbsp;You see this same this in this Lego model of a very modern building. &nbsp;It is very hard to get everything looking perfect, and because it is supposed to be regular and aligned, your eye is immediately drawn to every imperfection. &nbsp;</p><p>High price? In my opinion, yes. &nbsp;At list price, you can almost assemble this from Pick-a-brick for less than Lego charges. &nbsp;When it drops to $35 on Amazon US, which it's done a few times, it's much more reasonable.</p><p>Conclusion? Buy on sale, be prepared for tedium. but you end up with a nice model.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,1,2
"sipes23","2013-08-19T18:09:33.633Z","A must for people who have been there","<p>I've been to the Farnsworth House and live near Chicago, so I'm layman familiar with Mies's work. And this set captures the essence of the Farnsworth House beautifully, though (for obvious reasons) skips the lovely setting the house is in.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A faithful rendition of the Farnsworth house.</li><li>Even the furniture.</li><li>And the marble tiles on the patio.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The marble tiles are rendered with 1x1 tiles. Lots of them.</li><li>They are a pain to line up nicely.</li><li>You will want to spend a few days off living in the actual house.</li></ul>
<p>Bottom line: It's gorgeous. How gorgeous? My wife allows its display in the living room.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,1,4
"Randomness","2023-04-07T19:32:14.63Z","An Unnatural Amount of Natural Lighting","<p>Like if you&#39;re trying to sleep, it seems you can see everything outside, and you&#39;d have to change in one of the two bathrooms, which I assume have actual walls, but whatever, that&#39;s not the point of this.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>They&nbsp;don&#39;t exist.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build gets quite repetitive. Once you&#39;re past building the base, you stack some plates on top of each other, and then go straight into just placing a bunch of white 1x1 tiles for an annoying amount of time. This continues past what I assume is a porch an into the actual house, where there are a lot less of that monotony, but it&#39;s still there.</p>

<p>The brick yellow center is the most interesting part of&nbsp;building, and the building of the chairs is not too bad, although you know it&#39;s going to bea struggles to get the pips off later. The tables are a little bit annoying to align, if you&#39;re looking for perfection, as they&#39;re just bases of translucent 1x1s and either a brown 1x1 or brown 1x2 tile, either of which are an affront to OCD to try and get perfect.</p>

<p>The roof is another monotony, although it&#39;s with 2x2 tiles, so it&#39;s not as bad.</p>

<p>After finishing it, though, it actually looks really nice. The build may not be super fun, but the end result is worth it, I think.</p>

<h3>Price &amp; Pieces</h3>

<p>The only piece in the set that is rare or exclusive is the actual sign that says Farnsworth House, which is disappointing. The biggest window pieces are a bit rare, but not so bad, and not so worth it.</p>

<p>The Price per Piece is&nbsp;not worth it, at 9.1 pieces per dollar/9.9 pieces per pound, which then and now, is not worth it at all.</p>

<p>The pieces do not help this set at all.</p>

<h3><strong><em>El fin</em></strong></h3>

<p>So this set, while looking very cool, doesn&#39;t really make it. It&#39;s not super worth it. It&#39;s a great display piece, sure, but the price isn&#39;t worth it, the build isn&#39;t worth it, and unless you really want it, it&#39;s not worth the 250 dollars of today.</p>

<p>Only get it if you desire it very much.</p>
