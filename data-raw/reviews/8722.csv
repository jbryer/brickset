"fikko3107","2012-12-11T01:47:50.76Z","Neat little set","<p>This is a nice little set which I get for a decent price while my dad was on a business trip to Hong Kong (The eastern LEGO paradise, if only you know where to look.) along with the Agent's River Heist and City's 2010 Police buggy. So on to the review...<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The Packaging is a polybag, the regular sized polybag.It pictures Jake Raines riding on his small ""Desert Glider"" with the uniform desert background that is also seen in other Pharaoh quest sets. The instructions is in the style that usually came with the Polybags and Impulse sets, which is a folded one. personally, I feel that the folds makes it easier to tear. It's a very linear, nine-steps instructions that like other of its kin, advertises the other sets in the line.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4>The parts are what every good polybags should contain: good parts. It contained a 3-bladed rotor piece and a one sided bearing plate. It also contains a skateboard wheel, used with another interesting element which I believe have previously been used to make planes in City sets. You get six, Neat dark red pieces, 1x2 and 1x4 plates, 3 of each. A transparent brown glass/wall element is also included. You also get a black mini-rudder. A spare gun and aviator goggles are given which can't be a bad thing. We also get studs (Yawn...) and some nice wing elements in grey. Also included is a 2x6 black plate.We also get a Jumper plate with an antenna.(as a joystick controller;the antenna have recently seen much use as one. Last but not least you get a couple of binoculars and a piece I can't quite describe, although LEGO officially call this set as ""Plates with Bows 2x2""
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Since it's a polybag, you can't expect more than 1 minifigure. But it is a good one; We get Jake Raines in his Aviator Jacket, the rarer of the two variants of Jake Raines.The torso he uses is exclusive to this fig. It's got a zipper, hints of a white undershirt, a couple of pockets with a printing of what looks like a badge and a bald eagle. another Badge with an ""S"" in it is present. there is also what looks like a name tag with absolutely ineligible writing. at the bottom is the edges of his Jacket. His back continues the Jacket edge and has a print of a white eagle over a red background, beneath which is the writing SMH. I have no idea what this means. Jake's legs are&nbsp; plain tan,just like his other, commoner variant he also uses the same goateed, light bearded, sideburned head that his other variant uses, Showing of his confident smile. It's a single sided head, by the way. Completing the figure is a reddish-brown (remember:Reddish-brown. not the same color like the CMF series 3 pilot's Dark brown helmet.) with the regular grey goggles and a standard revolver introduced in the western theme.
<h4>The build</h4>It's a polybag model, so the instructions are very linear, as it should be. you put the Tail fin on the black plate, the red plates here and there, the jumper, the bearing, more red plates, add wings, give detail put the plate with the bows, add propeller, add wheels, add glass, give a rudder and we're done. An incredibly simple yet fun build.
<h4>The completed model</h4>When we're done, we get a surprisingly nice looking albeit slightly blocky-looking front. I find the model very swooshable. Jake looks a bit too big on the vehicle, like lots of City police sets. The binoculars served it's purpose well as retro machine guns. Also, a complaint, If you remove Jake it is quite likely that you take off one or both of the dark red 1x2 of the plane. Well, I guess you can't be too perfect.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Right, to summarize, The set is very good. It's not particularly rare, but not common either. So to conclude:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p>Box/Instructions: 6/10-A well done art that is quite eye catching. <br></p><p>Parts: 7/10-Good, rare-ish parts that would be useful</p><p>Minifigure: 6/10-Quite detailed and uncommon</p><p>The build : 5/10-Interesting, linear build.</p><p>The completed model: 6/10-A small toy that is pretty fun.</p><p>all in all, 6/10, a good set. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2016-06-14T17:08:53.877Z","Jake Raines Pilot.","<p><strong>Set #30090 Desert Glider:</strong> Here&rsquo;s a blast from the past, Ancient Egypt to be exact, with this polybag from Pharaoh&rsquo;s Quest we have an interesting little build. Here&rsquo;s the pros and cons and then final thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Desert Glider model is a small fun looking little vehicle with simple build, easy to make, fun to play with.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cheapest set with Jake Raines in Aviator gear.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Jake Rains Minifigure looks great. Aviator Jacket is double-sided torso print with the SMH logo printed on his back.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Price-Per-Piece Ratio was skewed upon initial release.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Difficult to find as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Glider model may not appeal to everyone, it is small, reminiscent of a similar build from LEGO Adventurers and lacks any unique parts.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Decent little companion piece to the larger Pharaoh&rsquo;s Quest sets, but easily skippable. I will admit it is much better than the other Polybag given out during this time, so there is that. At least the Minifigure is slightly more unique, Polybag lovers will collect it if they go in for every single release, casual collectors can safely skip. Children may enjoy it, depends on how they feel about small planes with only room enough for one person. Mildly recommended for younger fans if it can be found for a good deal.</p>

<p>Desert glider is my only pharaohs quest set , but it so good in many factors that it is in my top 50 sets .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The minifigure has the standard aviation helmet with dark blueish grey goggles , his face has some sideburns, a small beard , stubble and a scar , his torso has a very nice jacket print with a big logo on the back and his legs are unprinted dark tan .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>plane build is small but very effective the wings are 2&times;4 slanted plates , it has a four stud space for him to sit on and he has a lever for control , there is also a propeller and set of wheels on the front accompanied by two dark blueish grey binocular pieces .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>for a small set this is incredible for value and the play and display also exceed expectations I recommend it to any Lego fan .</p>
