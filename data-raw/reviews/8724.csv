This made building&nbsp;annoying as&nbsp;it&nbsp;fell off more than once. &nbsp;So no stormy seas for this model.",FALSE,4,3,3,3,5

Most of the parts are black but there are some Dark-Tan jumper plates. The transparent studs are good too but not uncommon.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Play Value</h4><div>The ship is simple to build and while not interesting, I doubt you will get bored as it will not take long to build. While small the ship is quite movie-accurate considering it's size.&nbsp;The play value is not fantastic as there are no other mini-scale sets in the theme to interact with but if you wanted to make your own then it would be improved. Despite this I think it makes a good display-piece especially if you display it with other PotC sets or mini-scale sets from other themes like Creator or Star Wars.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall it's probably the worst set in the theme but that's not bad as they are all at a high quality. If you are a collector I think you will like it but otherwise I would avoid the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3
