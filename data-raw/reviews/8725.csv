"legoclone999","2011-05-11T15:15:59.31Z","For the price, this is a pretty cool minifigure.","<p>I just recieved this little Jack Sparrow in the mail as a free gift for pre-ordering Lego POTC the videogame.&nbsp; It comes exactly as shown on the front of the bag:no accessories, just the minifigure. To clarify, YES, the face is the same as on the packaging (some people were wondering). The lines on the face are not as dark and are light tan colored, not black. Apparantly this is supposed to be the voodoo doll of Jack Sparrow from the new movie, and the lines are supposed to look like it was sewn together. It is a nice addition to get another Jack Sparrow hairpiece, but the rest of the parts are not the same as the normal Jack Sparrow with his his jacket on. The belt buckles are different and so is the shirt under. The set doesn't come with instructions (pretty self explanatory) but the Jack Sparrow hairpiece is packaged in it's own bag. It obviously doesn't really involve any building, but&nbsp;as long as you have some other&nbsp;potc sets or are a minifig collector, this is an okay polybag set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,5

In other words, I could not beat the price. However, I've been under the impression that this figure represents Jack Sparrow from At World's End when he is hallucinating with five Jack Sparrows. I thought this was the wooden Jack, that came out of Flying Dutchman's hull. Apparently it is some voodoo doll, though, from On Stranger Tides. That explains why it has the title line at the top of the polybag but I still feel this is more like the wood Jack than some doll, especially since it is life-sized. Anyway, totally cool with mostly unique parts except for the hair piece. The face is tan rather than flesh-colored. Definitely suggest.<br>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,5
"LEGOParadise","2011-06-09T17:03:10.807Z","Sewn Together","<p>I got my Voodo Jack Sparrow free with the&nbsp;Lego Pirates of the Carribbean (PotC) Video Game from HMV.co.uk. It is a detailed, rare minifigure. Once you open the bag, you get four pieces and no instuctions or anything else, presumably because building a minifigure is pretty self-explanatery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voodo Jack</strong></p>
<p>Now on to the main part of the set: the minifigure! The&nbsp;minifig is from PotC On Stranger Tides, and is a replica of the printed trophy piece of the Jack Sparrow Voodo doll available from the Lego PotC set Queen Anne's Revenge. </p>
<p>Every part of the minifigure is unique to this set&nbsp;except for the hair piece, which can be found in nearly every PotC set. The head is not flesh coloured,&nbsp;but tan, making it look more ""wooden"" and has curved lines and knots, just like a tree, printed on it. It also features Jack Sparrow's face but has the effect that it has been painted on.</p>
<p>Next is the torso. The wooden design continues down from the face until a dark grey collar which looks like it has been sewn on, with stitching marks. Below is Captian Jack's normall clothes underneath a dark brown coat which, like the rest of the body, have the appearance of being sewed together. The back of the torso has a dark brown coat and the back of the collar printed on.</p>
<p>Finally, the legs. The joint is decorated with the top of a scarf used as a belt and nothing else. The left leg has the bottom of Jack's dark blue clothes while the right leg has a tucked-in scarf, the same as in every other Captain Sparrow minifig's legs apart from the fact that the scarf is dotted (a sewn look).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>This is&nbsp;must-have for PotC collectors and is a great minifigure made up of mostly exclusive pieces. In the future, this will be a highly expensive collectible Lego set and now is the chance to get it! If you live in the UK, order it from HMV.co.uk and if you live in the USA, order it from Toys R Us. Thank you for taking the time to read my review!</p>

"AETerry","2011-05-20T14:19:22.39Z","Captain Jack Sparrow Minifigure Review","<p>Yeah... after seeing On Stranger Tides, I broke down and went to my local game store where I knew they still have sets of the LEGO PoTC video game with the minifigure polybag and picked it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fairly good value for something that comes free with a LEGO style game. It is indeed a minifigure of the Jack Sparrow voodoo doll from the movie. So it's not a bad mini. Those who've pulled off scoring this mini cheaper by just asking have done very well. The detail working isn't bad to show it's a voodool sewn and stiched together. He makes for a good little collector piece.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
"sharky","2011-05-18T13:40:26.42Z","I purchased this at TRU.","While looking at the&nbsp;poly-bagged&nbsp;Lego sets I found this Jack mini-fig among them. &nbsp;It was the only one among the Toy Story, Star Wars, and Ninjago poly-bag sets. &nbsp;At the time I had no clue it was a promotional item. &nbsp;Now that I'm online and have read more about it I check my&nbsp;receipt and&nbsp;I noticed they charged me $.01. &nbsp;Yes, one penny. &nbsp;I had not noticed because I bought several other items so the total on my&nbsp;receipt&nbsp;didn't seem off. &nbsp;I guess I lucked out today.<div><br></div><div>The item is not much to review.
