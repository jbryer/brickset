The minifigure has flesh coloured skin, He is wearing glasses and has his skar at the top of his head.&nbsp; His head is double sided, one side he's happy and the other he angry. His torso is the <span style="""">Gryffindor uniform and is double sided as well. His legs are just plain black. Finally he comes with a wand which is just a brown lightsaber blade. <br><br>The lab is nice, the set includes a lot of golden studs. You can lift the top of the shelve off and it reveals a hidden comparment, what you can store things in. <br>The accessories include a spider, a letter, a horn and five diffrent potion bottles.<br>The set comes in a polypacket with the harry potter logo on it.<br><br>Overall- Its a&nbsp; nice set and it was only 30p. </span><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Kevin/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot-4.png"" alt=""""><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Kevin/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot-5.png"" alt=""""><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Kevin/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot-6.png"" alt="""">

It has few pieces, a couple of oridinary potion bottles, and yet another [cape-less] Harry.</p><p>Yawn.</p><p>It's not to say that the set is awful, it is just very unnessecary to own if you have a Potion's Class-style set or countless Harry's. As if it is a tradition, there is a secret compartment to the shelf than contains a few pieces/parts that have been seen in other HP sets, especially the old ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you feel you MUST have this set, go right on ahead!

"Odeinoichus","2012-07-26T22:29:37.083Z","You're a Wizard Harry...","<p>Set # 30111 The Lab: ... which makes you special, so LEGO decided to make you available in literally almost every singly LEGO set imaginable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is basically what you're getting here folks, a small model and yet another Hogwarts Uniform Harry Potter Mini-Fig. How many of these does one collector need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I have to admit, as a fan of Harry Potter and LEGO I am a sucker for all things they've made available. So I bought this. Is it something you should own? Well the model is fairly simple and doesn't use up any unique pieces, so you could in theory build this with parts from your collection, and Harry is after all readily available in many different sets with this exact same printing and design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the only real thing this Polybag has going for it is the fact that it includes a&nbsp;printed tile mail piece&nbsp;and a black spider. Two pieces that make this item an ok one to pick up if you're looking for cheap pieces, which I'm not 100% sure you can get through LEGO's Pick-A-Brick selection, so there is that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, if you have Harry, and who doesn't, this set can easily be skipped unless you are a completeist. If you are a parent looking for something cheap to give your child to introduce them to LEGO or as an impulse buy, this really isn't too bad, in the end that's really why this set was made. For lovers of LEGO of all ages and all wage classes to be allowed to enjoy the fun that is LEGO. And for a Polybag set that's all you really can ask.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,1,2
"tkettle9719","2012-04-08T11:04:25.05Z","Potions Lab...Mini, Yet Interesting","I got this set from the Easter Bunny today. I was happy to get it, honestly, seeing as I need some part of Hogwarts other than the little doorway from the Freeing Dobby set. It's small, but it does have its features. <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-I definitely like how every potion piece is unique, in that each has a different color, or a different piece. Quite nice for any parts back. <br></li><li>-I'm also a big fan of the hidden compartment, which contains (I'm guessing) a bezoar. Necessary for any potions set. <br></li><li>-Also, the 10 gold 1x1 studs are a joyfully found, not-so-common piece. Most are used as potion corks, but it's still cool.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Another Harry fig? Why not include Professor Slughorn, or even Snivelus Snape? Some creativity, please, Lego. <br></li><li>-I sort of wish that there were more potions; there's plenty, but this set could be more colorful, more playable, with those. <br></li><li>-The spider is pointless here; however, if one has nothing better to do, then you can use Harry to point the spider off of the lab. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a nice little set. It doesn't have as much playability as a regular set, nor does it have any actual functions. However ,with the creativity of our minds, it can actually be a fun set to play around with. I recommend it, but I'd rather get the mini Hogwarts Express. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"AETerry","2013-03-15T12:28:43.427Z","The Lab Review","<p>At $3.99 for the set, this is one of those quick, cheap and easy to pick up sets you see in the aisle at Target. Or something you get free as a promotional offer. Being a fan of Harry Potter, particularly the later releases of LEGO sets, this ranked as a must get.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set comes in a polybag or plastic bag, giving you an indication of how small this set is. The instructions are on a folded sheet of paper following LEGO's styling of clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations and a small listing of all the parts that are in this set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set contains 34 pieces, of which the most note worthy are the spider pieces, the printed letter tile and the clear brick parts used for potion bottles. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You have one minifigure by way of Harry Potter, no cape.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As a small set, it is relatively easy to build and make for something easy to display on a shelf or fill out other larger Harry Potter sets.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I greatly enjoyed picking up this set, these small polybag sets are always fun to pick up, quickly build and display or get as a readily handy source of extra parts in a collection bin. For younger children, I can see this type of set that's easily something they can purchase with a little bit of saving and not have to wait for birthdays, holidays or beg parents for.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"Kooz","2013-04-10T17:43:07.203Z","Boring","<p>This set is just boring. &nbsp;It's a polybag, so you aren't expecting much, but even for a poly, it's a boring set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Polybag with a pic of the set. &nbsp;Nothing special.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few square transparent 1x1 bricks, and a few 1x1 gold round studs. &nbsp;there's also a 2x1 tile ""letter"" which is a cool piece (at least I think so).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Harry Potter. &nbsp;Meh.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Took seconds--you're building a box, essentially.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Is boring. &nbsp;I suppose it works well in conjunction with some other Harry Potter sets, but on it's own there's nothing to it. &nbsp;It is not playable, and isn't even interesting on display. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I think you only buy this is you like Harry Potter and want him in Lego form, but don't want to buy a big HP set. &nbsp;Or you get it if you're a&nbsp;completest. &nbsp;Otherwise, this is an easy pass.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,1,1
"srose_2013","2018-08-12T02:25:23.783Z","The Set that Started it All","<p>I gave this set a five-star rating because it is literally the first LEGO set I ever bought as an adult...and it made me want to buy more. I bought this because I am a Harry Potter fan and thought it was cute. Then, I got hooked. I had to have all the Harry Potter sets that were available and still do!</p>

<p>The minifigure in this set is common. It can be found in several other sets, but it is the cheapest way to obtain this particular figure. What I do love about the minifigure is the attention to detail that reflects the character from the books and movies exactly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering the size of this set, I love the lab setup! At the time of its release, I really appreciated the use of the 1x1 round plate and transparent 1x1 bricks to create the potion bottles. I also think it&#39;s cool the way the shelf lifts off to open a compartment where letters can be found.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing what else LEGO has in store for Harry Potter!</p>
