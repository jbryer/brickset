To start off I will review each set individually, then have a combined conclusion at the end.</p><p> </p><h4>LEGO SW 8085 Freeco Speeder</h4><p> </p><h4>The Minifigures:</h4><p>&nbsp;*Anakin Skywalker : Double sided head, blue torso and grey legs.</p><p>*Thi Sen                : New head/torso piece, Grey torso and legs.</p><p> </p><h4>The Build:</h4><p>&nbsp;The Build takes about half an hour, an it is a very interesting build too. The use of the parts is awesome, there is also a new element in the set as well. The finished model looks great, the new elements give it a sleek look.</p><p> </p><h4>Pros</h4><p> </p><p>* Cool new Minifigures.</p><p>* New pieces.</p><p>* Finished model looks good, and is strong.</p><p> </p><h4>Cons</h4><p> </p><p>* Stickers</p><p>* Should be 1 more minifigure-like a Clone, or another alien.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Set 7913 Clone Trooper Battle Pack</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Minifigures:</h4><p>* 2x Bomb Squad Clone Troopers--These have Orange Printing.</p><p>* 1x Clone Commander--White with Green Printing.</p><p>* 1x ARF Trooper--White.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of these minifigures are unique to the set.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>The Build:</h4><p>The Speeder is a simple build, takes 2 mins, lots of playability, and <strong>NO STICKERS.</strong></p><p>Now, on to the Pros and Cons.</p><h4>Pros</h4><p>* Unique Minifigures.</p><p>* Cool new speeder.</p><p>* <strong>NO STICKERS.</strong></p><h4>Cons</h4><p>* No one to fight, but solve that problem by buying the 7914 Mandalorian Battle Pack.</p><p>* LEGO could have included a plate for the minifigures to stand on, but they didn't. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Set 7914 Madalorian Battle Pack</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Minifigures:</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* 4x Mandalorian Troopers--New printed style. Each of these minifigures come with a Jet Pack and a newly designed Helmet. </p><p><strong><em></em></strong> </p><h4>The Speeder:&nbsp;</h4><p>Average build, Good selection of pieces, takes about 5 mins. The minifigure does fall off (or the controls break off) when you seat a minifigure on it.</p><h4>The Turret:&nbsp;</h4><p>Interesting build, a new technique used here I think, cool new piece, a rare piece, a minifigure can stand there at the controls with no difficulty, takes about 2 mins.</p><p><strong><em></em></strong> </p><p><strong>Now, on to the Pros and Cons.</strong></p><h4>Pros</h4><p>* Unique Minifigures.</p><p>* Cool new speeder.</p><p>* New turret with unique pieces.</p><p>* Rare Piece.</p><p>* <strong>NO STICKERS.</strong></p><h4>Cons</h4><p>* No one to fight, but solve that problem by buying the 7913 Clone Trooper Battle Pack.</p><p>* LEGO could have included a plate for the minifigures to stand on, but they didn't.</p><p>* It is TROUBLESOME for that minifigure to sit on the speeder! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>In Conclusion, This Product Collection is&nbsp;is definitly&nbsp;worth to buying, not only because you get the Freeco Speeder, but you get a minature&nbsp;army for each minifigure. If you are a fan of LEGO Star Wars, get it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LEGOSLUG</p><p>P.S.
