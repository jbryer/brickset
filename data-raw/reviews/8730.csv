"hewman","2011-06-15T06:06:26.397Z","Need extra ADU soldiers? This is your set","<p>I&nbsp;recently purchased several of these from bricklink to make up for what I see as the only small flaw in the Alien Conquest theme, not quite enough ADU soldiers in the sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifig:</p>
<p>The minifig is the same one that comes in the Jet-copter Encounter (7067) with the double sided printing on the head. One toothy and slightly evil grin and the other a curled eyebrow worried look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pieces:</p>
<p>The set comes with both the binoculars and the double ray-gun that is so far unique to this theme. Most of the pieces are fairly standard with the exception of the 2 x 4 dark grey tile which is new to me (although I think tiles of this size have been around for about a year or so). The colours are quite reminiscent of Classic Space with a lot of blue and grey and just a small hint of yellow.</p>
<p>A lot of people love the trans-clear visor, well I have some good news for you, not only is it in this set but you get a spare as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building:</p>
<p>The build as you would expect is fairly simple but quite clever as to how they designed stable rocket wings. The minifig wears a jet pack that dates back to the Classic Space days. You then build the rest of the rocket wings separately. The basics of it are a 2 x 4 light grey plate with two 1x2 1x4 brackets attached (if you don't know what this is, imagine a 1x2 plate with a 1x4 plate attached at a right angle). the 1x2 parts of the brackets are built onto the 2x4 light grey plate leaving room to place the wing pieces either side. This is then reinforced by placing a dark grey 2x4 tile over the top which adds a great deal of strength but is the least attractive part of the set.</p>
<p>Put on some trans-orange cones and this is ready to be joined to the jetpack already on the minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>I paid about $3.75 Australian each including shipping which I didn't think this was too bad seeing as it had to come from Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>Highly swooshable (in fact you can swish two per hand). Beautiful minifig (as others have commented on in other Alien Conquest reviews). A real retro Classic Space feel for those like me that are into that. So if you are trying to increase the size of your ADU army I'd highly recommend this set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"legomaniac","2011-08-04T19:53:05.52Z","Awesome minifigure with a jetpack","<p>Get this set free with LEGOs free set when you spend $35 or more. I never owned any Alien Conquest sets before and I might now consider purchasing more. Love the colors, helmet and weapon. I attached the binoculars to the gun to make a gun attachment. :)<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Space minifigure<br></li><li>New weapon</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The orange cones on top of the jet pack looked strange so I put them on the bottom to make it look like fire.</li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a nice free set and a great way to promote a theme to get more people interested in Alien Conquest.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Krataka15792","2011-08-14T15:57:30.417Z","Aliens Beware! A Hero Of The Skies Is Here!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is Krataka15792 aka Zok:InsaneMathWizard on BZPower, back with another review! I got this set after spending over $113 on Hero factory sets, because until Sep.1st, you can get this if you spend over $35 at the Lego <a href=""mailto:S@H"">S@H</a>. Unlike my usual style, I'll review this in Pro/Con format, due to it being a small set.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The main point of this set is that its supposedly an army builder. It has everything you need, including a special ADU gun, binoculars, a jetpack, and, of course, the ADU Soldier. Now, this soldier is the rookie of the ADU team, according to online sources. This set includes a very special piece to minifigures, a piece I've never had. Its the black piece that is used to connect the minifigure to the jet pack, and seeing this in the set made me very happy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build takes a good 30 seconds, at best. The jet pack is big and bulky, and I don't actually like it. The only reason to get this set is just for the minifig. Oh, and that black piece too. Very useful. Also, about the minifig, he comes with the Jetcopter and when you take off his helmet, he is double-sided. His first face is the trigger-happy face, looking like he is have a great time shooting at aliens. The other is sort of a confused face, but he gives off a confused smile. Now, onto the list...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>ADU Minifigure!</li><li>ADU Gun!</li><li>Black Chest Piece!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Jetpack is big and bulky.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the set should only be worth getting for the minifigure. It makes a great army builder besides that inflated battlepack. Plus, with just getting this at the Lego shop for free with only a purchase of $35, you can't go wrong! When, or if, it comes out in stores for $3.99 (That's the estimated price), consider getting this. </p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,5
"AETerry","2011-08-07T00:54:28.29Z","Jet Pack Review","Now that was sweet, a Freebie with my $35 + purchase at the LEGO store and it was certainly very fun and enjoyable to get and put together.<br><br>Little promos when you get them from LEGO are well worth the money on another set(s) when completing out a set. Especially as it's rare for me to feel these little polybags are ""throw away"" ideas for sets and designs with being quick and easy.<br><br>If you're a fan of Alien Conquest and are wanting more of the ADU minifigures, this is a set worth getting a hold of. You've got too the Jet Pack build for the minifigure and it's very solid of a small design build. It's a little hard to have him stand afterwords unless you tilt him backwards.<br><br>Like I said sweet and makes the experience of getting into a LEGO Store at least once well worth it and to continue my hobby of LEGO.<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"KodakKid365","2011-08-22T16:47:06.753Z","He's free? He's mine!","This set is on sale for free on the Lego Shop, if you spend more then $35 on Lego stuff. He has a cool helmet and uniform, and a nice little jet pack. His gun is great, and the binoculars are just like normal binoculars, but they don't work well with this guy. The helmet and the binoculars don't go together very well. If you are buying something just under $35, then I suggest you get either a small set or some extra parts of Pick-a-Brick Wall just to get him.",FALSE,5,5,3,4,5

But when you open this set, you instantly realize that this is not a set you would get for the building experience. No, this set is about the minifig.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-04T10:22:00.59Z","LEGO Space (Alien Conquest) - Jetpack Review","This set is my very first LEGO Space (Alien Conquest) set I've got and it's also great to build a LEGO army. I like the way how LEGO printed the torso and the legs. The helmet is the same piece which I've seen in the LEGO Space (Space Police III) theme. The face of the minifig reminds me a little bit of the one I've seen on the gangster from series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures theme. I don't have any figure from series 5 yet but I'm sure that the only difference of these faces is that the one of this set has a printing on the back. I also like the way how LEGO did the new laser gun. If you put the binoculars on that piece it'll look much cooler. It's a great little set to get and it's also a great set to start collecting LEGO Space (Alien Conquest) sets.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

His helmet is light blue and is the same design as the space man from series 1 of the collectible minifigures, but his was white. The helmet look really cool, especially in blue. His head is yellow and is double sided, one side he looks unsure and has one eyebrow up and one down and the other side he looks confident and has a big smile. He comes with a backpack which is what fixes the jetpack on. His torso is blue and double sided, both sides say ADU short for (Alien Defence Unit), His torso looks like a swat uniform but in blue. His legs are blue and have printing on them. His accessories are a new lego gun which is found only in this theam, the gun is like a laser gun or something like that and his other accessorie is some binoculars.</p><p><img style=""width: 97px; height: 134px;"" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/ac014.jpg""></p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The jetpack</span></p><p>The jetpack is nice, it comes with a nice piece that is a grey 2x4 plate.

"Huge_Nerd","2011-10-03T15:40:34.34Z","Great minifig hidden by other parts","<p>I got this little set free when I ordered the Star Wars Advent Calendar from Lego.com. The minifigure is very nice. The shade of blue and details on the body are all very sharp.&nbsp;I love the two faces. My favorite is the more&nbsp;skeptical look, which seems appropriate for a guy with a jetpack fighting this style of alien.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the&nbsp;jetpack itself covers up most of the nice detail.&nbsp;Otherwise, it's okay for what it is, but it could have&nbsp;used some pieces that look like thrusters (the grate piece doesn't really accomplish this).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, it is fun to&nbsp;swoosh this guy around fighting various foes.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,5,5
"clundsberg","2011-08-31T00:16:50.947Z","One of the best freebies to date!","<p>I initially got this for me.&nbsp; Yes, not knowing how my son would like this series (and me being more of the sci-fi type) I bought over $35 of LEGO to get this guy.&nbsp; The timing was great as I purchased some minis (as surprise gifts) and the Log Cabin (an item my son has ben asking for since it's release)&nbsp;to get this guy.&nbsp; Besides this is my first set from this new series.</p>
<p>Little did I know that my awesomely cool Jetpack guy was soon to be confiscated and favoured among the aforementioned.&nbsp; Thusly I switch my written review from that as an AFOL to a Parent...or maybe I'll comingle them.</p>
<p>I knew the minute I showed my son this freebie that he'd want to build it...and he did. Very exited to build it as a matter of fact.&nbsp; Here are some of the things my 6 year old pointed out:&nbsp; The double faces (one a sort of quizzicle look, the other a gung-ho, ""defeat all aliens"" combat yell.&nbsp; He simply loves double faced minis and I think this should almost become standard.&nbsp; He enjoyed the sky blue colour.&nbsp; I have never seen this colour with LEGO bfore and I must say it is brilliant and very cool looking.&nbsp; The Jetpack!&nbsp; My son loved building the jetpack and proceeded to zip around the room with this guy before running upstairs to introduce him to the others.</p>
<p>Other great features (not mentioned by my son, but noticed by me) were the great new helmet design. (the visor does not raise up, but you do get an extra clear face shield piece)&nbsp; The print on the figure (like the head) is on both sides of the body and quite detailed for a flight/jump&nbsp;suit. The accessories consist of binoculars and a newly designed ray gun, and the armor/chest plate which allows you to attach the jetpack to the figure.&nbsp; This part can come off fairly easy with play, but not a bad design overall and mine attached pretty well.</p>
<p>The jetpack itself is a fairly easy build, but still fun to do.&nbsp; It has a very nice design and when complete the pack is almost (barely) the same length as the figure, so he has stability when standing and won't tip backwards.&nbsp; I wish LEGO would put out the mini figure bases they do with the mystery figures so character like this can stand along with a sharp display.</p>
<p>Overall a great little mini for a low price (the spending of $35, I mean) awesome to have a few of these guys as a squadron or just to collect from a completionist point of view.&nbsp; You won;t be dissappointed with this addition, especially since the concept is not so far fetched to comingle with NASA or town LEGO sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
