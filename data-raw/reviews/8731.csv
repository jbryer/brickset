"TooMuchLEGO","2011-07-20T22:13:24.14Z","You know, it's not perfect, but it's fun. Very fun.","<p>LEGO video games have recently been the exact same- except the theme and characters. But though the gameplay hasn't changed much at all in this game, that's not to say it's not fun- I've had a blast with it. It doesn't hold the record for most playtime on my 3DS or anything, and it's not like you gotta go out and buy a 3DS so you can play it, but it's fun nontheless. I love the space battles and the graphics are gorgeous, and the 3D ain't too shabby either. And thankfully for the LEGO video game series, the&nbsp;game play&nbsp;has held up&nbsp;considerably&nbsp;well. I also enjoy the inclusion of&nbsp;mini-games, but they often keep me from playing the actual game.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Gorgeous Graphics</li><li>Great 3D (the effect doesn't make your eyes melt in this game, and you can see that one object looks closer than another.)</li><li>Fun&nbsp;Game play&nbsp;that's held up well</li><li>the new space battles, which resemble the ones in Battlefront 2</li><li>Machine Guns! :D</li><li>Fun Mini-games</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>People who don't keep up with Star Wars- the Clone Wars will have no idea what's going on (I myself was confused at one point)</li><li>The long levels- I'd prefer if they were shorter, they're super lengthy in this game</li><li>Having to purchase some story characters (really? I gotta buy Yoda?)</li><li>Mini-games can be more fun than the game itself</li></ul>
<p>Overall, the game is pretty fun. Yes, it could be better, and yeah, pressing ""Y""&nbsp;repeatedly to smash a baddie can&nbsp;admittedly&nbsp;get boring at points, but in the end, it doesn't matter.<b><i> LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</i></b> is the LEGO formula polished to the <i>n</i>th<i> </i>degree. You'd miss out if you didn't buy it.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,4
