<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Expectedly, the box is large. &nbsp;The front shows the Executor during the Battle of Endor, hovering above the moon and the Death Star II in the background. &nbsp;There is the usual banner showing the minifigures included (and exclaiming which are new!) and to flaunt that you are getting a huge model, another banner measuring its length. &nbsp;The back shows off the ""features"": the mini command center, the mini Star Destroyer for comparison, the info panel and stand, and a rear shot showing all 13 engines. &nbsp;Four smaller boxes are inside, one thin box that contains the 200 page spiral bound instruction manual and sticker sheet (yes, there are stickers), and 3 normal sized boxes that include the pieces.</div><div><br></div><div>Like the Death Star (10188-1), the spiral bound instructions are quite nice. &nbsp;Once again, if you have a hard time discerning between gray, dark gray, and black, then there will be times when you will realize you used the wrong piece. &nbsp;And considering this model is basically made up of those three shades, it could get a bit frustrating. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Do you need gray plates and countless dark gray 1x1 round plates and upright holders? &nbsp;Then this set is for you! &nbsp;But seriously, in terms of variation, there is not a whole bunch here. &nbsp;What you see is basically what you get, a lot of gray bricks! &nbsp;There are some colored bricks in the frame that allow for variation just because the build is so large, you need some guide ""bricks"" to find your way around the construction. &nbsp;The two black stands offer some nice sloped pieces and it's always nice to get your hands of some ""engine"" blocks. &nbsp;But it shouldn't come as a surprise that in the end, you are putting together a giant gray slab.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I love minifigures, especially when they produce characters that are lesser known or have little screen time. &nbsp;It's always a nice nod to the fans when LEGO goes the extra mile and throws in special figs like the Wolfpack Troopers and Quinlan Vos in the Republic Frigate (7964) or Captain Antilles in the Tantive IV (10198). &nbsp;Sure, these are probably included to encourage collectors to buy the high ticket sets, but it is appreciated nonetheless. &nbsp;In the case of the Executor, I feel LEGO missed an opportunity. &nbsp;Included are Darth Vader (again), Bossk (which you can get in the recent Slave 1), a new model of Dengar (previously only available from the earlier Slave 1), IG-88 (an updated version of the IG series droids LEGO has been producing for years, only in that he has a printed head and dark gray body) and a new figure, Admiral Piett.</p><p>This is obviously the cast from the bridge scene in Empire Strikes Back where Vader addresses the gathering of bounty hunters hired to track down the Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;But where is Zuckuss and 4-LOM? &nbsp;Those would have made some really nice minifigures and a welcome addition to the catalogue. &nbsp;But instead we get a figure you can pick up in a cheaper set, another droid (which I don't really count as a minifig), Darth Vader who can be grabbed in the current Falcon set, a figure that is just a reimagning and Piett, who in terms of variety is pretty similar to other Imperial officer figures. &nbsp;This is not to say the figures are not good. &nbsp;I love the new Dengar. &nbsp;The printing on his torso (front and back) is very detailed along with the detail of his face (scars, furtive grimace, head wrapping). &nbsp;The contrast of the white to brown is wonderful, and while his headwrap piece is not new, it certainly works. &nbsp;Piett, while similar to other figures, is still presented as his own model. &nbsp;Some wrinkles on his face, some details on his torso. &nbsp;But pretty standard stuff. &nbsp;Overall, the figs are good, but not great.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Put aside a weekend as you will need it. &nbsp;Also, have plenty of room to work. &nbsp;As soon as the basic frame of the model comes together, you will quickly realize how massive this thing is. &nbsp;I was pretty surprised as it took up the entire length of my coffee table as it was being pieced together. &nbsp;At one point, I didn't think it could have gotten any longer, but turning a page in the instruction manual showed me a section that extended the back and I was pretty impressed. &nbsp;This is a huge set, and with that comes the difficulties of building it. &nbsp;Thousands of pieces makes it difficult to find that one piece, so if you are the type that likes to mix your pieces together, you will be delighted. &nbsp;Luckily, the numbered bags are still in use and coincides with the build, so you don't have to dump everything out at the beginning. &nbsp;The build is challenging, especially since everything is gray! &nbsp;As the build continues, it just becomes a huge mass of gray and trying to figure out where to connect certain sections together is like trying to find Waldo. &nbsp;But, if you own previous Star Destroyer models, then this setup is no different, just longer! &nbsp;One other point is that there are tons of 1x1 bricks that make up the minute detail of the ships many decks, sensors, turbolasers, shield generators, etc. &nbsp;It is a great effect, but my poor thumbs were throbbing from sticking on endless numbers of them. &nbsp;The tiny command bridge is a bit small for any real play value, but it is fun to build and a nice addition.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Despite any criticisms I have made, this is still and impressive model. &nbsp;The sheer size impresses, as does the weight! &nbsp;You will need plenty of space to display this massive set, but the nice stand really helps elevate it off any flat surface to make it look like it is hovering through space. &nbsp;The mini Star Destroyer also gives it some perspective as to how huge this thing really is. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the minifigures do not fit with the removable command bridge top on, so you will have to display those separately if you want the ship to be intact. &nbsp;But it is truly a sight to behold, and knowing you put this beast together piece by piece is quite satisfying.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall, I think this is one for the diehard collectors. &nbsp;The price is steep, the variety of pieces isn't really there, it's large and will be difficult to display, there is little play value and forget about it's swooshability. &nbsp;The minifigs are nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the price just for two new figures. &nbsp;Despite these things, anyone who wants this model will certainly not be disappointed. &nbsp;I mean, c'mon! &nbsp;It's the freaking Exectuor! In LEGO form! &nbsp;How cool is that?! &nbsp;It's a testament to the wonders of Star Wars and to the quality that LEGO always provides!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,2,4
"zanfar","2011-12-27T02:09:32.633Z","Imperial Terror in LEGO Sculpture Form","<p>I've wanted to own a LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) kit ever since I was 12 when I first discovered they existed. I am now old enough to afford to purchase them myself (and make no mistake, they are investments, not toys) and decided to spend a bit of my christmas bonus while I was in Phoenix for the holidays. Overall, I am very pleased with the set. Words cannot describe how imposing it looks when built, the build itself is interesting, and the playability is exactly what you would expect of a UCS set--zilch.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>For the first time ever, I think the box under-promised what the model delivered. The box is huge--easily the largest I've ever seen--but the model is bigger. As with (all?) UCS sets, the box contains numbered boxes, which in turn contain numbered bags. Seven sets of bags, 3-5 bags per set in three boxes. The instructions are packaged in their own box, and are printed on high-quality 11x17 paper, wire-bound with cardstock covers.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Grey, grey and more grey. Aside from a few flashes of detail and landmark bricks, everything is grey, dark grey and black. Lots of small detail pieces, plates, wings and long technic struts.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Meh. Darth, Degnar, Piet, IG-88 and Bosk. They're cool, but not at all the reason to buy this set. Piet has an interesting portable holoprojector, and Degnar uses a cool built backpack. However, there isn't really any place in the ship to put them, so think of them like credit card points with heavy restrictions--a little extra for doing something you would have purchased anyways, but not particularly motivating.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>LONG. Given adequate space and organization, I (an experienced builder) was able to complete the build in 8 hours with minimal distractions and a few ""restore circulation to the extremities"" breaks. It would have been a bit more enjoyable to build in phases, say one bag set at a time, with several hours of rest in between. The fun would have lasted longer, and some of the x2, x8 or x12 builds would have seemed less like work. But, as I am wont to say, the LEGOs need building.</p><p>Almost everything is an x2 build, with several x5, x8 and x12 steps especially along the perimeter. There are no particularly interesting or novel assemblies, just lots and lots of bricks.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This set is not a toy. It has zero swoshability. Even if you could wield the eight pounds of bricks spread across more than four feet of length in a manner allowing play, the various assemblies are far too fragile to sustain any reasonable acceleration.</p><p>This set is, however, a masterpiece of LEGO display. It is imposing, massive and sleek.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>At ˜$0.12US per brick, this set is slightly overpriced even for a UCS kit, so it may be best to wait for the inevitable upcoming sales. If you think of it as a sculpture, this set is incredible. As a toy, it fails miserably--but it's supposed to. If you are a serious LEGO and Star Wars fan, this set will not disappoint.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,1,3
"Chills","2012-02-26T23:40:46.083Z","Amazing detail for an iconic SW ship","<p>This is really a great model for die-hard SW collectors.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: It's the Executor! I tried building this as a kid and didn't get close to the awesomeness of this model. It's pretty obvious the designer studied the movie models/photos/video because I have, and the detail is incredible.</li><li>Pro 2: The Bridge section is a cool addition. I also have the original UCS Star Destroyer and there's not much to it. With a ship the size of the Executor it's pretty cool the designer was able to put in a little something for the mini figures.</li><li>Pro 3: Comes with an Imperator-class Star Destroyer to show the scale. There have been so many false reports of the length of the Executor-class ships and this model shows the true length of 19,000 meters. Like I said before, the designer really did his homework.</li><li>Pro 4: Solid construction. The original Star Destroyer fell apart so easily, the magnets were a less-than-ideal way to attach the hull plates. The Executor is SOLID. You can pick it up and move it around without worrying it will fall apart. And with the stands being a decent width apart I don't think I'll see the sag in the hull I noticed with the original ship.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Price. Others have mentioned this and I agree. The UCS Star Destroyer was $100 less than this model, close to the same number of pieces.</li><li>Con 2: Like the original Star Destroyer (I know, there are a lot of comparisons) there isn't a lot of playability. I don't fault LEGO for that, if they wanted to add more movable sections (to make it more like the Death Star) then the ship would have to have been enormous... and more expensive.</li><li><br></li><li>Conclusion:</li><li>This is a great model which I am so happy LEGO came out with. I think they did a great job creating it and the construction was a lot of fun. There were a few monotonous times where you had X6, X8, etc, but that's understandable with this type of model. I think LEGO learned a lot from their original Destroyer, namely making this one solid and putting some mini-figures in it and having a bit of playability. I think the price is steep but overall I'm really happy I get to look at it each day. (BTW, this is my first review. I'm a long-time AFOL and I'm happy to have found this site)</li></ul>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,3
"gena","2013-01-22T16:33:39.16Z","Disappointed and Overcharged","<p>First off, I'm a LEGO collector,&nbsp;have been using LEGOs for over 40 years, and love all things LEGO.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever had a bad thing to say about a LEGO set.&nbsp; However, with that said, I was disappointed by this set and feel a little let down and taken by LEGO.</p><p>This is my first review here at Brickset, but as I feel other reviews are misleading, I thought I'd give my impressions on this set. An interesting thing about this set is that it seems to be universally panned on the forums, yet reviews are always glowing.&nbsp;</p><p>I am a huge LEGO Star Wars fan and own most of the other UCS sets including 10030 UCS Star Destroyer and 10179 UCS Millenium Falcon.&nbsp; </p><p>I don't understand all the negative comments about it being boringly one-colored.&nbsp; The 10030 UCS SD is completely medium gray and, nonetheless, it's beautiful.&nbsp; This set is a mix of medium and dark gray.&nbsp; The colors are fine and a non-issue.</p><p>To the detractors who say its a four foot long gray pencil, I'd have to say that I agree.&nbsp; I keep seeing reviews which describe this set as HUGE.&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; When I finish a LEGO spacecraft build, I'm almost always impressed and excited.&nbsp; With this set, it was the complete opposite.&nbsp; I was disappointed and underwhelmed.&nbsp; I built the 75004 Z-95 Headhunter ship a few weeks ago.&nbsp; The height and width of the UCS SSD are comparable to the Z-95 Headhunter (along with most other LEGO SW ships).&nbsp; Yes, the UCS SSD is 49 inched long, but it just feels small because of the small height and width.&nbsp; The killer for this set was when I placed it on the shelf next to the 10030 UCS SD.&nbsp; The UCS SD dwarfed it.&nbsp; THE UCS SD has bulk, impressiveness, WOW factor.&nbsp; The UCS SSD has none of these things.&nbsp; A Star Destroyer shouldn't be able to blow away&nbsp;a Super Star Destroyer in impressiveness.&nbsp; I think that's one of Newton's laws (or should have been) and for that reason alone, LEGO should've scrapped this set on the drawing board.&nbsp; LEGO was true to the SSD specs and ended up being held hostage by those specs.&nbsp; There was just no way to have given it enough length for it to have had any bulk.&nbsp; One forum commenter stated that this ship just didn't translate well into a LEGO set and that's the unfortunate truth.     In the end, it feels puny and I can't deny that it looks like a four foot long gray pencil.</p><p>The other scaling problem with this set turned out to be resolution.&nbsp; Other reviews state that it's ""highly detailed"", but it's not and because of the scale it can't be.&nbsp; There is a mini Star Destroyer included with the set in order to give perspective of the SSD's size.&nbsp; Unfortunately the UCS SSD is built at the same horrible low resolution as the mini SD, 1/15,000.&nbsp; For comparison, the 10198 Tantive IV is built at 1/280 scale.&nbsp; I've not seen this written, but expect that a lot of the LEGO SW models are in the 1/300 range.&nbsp; The 10030 UCS SD is 1/1500, but still looks great.&nbsp; The 1/15000 scale of this set, however, looks terrible.&nbsp; The surface is covered with 1x1 rounds and 1x1 clips which are, unfortunately, supposed to represent large sections of the ship.&nbsp; The overall feel is that it is incredibly low-res, just like the included mini SD.&nbsp; In my opinion, this is another reason this set should have been scrapped on the drawing board.</p><p>The 10030 UCS SD sold for $269 in 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation adjusted to 2012, that's $329.&nbsp;For $399, this set is a rip-off.&nbsp; It's not worth $299.&nbsp; I held off buying this set for a long time, but ultimately felt obligated in order to complete my UCS collection.&nbsp; However, this was not a worthy addition and I feel let down by LEGO on this one.&nbsp; The only way this set could have been salvaged, in my opinion, was to have added about 1000 pieced and 1-2 feet in length. Yes, that would have made it 5-6 feet long, but that was the only way this set could have had a small amount of WOW factor to have competed with the 10030 UCS SD.&nbsp; </p><p>I would only recommend buying this set if you find it on&nbsp;HUGE&nbsp;sale and/or are completing your UCS collection. Even then, you can't&nbsp;display it anywhere near other LEGO Star Wars ships, especially the UCS Star Destroyer or UCS Millenium Falcon without it looking puny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,1,1

HUGE!","<p>First thing to know about this set is that it is HUGE.&nbsp; I knew it was 3152 pieces, but looking at the photos prior to purchase I saw TONS of tiny bricks and studs and was unprepared.&nbsp; Turns out there are also a lot of the angular pieces usually found in space sets used to make up wings (sorry, don't know how better to describe them).&nbsp; I have a small table I've used to assemble all my Lego sets for the past 15 years and this thing was soon hanging off the ends.&nbsp; I measured it at 49"" long and 14"" wide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with most large scale ships the skeleton is made up of a technic framework that adds strength to the build.&nbsp; The finished ship sits atop two stands to hold it a couple of inches above the surface it sits on.&nbsp; There is a small Star Destroyer in scale that attaches to a clear piece to fly along side and make you realize how big the Super Star Destroyer is in the Star Wars universe.&nbsp; Most of the ""skin"" of the ship is built in LARGE sections that attach to the frame - this was my only complaint with the build - I had a difficult time attaching some of these to the ship.&nbsp; There are multiple mounting points for each, and getting them all to snap in was a challenge.&nbsp; The instructions were usually clear, but there were a couple pieces I managed to put in the wrong way early in the build that required I disassemble, fix and reassemble.&nbsp; The orientation was easy to miss in the instructions - never had that happen before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are minifigures in this set - a good way to pick up Dengar and Bossk if you missed them in their initial offerings.&nbsp; The top section removes to show the&nbsp;area&nbsp;that appeared in the classic bounty hunter scene from The&nbsp;Empire Strikes Back.&nbsp; If only Lego made a Zuckuss and 4-Lom to complete this scene....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I should comment on the playability of this set.&nbsp; Almost zero swoosh factor.&nbsp; There is no way a child is moving this set around to re-enact anything.&nbsp; It is a static set - playability is limited to the interior section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pictures just don't do this set justice. &nbsp;I couldn't believe the size.&nbsp; The size of this set is incredible, but also the biggest drawback (which is isn't much of one for a Lego or Star Wars fan I'd wager).&nbsp; You will really need to plan out where the finished model will rest.&nbsp; I have moved this thing about a half-dozen times trying to find the right spot (no way am I putting this away!).&nbsp; The good news is it has proven itself sturdy enough to be moved around without losing integrity.&nbsp;  I've had this set since it came out, and still find myself walking by and just stopping and staring it.

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge but it opens from left not up so it&acute;s hard to use it for some of my Legos that haven&acute;t a box. The instructions were mostly easy to follow.</p>

You had to put something in the destroyer but the destroyer wasn&acute;t strong enough: some parts were dropping all the time. It is annoying when you don&acute;t remember from where some random dropped piece had come from. Mostly the building was pretty nice and sometimes even relaxing. The age 16+ is still good: I don&acute;t think this is for kids.</p>

"Pheedle","2016-12-28T11:11:44.97Z","A triumph!!........Almost......","<p>This set was on my want list for years. Sadly I just missed purchasing it before it was retired from Lego.com......big mistake. As these things do the price doubled overnight, and when I had some money saved away it became a heavy decision to drop close to $1400 (shipping plus the amazingly weak Australian dollar of the time) for the set. But lets see how the sets goes in all categories:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building experience</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh man was the build fun. There are two types of Lego fan: those that like all the neat, straightening of 1x1 pieces, and those for whom the modular buildings series is a literal nightmare. This set falls in the middle of the two: there is a lot of detail that needs careful alignment, but not so much that you&#39;ll go bald with stress. You will need a very large, entirely flat work space for the first part of construction: don&#39;t be like me and do it on carpet..........The model can feel a little tedious at times as it is essentially a mirror of itself, but all in all the pacing of the build is enough to break it all up and keep things interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Now I have two major issues with this set, and the parts is one of them: firstly I&#39;ll say that the model itself has no concerns with parts. The plates are fine and the &#39;detail&#39; area in the center is constructed such that it adds a great sense of scale to the model, very reminiscent of the The Executor (with the exception of the docking area underneath: the model is very....flat on the bottom). However I have one question:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where is Boba&nbsp;Fett?!!?!?! Seriously, look at the minifigs!! Vader, Admiral Piett, Dengar, IG-88, Bossk, all there, but no Fett......how does that make any sense! They re-cast Dengar and Bossk for this set presumably because the existing minis were rather outdated, but Boba Fett, whom has multiple existing variants didn&#39;t get an include.........</p>

<p>*sigh* Okay, with that out of the way, lets move on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, there isn&#39;t any. And that not a bad thing. The collectors series is not a play-focused series. They are predominantly display pieces. and it does that really well. It has a removable cock-pit in which to place your bounty hunters, but that is it. For play, see the other Star Destroyers that have been released in resent years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for money</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, so here is the division. At its store price tag of $400 (or $700 is Australia, seriously, WFT Lego....) it would be an easy buy - that is&nbsp;the expected and accepted price for a kit of this size and detail. However buying it now is really a judgment call. I don&#39;t think its worth the large price-tag it has now. And thats not the sets fault: Lego is subject to huge inflation once its off the store, that is simply a reality&nbsp;of limited supply. However the reality is that it is a retired set, and I feel that it must be judged as such to a degree. So, in the store at $400, well worth the purchase. Now, at around $1000, very much to do with what that amount of money means to you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So to sum up: the set is a fabulous representation of a classic Star Wars ship, and looks great alongside the others of the collectors series. Aside from the difficult to accept or understand the exclusion of Boba Fett, the pieces and minifigures are enjoyable, and the build was broken up nicely to keep you engaged. If you can stomach the price then for sure give it a look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway to me not more than 3 of 5 stars (although looking forward)still will be in my held as a Collector.</p>

<p>Cheers.Good luck</p>

"Koot","2017-12-28T01:58:26.87Z","LEGO Star Wars 10221 UCS Super Star Destroyer","<p>This monster set depicts the iconic imperial warship seen in Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi. It contains 3152 pieces and 5 minifigures, 3 of which exclusive to the set.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong></p>

<p>The model is 1.24 meters long, and includes a large stand and a miniature star destroyer to give a scale of the size. A section in the middle of the model opens up to reveal the command bridge interior (inaccurately not underneath the command bridge on the top). I find this feature unnecessary - this is not a playset. Also, the interior includes many stickers.</p>

<p>The mini Star Destroyer included is held to the main model by two clear pole pieces, and I find that it tends to fall of regularly. The build process and unboxing&nbsp;is very remarkable for this set, and took me around 7&nbsp;hours.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Of the five minifigures&nbsp;included, IG-88, Dengar and Admiral Piett are exlusive. However, the Darth Vader and Bossk variants included still sell for alot of money. I would have liked a new print for Darth&nbsp;Vader however.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a hardcore Lego collector, this set is definitely for you. It is probably not a good buy if you are not that into Star Wars or if you do not appreciate an display set rather than a playset. At the moment, a sealed one costs around $1500 AUD (approx. $1200 USD)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>
