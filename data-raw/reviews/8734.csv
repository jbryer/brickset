<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Much like all other promotional sets, this little raft comes in a fairly large polybag, with plenty of airspace within the packaging. The instructions themselves are clear and easy to follow, but are very short, as you would expect from such a tiny set. One side of the A4 sheet is filled with photos of the posters included in each set and the set number that it's from. Not really much to say about this, though for those confused about the origin of this little boat, it's from one of the films in which Captain Jack is marooned on a desert island, this is the boat that sends him there. (I think anyway, the bag does show a desert island to back me up)</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this little set aren't particually interesting, minus the figure and rum bottle. Overall, it comes with 22 pieces (including one spare cutlas), a meesly amount, as Saturday's X-Wing Fighter came with roughly triple this for 40p less. The new rum bottle part is a nice piece, and minus the minifigure pretty much makes the set, as the other parts are pretty dull. On the parts front, this set really isn't that impressive.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The main part of the set, this is probablly what people are going to be getting the set for really. Included is one Captain Jack Sparrow with Tricorne and Cutlas. To my surprise, the Tricorne hat is part of the piece, although I expected the Hat to be seperate and attachable to the main hair piece through some bizzare way. The torso piece has back printing and the head is double sided, portraying a smiling and panicing Jack Sparrow. As far as I'm aware, the figure is made of completely redesigned pieces, minus the cutlas.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Dull, simple and boring. If it wasn't for the mast stand and asymetrical build, you would probablly die of bordeom building up Jack's so called 'boat'. The build takes about 20 seconds if you're organized about it, less if you just build as you go. Even for a small polybag set, you really don't get the expected build pleasure. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Not really much to say here that I haven't already pointed out. The boat doesn't look particually great, being built pretty plainly and being not even twice the height or length of a minifigure, if a good&nbsp;minifigure wasn't included, this would be plain rubbish.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Despite what I said throughout, I would actually recommend getting this set with the News of the World. It's fairly obvious the point of this set is a cheap and easy way to get your hands on a Jack Sparrow minifigure, which is frankly what most of you will use it for.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy to open, exciting large polybag, simple instructions that most people probably ignored in the main part anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as it was a freebie.... well, who cares, it's&nbsp;not like I am goint to try and sell the thing on internet auction sites! rip it open, bin the packet, much as was intendended!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple plain little parts as far as the raft is concerned.... well, it is depicting a simple little raft after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jack Sparrow Minifig is pretty darn smart. The Tri-corn hat and hair combo is a fun new part (well, new to me.) the double sided head ( with that fab little&nbsp;quirky jack sparrow smirk on it) allows for a new twist to any gameplay and the little rum bottle is just cheeky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again very simple, involving for a couple of seconds really, but it's not aimed at me it's aimed at kids. A simple build for young disney fans who are new to lego!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playable, put quite simply. A cute little set that can be played with and allows the young 'uns imaginations to go to work! AND also a great introduction to lego for folks who think TLG only make Star Wars stuff. An eye opener to the pirate theme's, and that can only be a good thing, surely?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It cost me £1 (well the paper did, but that got put straight back on the rack). For my £1 I got a noisy crinkly big polybag, A few bits for the tub that make a simple little raft if I want, and a cracking little minifig that has made me now go out and buy more PotC sets.... All in all it's a bargain for me and a job well done by the Lego chaps.... Definately the best of this run of giveaways.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-08-17T11:00:50.26Z","I guess I was too late to the pirates of the Caribbean range so I'm left with this pretty good polybag","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Jack sparrows boat (fairly straightforward) is a nice build and a nice figure .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigure has a very nice hat hair combo which is printed , his head on both sides represents the character , the torso is nice but the exposed skin is more than that flesh and legs are good too continuing from the torso . The accessory included is a sword I am not sure if the specific name .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is small get effective it uses two daily big black pieces for the hull , a mixture of 1&times;2 reddish brown jumpers on top and some pointy plates , the mast is simple but effective and the sail consists of two pieces there also is a bottle of rum on the back when he is seated there are only two studs inside not in use .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is my only pirates of the Caribbean set , I wish I got more not for the film&#39;s I have watched them and find them to be ludicrous but other sets were so detailed but I still recommend it .</p>
