"jonfurgeson","2011-06-13T12:05:46.363Z","A Solid Start to a New Series","<p>We subscribed to this series for my son who is a big Lego fan so that he can learn from the professionals. This first kit is pretty expensive per-piece, but if you count it with the whole first year subscription, it evens out a bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Materials</p><p>The box is large for the size of model, and is a lidded box rather than&nbsp;a wrap around a tray. It&nbsp;holds a quartered piece tray which is to serve as holder for all of the year's models. The other thing that fills the box is the oversized manual. This is, bar none, the best Lego instruction book I have encountered. The instructions are large and have many colors distinctly used to make them very easy to follow. Every page has tips, tricks, and trivia about Lego pieces and design decisions. Beyond the three build instruction sets, it has biographical information on some of the Lego Master Builders, and there is a section where the Master Builder for this&nbsp;kit speaks about the challenges he faced and worked through in designing these three builds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Minifigure</p><p>The first Academy figure looks pretty much like the one on the advertisement. His colors match perfectly with the theme colors for the set. The set includes a few pieces to make a large jet pack for the figure. The models between the Academy figures will also include pieces and instructions for other accessories to give the minifigures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Builds</p><p>Thus far, my son has built the first two sets (the plane - I forget the technical name - and the rocket). He is a bit below the intended age group, but he has still thoroughly enjoyed building both. Regarding the application of the skills, even though the first two tips are rudimentary skills, locking and sideways building, he is learning the jargon quickly and is intrigued by the idea of actual ""Lego skills"". He now applies the terms to his own builds, so one of Lego's goals is achieved. The two sets are well built and thoughtful, both in style and execution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playability</p><p>Both sets thus far have been fun to play with, especially with other space sets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall</p><p>This kit does well the job for which it was intended - to give some basic lessons on Lego building to children. The builds are quality and the manual is superb. We look forward to the coming year's deliveries!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"vynsane","2011-06-13T18:43:53.3Z","Space: The FIRST Frontier... uh, Kit. ","<div>The new LEGO Master Builder Academy, the replacement for Brickmaster in a way, is here (at least in the US, for now). With a hefty 82 page ""Designer Handbook"", 178 pieces, exclusive minifigure with brick-built accessories and a website dedicated to promoting additional tips and tricks, Master Builder bios, fun quizzes and other ancillary materials, the developers of this program have outdone themselves. The value goes far beyond the price per piece ratio.</div><h4>Figure</h4><div>The MBA Kit 1 set comes with the MBA Level 1 exclusive minifigure, who is meant to accompany the next two kits in Level 1. The parts that comprise this figure aren't all that exceptional save for the torso, which features the MBA Level 1 logo emblazoned upon the chest. The coloring is predominantly lime green with some white accents (hands and hips). The face printing is one of the more personalized variations of the classic smiley, with brown eyebrows and white dots on the pupils. The initial promotional materials all had the original smiley face, so the more personalized version is a welcome surprise.</div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>The accessories include items to make your minifigure a decidedly ""retro"" space-farer.</div><div><br></div><div><ul><li><b>Aviator Helmet</b> (black) - While a more futuristic helmet, like those found on the CMFs1 Spaceman or the Space Police 3 commandos, would have made more sense, this works within the ""Buck Rogers"" feel invoked by the ""Rocket"" build.</li><li><b>Goggles</b> (dark blue-gray) - Pairing the aviator helmet with a pair of pilot goggles is a no-brainer.</li><li><b>Jet Pack</b> (brick-built) - The first portion of the build is a jet pack with the minifigure neck bracket w/one stud and a 1x1 brick w/5 studs as the base, a few 1x1 lime slopes, a 1x2 grated tile, and two 1x1 round bricks for the jets, held together by a 1x2 plate and 1x2 jumper plate. The over-all effect is pretty cool.</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>One of the techniques espoused in the first Designer Handbook is ""sideways building"" (AKA 'SNOT' technique, though I personally like the official wording better...) so the parts include a good deal of bricks and brackets that feature studs on the side. Pieces of note are many 1x3 and 1x4 curved slopes, 1x4 tiles, and various 1x plates in lime, 1x2 cheese slopes, 1x6x3 curved bricks and 6x2 wedge slopes in white, 1x1 cones, 1x1 round plates, and 1x4 antennae in metallic silver, 1x1 round and 1x1 cheese slopes in purple, and the new 8x4x2 windscreen first seen in this year's Imperial V-Wing. Over-all the colors are predominantly white with black, lime green, standard green, light blue-gray, silver and purple accents in order of most abundant to least. Don't think of this as a complaint, but I found it odd that the pieces included two 1x2x2 brackets in green that aren't used in any of the builds! How's THAT for extra pieces!</div><h4>Builds</h4><div>The builds consist of one Jet Pack that can remain intact, and three other models that share the same pieces, so you must disassemble one if you want to build either of the others.&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li><b>Jet Pack</b> - though made up of a mere few pieces, the build is none-the-less inspiring with some nice sideways AND upside-down building, and your L1 minifigure has something to fly around in while you're busy making his next ship.</li><li><b>Helicraft</b> - Definitely the oddest looking of the three spaceships you can build, it's still a pleasing and sturdy design. It's pretty swooshable and the design is sure to inspire young builders. This being the first set of instructions, it introduces the concept of sideways building, utilizing this technique to construct the sides of the cockpit. The end result is an odd cross between a helicopter, a plane, and a spaceship.</li><li><b>Rocket</b> - In my estimation, this is the most pleasing design and objectively the sturdiest build. It utilizes the most pieces of the three designs, can stand upright on the rear fins, and just looks REALLY cool. The shape of the main body tapers into the rocket booster assembly smoothly and the wild rear fins look great while being functional as both the feet when standing upright and ailerons in atmospheric flight.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Space Fighter</b> - I was disappointed to find that this was the weakest of the three designs. It uses the least amount of pieces, feels a bit flimsy, and the hinged wings, while a cool play feature, don't really do much. I like the way the 3x12 plates are used as a long nose, harkening back to some of the earliest Space sets, but it's ultimately not as well thought-out a design.</li></ul></div><h4>Printed and Online Materials</h4><div>The ""Designer Handbook"" is a fantastic publication, with large-format pages and quality content. The tips and tricks, inside looks at the process of creating a LEGO set and even profiles of&nbsp;hobbyists, plus the online resources of sharing pictures of creations and rating and commenting on others really forms a sense of community. The website features video interviews, bios, alternate instructions and quizzes that reward members with 'badges' that unlock more bonus materials.</div><div><br></div><div>The box is a sturdier lift-top with double-walled sides. The idea seems to be that the inner tray can accommodate the entire year's worth of pieces (Kit 1 is the only one that comes in a box, apparently) and the rest of the empty space can fit all 6 Designer Handbooks.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>At first glance $30 seems a bit steep, but when taking into account all the thought that went into developing this program and everything you get for your money, it really puts things into perspective. Adding the rest of the year's subscription mitigates the price per piece ratio even further. Kit 1 is currently available as a stand-alone product at LEGO brand stores and online at LEGO Shop@Home for $30. The subscription for Kits 2-6 is currently $70. According to LEGO customer service, after a limited amount of time, Kit 1 will be enveloped into the subscription, which will then be $100, and ostensibly only be available online.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"AETerry","2011-09-19T17:13:46Z","Space Designer Review ","Where to even start?<br><br>As an introductory Kit that can be bought separately from the rest of the subscription, it does seem a bit high at $29.99. Bear in mind, as has been pointed out by others, that the rest of the kits/subscription at $69.99 in the long run, makes getting this worth it. Not only in piece counts, but the on-line content and alternative builds.<br><br>When you stick with just the kit itself, you have an excellent 84 page book talking about the MBA, plenty of photos and steps for building 3 different models, minifigure, a jet pack you can build for him, a -must have- brick separator and a very handy, useful box for keeping the sorting tray and pieces from not just this kit, but the entire 1-6 kits in.<br><br>As an adult, I've had fun putting the models together and going through the activities. I do hope LEGO has realized they're going to be getting the AFOL's, not just the target audience of kids and teens?<br><br>To get the full experience of this kit and the MBA, -do- take advantage of the on-line content and site. There's instructions for a 4th model that can be built, videos. In the fashion of true LEGO Geekdom, I went and printed out the diploma after finishing all of the tasks with plans to frame it and the other kit diplomas.<br><br>Yes, the front end cost is a bit pricy, but the long term subscription, piece count, the on-line material are well worth it. A down side to the high front end cost could be is this is where LEGO may be trying to recoup some cost of putting the MBA program together. I expect it to be worth it long run. I've got Kit 2 already and I can see stuff there I am learning that's new techniques.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"murphquake","2012-03-03T20:24:08.14Z","Wait your minifigure came with white pupils & eyebrows?","Overall I'm very happy with this buy, I contemplated it for a while but 
the release of Kits 7-9 pushed me over the edge and I'll be ordering 
them and the 2-5 Kits this week.&nbsp; The website for the MBA is quite nice 
and the instruction book is the best I've ever seen with a Lego set.<br>
<br>Pros
<ul><li>-An exclusive Minifig! ...but wait! Mine has the traditional plain Lego face as shown on the box and other people on here are reporting getting heads that have white pupils in the eyes and brown eyebrows? If there's 2 versions the collector nerd inside me wants the other too now!<br></li><li>-A chance to have all the building techniques I've been using for so long, as well as more modern ones I've encountered since I started my new Lego Star Wars collection last fall, explained and practiced with small tips and hints along the way.</li><li>-The LegoMBA.com website! Tons of content, badges to earn (a foursquare addict like me can't keep away), extra building instructions for the pieces, a great gallery of MOCs built by other Lego MBA members (of course they're having technical difficulties today, so although it worked great yesterday some things aren't loading today (just a hiccup, not a big deal)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The price per piece is a bit steep, less than 200 pieces for $30, but the code for the website, the awesome manual, a Brick Separator that isn't even mentioned as being included, and the sorting tray and very sturdy box kind of negate the Price-Per-Piece premium (PPP? P3?) Add in the Kits 2-6 Subscription and now you have over 1100 parts for $100 which falls in with the 10c PPP rule.&nbsp; Further add the new Kits 7-9 and you're getting close to 1800 parts for $160, as well as a slew of useful items and great manuals.<br></li><li>-The models are a bit simplistic and don't really appeal to my sensibilities, but they're solidly constructed with good ""swooshability"" and very strong design from what I've seen so far (Only built the Helicraft, Rocket and the Space Pod from the website so far, looks like the Space Fighter follows those examples)</li><li>-The Lime Green color doesn't do anything for me, probably because I'm more attuned to the Lego SW palette than this sort.</li><li>- The big white ""Half-Arch"" (name?) pieces really don't improve the models for me, I think they look cheesy. <br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I'm very happy that I picked this set up and think it and the following sets will be a good investment as I'd like to turn all the parts I've collected building my Lego Star Wars collection and few other things into something I can call MOC.</p><p><br></p><p>Found a pic of the alternate minifig face: http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/LCM/MBA1/mba34.jpg if anyone wants to see.&nbsp; Mine is the plain one pictured on the box.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
