It's a nifty tool, but none of its functions are that essential to experienced builders.<br><br>When I first saw this set at TRU in the USA, I noted that the measurement tool was warped in every instance I saw. It's basically a flat plastic plate... but every one on the shelf had significant warp to it. That's disappointing, given LEGO's usual reputation for quality.<br><br>In terms of value, this set will cost you quite a bit more than the brick separator on its own. Whether it is a good deal thus depends on how much you value the measuring tool.<br>",TRUE,2,2,1,4,3
