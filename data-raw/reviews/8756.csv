Probed!?...you NEED this Battle Pack!","<p>Looking to expand on your Alien Conquest kits and Moc's this well priced but a little lacking <strong>Alien Conquest Battle Pack</strong> is for you! Nice weapons and some great printed graphics on the figs. are the highlights here...but let's break it down...</p>
<h4>The Blister Pack...</h4>
<p>Narrower and overall a bit smaller than the Pharaoh's Quest Battle Pack, the overall look doesn't jump off the shelf at you. The Alien Conquest logo is too small (on all the AC packaging for some reason the graphics seem to sit too small on the art). Although I love the little UFO art 'abducting' the letter 'T'. The background art&nbsp;ovarall is&nbsp;boring. Nothing punchy or exciting. Just a street crosswalk with some buildings and a hint of&nbsp;UFO's in the background. </p>

<p>Back package graphics(AC logo sits better against the yellow back packaging).</p>
<p><em>Note that parts are made in Denmark and China(the figs themselves have that Collectable minifig feel)...</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts of Interest...</h4>
<p>Standouts are of course those wonderful new blaster pistols. Of note while we had the retro laser pistol from the Collectable Minifigures in pearl light gray/silver, pearl gold and even darker pearl gray, here is a mid ranged pearl gray toned retro pistol for the Aliens...</p>

<h4>The Aliens...</h4>
<p>-On the left is an <strong>Alien Trooper</strong> with retro laser pistol (glowing energy tipped).</p>
<p>-On the right is an <strong>Alien Pilot</strong>, also with retro laser pistol (glowing energy tipped).</p>
<p>Torso and leg graphics are excellent and the new head sculpts are fabulous. Note those wonderful 'squiggly' details on the tops of their heads...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Civilian...</h4>
<p>-Here is our potential abductee <strong>Civilian</strong> in nice pin-stripped business suit (pinstrip graphics are also on his back torso), brown leather briefcase(which opens) and duel-faced head (one side eager and wide-eyed, ready for work face, while the other side has the 'god I'm being...ahem...probed/abducted face). <em>You can also find this same civilian in AC set #7051</em>...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Alien Defense Unit Soldiers...</h4>
<p>-Here are our <strong>ADU Soldiers </strong>with their all-new laser blasters, great front and back graphic&nbsp;details (love 'em) and Space Police helmets (note also they are dueled faced)...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary...</h4>
<p>For the price, this is a great deal. 5 minifigures, some with unique head sculpts and graphics for $14.99usd is excellent. Although I like this Battle Pack since I'd like to expand my AC collection, I feel it's lacking a couple of things that would've made it a stand out pack. I think having a 'civilian' is unnecessary since just about any figure from anyone's collection can be this 'civilian/abductee'. I'd rather have had one or two Alien Clinger/Facehugger figs.&nbsp;instead plus a unique weapon like a longer blaster rifle for the ADU Soldiers. </p>
<p>But overall, this is a fine Battle Pack to help add more soldiers and Aliens into your Alien Conquest Moc's and Mod's plus if you're just a minifig. collector or are looking to customize figures, you get some great head sculpts, new torso and leg graphics to work with and a couple of new blasters to create new/unique figs.!</p>

"AETerry","2011-08-07T00:45:47.313Z","Battle Pack Review","Okay.... I was gonna consider picking this set up for my AC collection or at least the few that I've gotten when one of the Sales Associates at the LEGO store I was in pointed out that all of the minifigures in this battle pack come from other sets in Alien Conquest.<br><br>If you get set 7051 Tripod Invader, you've got the Civilian Minifigure... and if you have any City sets, you've got plenty of civilian characters already.<br><br>The other four minifigures are repeats of 7049 Alien Striker and 7050 Alien Defender - which for the same price, you could buy those two instead of this battle pack.<br><br>Yes you can make the argument that with 5 minifigures at $15 that's the same as buying 5 $3 packs of the Collectible Minifigures. <br><br>So it's going to come down to which way do you want to put down your money. The Sales Associate I was talking with had a point about buying these 2 other sets as you'll get the same Alien and ADU minifigures, plus they'll have more vehicles.<br><br>And remembering my experience with the Pharaoh's Quest Battle Pack, there's a certain lack of pizazz with the Battle Pack to make it really compelling for me to consider getting. And I can see it with this Battle Pack, if all I'm interested in are the Aliens and the ADU figures, I'll get around to considering duplicates of sets 7049 &amp; 7050.<br>",TRUE,2,3,1,4,3
"alva","2011-09-26T05:24:53.857Z","Nice Battle Pack","Just got them from a store yesterday. This is the first time I ever bought a battle pack. Because before this Alien Conquest Series, I always consider that buying sets will be better because you get some parts and not just minifigs. But for this Alien Conquest series, I really prefer the battle pack cause I feel that the prices of the sets are way too high.&nbsp; In my country Indonesia, the two smallest set, 7049 Alien Striker and 7050 Alien Defender, are priced around USD 10 and USD 20, while this battle pack only cost me around USD 10.<br><br>So, when I find that Lego release this battle pack, I quickly decide that this is the best way for me to have some Alien Conquest minifigs without spending money too much.<br><br>In this battlepack, you got two aliens, two astronauts, and one regular city guy. I think it will be better if they change the regular guy to alien or astronaut, cause I can get the guy easily in other city sets.<br><br>The aliens are quite scary looking. Different designs with the last alien that Lego released in Space Police 3. You can put them in your city sets diorama, and pretend they want to abduct some minifigs. Cute! The complain I have for them is each of them have different faces. One has a big jaws, lots of teeth, and small head, while the other has a ET shape head: small jaws and small head. They look like they came from two different races.<br><br>The astronauts are really cool. Really detailed uniforms and impressive guns. Not to mention the cool helmets.<br><br>Recap :<br>If you feel that the price of the Alien Conquest sets are way too high, then this is the best way for you to have some Alien Conquest minifigs without have to spend a lot of 
money. <br><br>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,5
"beegeedee","2012-02-20T04:58:15.86Z","Great idea, poor quality. Avoid.","<p>I wanted to complete the Alien Conquest theme so decided to get this set. 've not seen this available in stores but saw one on amazon for almost 10 pounds, I decided to get it. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Adds to the Alien Conquest theme by giving extra figures<br></li><li>2 unique ADU troopers added<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The 2 aliens are seen in other sets, as is the abductee/businessman<br></li><li>No building - fully assembled in the pack</li><li>Expensive part-to-price ratio - although figures are about the same as collectible minifigures</li><li>This is the kicker - the quality of the figures are shockingly poor. The legs and arms are loose and the hand grips are weak - when placing the guns into their hands they come off easily. I accidentally nudged one and it just fell out of the hand.<br></li></ul>
<p>So, considering at least 90% of the parts are already available from other sets I ask they question why are they so shockingly poor quality. The only differences really are the ADU trooper heads and while double-sided, I've seen similar heads on other minifigures before.</p><p>If you inspect the figures closer they have all the characteristics of the collector minifigures - no (c) lego on feet, underscored part numbers, sunk-in part numbers on inside of arms, thin plastic allows light through etc etc. This certainly points to manufacturing origins but with no reasoning behind it.<br></p><p>An incredibly disappointing set considering the good quality of the other Alien conquest sets. Don't bother even if you collect the minifigs or are a completionist as they are so disappointing.</p><p><br></p><p>Update: The troopers while listed as different are actually the same as in 2 other Alien Conquest sets.<br></p>",TRUE,1,2,1,4,1
