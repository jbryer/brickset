"DrOrrery","2011-06-18T08:07:44.663Z","Old vs New","If you look at my review of 10213 Shuttle Adventure you can see it's my favourite Lego set, so you can imagine my interest upon finding that they had released an improved version. &nbsp;Interested enough that I went through the new instructions to work out what was different and recreated the changes on my set. &nbsp;I thought there'd be enough interest out there to spell out the differences, so people can decide what to do with their existing sets, the new set, and the few remaining copies of the old set you may find on Amazon. &nbsp;One note, the sets are different, and ""better"" is highly subjective, so as much as possible I'm trying to limit myself to the facts. &nbsp;Opinion at the end. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>There are 4 main changes: &nbsp;Engines, Landing Gear, Satellite/Canada arm and the Main Fuel Tank. &nbsp;In order:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Engines</b></div><div>In the old model, the engines are a little finicky. &nbsp;I have on occasion needed to strip down the whole engine area to put things back together when something comes off. &nbsp;The plus side of finicky is there there's movement in the engines which matches the sort of movement you see on the shuttle at launch. &nbsp;In the new version the engines have been simplified a lot, the three large engines are pretty much fixed, a little movement but it's around the centre rather than in and out of the centre. &nbsp;Basically, more stable but a touch less accurate. &nbsp;How much you care about the accuracy of the engine movement is up to you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Landing gear</b></div><div>A lot was made of the fact that in the original, the front landing gear needed to swivel forward in order to retract. &nbsp;It is a bit annoying, especially since the wheel naturally faces back when the shuttle is moving on a table. &nbsp;Also, people noted that the rear wheels, when down, leave holes in the wings. &nbsp;Neither of these have actually changed in the new version, but instead all landing gear has been redesigned with strong technic pieces. &nbsp;I can't say what this is intended to alleviate, since I never really had any issues with the landing gear. &nbsp;The rear wheels no longer have the flat plate on top, which makes them less bulky but also a bit more obvious, and there's no longer a piece sticking out the side to stop the rear wheels going too far. &nbsp;The bump on the wings is still there, but now it's a different shape.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Satellite/Canada Arm</b></div><div>My biggest, and really only, issue with the original set is the satellite and Canada arm. &nbsp;Specifically, the satellite's antenna falls&nbsp;off whenever you look at it funny and the clip at the end of the arm swivels wildly when the satellite is affixed. &nbsp;Both have been solved. &nbsp;The satellite and antenna are both shorter but this has allowed them to bulk up the antenna, and the clip has been replaced with a lockable hinge block on the satellite grabbed by a lockable hinge cylinder. &nbsp;This works well, both the arm and the satellite are shorter as a result but both still look good.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Main Fuel Tank</b></div><div>This is a little fragile but was never a huge concern to me. &nbsp;Obviously it was to others, as TLC released a service pack for it. &nbsp;I still haven't got the pack although I would like to. &nbsp;However, that is NOT the fix they've put in here. &nbsp;The tank remains identical, but two long, predominantly technic runners are built and attached to each side of the tank, and the boosters are attached to these. &nbsp;If you look at the new box art you can clearly see these. &nbsp;For stability, they work, but they also completely alter the looks of the tank and boosters. &nbsp;This has also caused some extremely minor changes to the launch pad.</div><div><br></div><div>So, there are the facts, now my opinion. &nbsp;I thought the old set was a classic and the new one doesn't alter that opinion. &nbsp;Had you handed me the new version without the old, I would have said it was a classic as well. &nbsp;TLC has fixed my only peeve with the old one, the satellite and arm, and done it well. &nbsp;I may well make that change permanent. &nbsp;As for the others, I don't think they matter that much, with the exception of the main tank. &nbsp;The runners on the side don't belong there, they look wrong. &nbsp;Thankfully, by not changing the rest of the design, you can quite easily leave them off and you've got the old version. &nbsp;But that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it. &nbsp;If their service pack was so successful (and by all accounts it was), I can't understand why they didn't do it that way, keeping the clean lines AND fixing the stability of the main tank. &nbsp;Except perhaps cost, which is a tad disappointing.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, a wash, with a slight preference for the old one. &nbsp;Maybe that's cognitive dissonance talking. &nbsp;I suspect people will be happy with either set, and it's good to see TLC are listening to customer feedback.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"zanfar","2011-11-29T13:14:06.123Z","Best LEGO Set I've Owned","<p>Although most of them have been handed down to my neices and nephews, my siblings and I have owned close to 100 LEGO sets over our lifetimes. I say this so that you can put in perspective the opinion that ""Shuttle Expedition"" is the best, most fun LEGO set I've ever encountered.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As always, the box is oversized, which makes the purchase exciting, but the unboxing somewhat anticlimactic. I was actually a little nervous that the model would be smaller than I expected. This turned out to be an unfounded fear. The instructions were clear and as-expected.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I was disappointed that a set of this size did not use numbered parts 
bags, which meant that all the bags had to be opened within the first 
few steps. Parts were also not organized well (or at least using any 
system I could deduce) and identical parts needed on sequential steps 
could be found individually in separate bags. Extra small parts were included (and not needed) although I wish it had come with two extra transparent orange studs for the two smaller engines. The shuttle looks a bit unfinished from the rear without them.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One bearded male transport driver in blue suit with baseball hat.</p><p>Two male/female astronauts in space suits with gold-visored helmets and hairpieces.</p>This set is large enough that I swoosh the entire assembly, I haven't really played with the minifigs and don't expect to. The gold visors are awesome, however.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Very well done, straightforward and robust build process. I only remember one step (very early before the frame is complete) where the assembly was particularly fragile. By the time you start building the body the assembly is rock solid.</p><p>The landing gear was the coolest part, I love how they snap solidly into either the extended or retracted position. The cargo doors were frustrating until I realized that they are NOT mirror images of each other, and thus I wasn't actually missing any pieces. Careful following of the directions would have alleviated this, but the build was moderately repetitive at this point and I was somewhat on autopilot (you basically build two of everything past the nose wheel).<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>First, this model looks SPECTACULAR on display. The scale is just right and the proportions match the real shuttle. The launch pad is just enough to keep the model upright without too many fiddly bits. Although LEGO recommends against it, you can swoosh the entire shuttle/fuel tank/booster assembly holding just the shuttle. The final product is robust enough for moderately heavy playing as long as the fuel tank or boosters don't take a nose dive. The fuel tank and boosters separate easily and repeatably, although the pins on the boosters occasionally stay in the fuel tank.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Strongly recommended for any LEGO fan 6 or above. My five-year-old nephew could have built about 60% of this model without help and had much fun playing with the completed set. Some fragile pieces may fall off during play, but all are easily replaced. At about $0.10 per brick, this set is also a pretty good value for the money, especially when you consider most sets of this display quality don't have high swoosh value.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Duq","2012-05-15T17:32:04.85Z","A sculpture that tries to be a play set","<p>This set has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a very detailed play set or a functional display model? It's a complete re-design of set 10213 which apparently had some issues. I don't have the first version so I can't compare them.</p><p>Unlike set 7470, Space Shuttle Discovery from 2003, this set was apparently not endorsed by NASA. As a result there are no NASA logos and the shuttle is called 'Expedition', not 'Enterprise'.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions come in two books. The number of pieces per step confirms this set is aimed at experienced builders.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a good selection of parts in this set. From the box you can tell what you're going to get; lots of black and white plates, white curved pieces (arch and macaroni) and some dark orange pieces for the main tank. Not as obvious from the picture on the box is that you also get a good hand full of Technic pieces for the landing gear.</p><p>There are some printed pieces but unfortunately also a number of stickers.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set comes with three minifigs; two astronauts, one male and one female, each with a helmet with gold visor as well as a hair piece, and one ground crew member.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building the shuttle is interesting enough. It's not often that by step 25 your model is still only 3 plates tall but that's what happens when you first build the complex shape of the wings. There are some interesting angles at the back and the bay doors and parts of the cockpit use SNOT. The stickers on the wings of the satellite are not easy to get on straight.<br></p><p>Building  the booster rockets is not as interesting. Stacking all those white macaronis and lots of 4x4 round plates and bricks is repetitive enough the first time and then you need to do it all again. The big fuel tank is more interesting because of the shape at the top.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>From a bit of a distance the model looks great. The shape and colours are of course very recognisable. Have a closer look and you'll notice the landing gear poking through the wings. You also notice two strange grey beams running along the side of the tank.</p><p>The minifigs are way too big for the size of the shuttle. Or the shuttle is too small. A minifig-scale Space Shuttle would be nearly a meter long. Where the real shuttle has a flight deck and living quarters for a crew of 7 this model has cockpit just big enough for 1.</p><p>There is a little lever on the outside of the cockpit for extending the front wheel while the rear wheels have to be pushed down through the wings.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This model tries to be two things and falls short on both. For a play set it doesn't have many functions; the landing gear folds out, the bay doors open and there's the arm with a satellite. The flaps at the back of the wings move, but only down.</p><p>For a static display model there are too many compromises for the functions; the rear wheels that protrude through the wings, the little lever on the side of the cockpit and those ugly grey bars to stop the main tank falling apart in play.</p><p>The set is good value for money though, and with a few spare pieces the landing gear scars can be removed. The grey bars are also easily removed. Hide the minifigs and you'll have a nice model of a space shuttle.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
"murrayhenson","2012-03-13T18:29:24.29Z","Shuttle 10231 Go for Launch","<p>Lego set 10231 aka ""Shuttle Expedition"" is one of those must-have sets and doubly so for those interested in space, astronomy, etc. &nbsp;Honestly, how could you not want it? &nbsp;Just look at it.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This was acquired on my behalf via my wholly understanding wife who was on a business trip to Austin, TX and was roughly three kilometers from a nearby Lego store. &nbsp;Since this was a US purchase, the box was taped up rather than the European-style half-moon punch-outs.</p><p><br></p><p>The box itself is big and was of fairly heavy cardboard. &nbsp;Not super full inside but everything was safe and secure, even after riding 15,000 kilometers in checked luggage. &nbsp;There's a nice big photo of the finished product on one side which was a handy reference during assembly. &nbsp;I wouldn't call it visually stunning unless you get excited by the space program... in which case it is quite visually stunning. &nbsp;I wish, actually, that I had space for the box to be displayed next to the finish product but it's just too big.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I'm not really a parts person and to date have not purchased sets merely for the parts. &nbsp;I will say that I really enjoyed the mix of ""regular"" and technic parts, however. &nbsp;The technic parts are, I feel, well-integrated and clearly fill a niche. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I'm aware that between 10213 and 10231 there were a handful of changes, I think, mainly related to the stability of the model and its various parts. &nbsp;Those issues seem to have been addressed; the set is fairly stable.</p><p><br></p><p>My only comment is that with the very tight tolerances I noticed that the shuttle bay doors catch <i>very</i> slightly at the top/bottom (ie next to the cockpit and near the tail) and a bit of extra pressure or some slight back-and-forth jiggling is required to get them to shut properly. &nbsp;My shuttle bay doors also always have a ~0.5mm gap between them, give or take a few tenths. &nbsp;Not a huge deal but I just couldn't get them to come together cleanly like the model in the photos.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Three, two male and one female. &nbsp;The male and female figures' torsos and legs are the same. &nbsp;They come with&nbsp;interchangeable&nbsp;""hair"" or helmets. &nbsp;The third figure, in blue, comes with a little blue hat. &nbsp;They all look fine to me but I never get too worked up about the minifigs in general.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Excellent. &nbsp;It got a bit bogged down during the external propellant tank but it was also nearing midnight at the time and I'd been at it for about five hours at that point. &nbsp;Otherwise I found it quite engrossing although I did pause occasionally to take a few pictures.</div><div><br></div><div>I ended up spending about 2.5 evenings on it or around 12 hours total. &nbsp;As with the other models I've put together, I took my time and enjoyed the process. &nbsp;It was, indeed, quite enjoyable (especially the technic bits). &nbsp;As always, I love the detail that Lego puts into the parts of the model that you can not normally see not to mention the work that goes into making sure that models can stand under their own weight. &nbsp;Little things like the assembly in the nose of the external propellant tank, in particular, are for me what truly makes both the build and the final product so enjoyable - knowing there's much more under the surface.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_01.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_02.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_03.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_04.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_05.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model, when finished, is perhaps a bit on the delicate side. &nbsp;The external propellant tank in particular can not be handled too roughly and considering that the SSRBs, the tank, and the shuttle are not attached to each other with more than two technic pieces each it must be handled with some care. &nbsp;The shuttle itself, however, is pretty sturdy. &nbsp;The satellite arm wobbles a bit but not much and I love that they made sure it could actually be stored in the cargo bay.</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_shuttle_10231_06.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I noted at the beginning of my review, ""just look at it."" &nbsp;It looks awesome, it feels like a badge of geek cred, and it's a great way to spend a weekend or several evenings. &nbsp;If you're a fast builder I would encourage you to slow down a bit and think about what is being built because it truly is a marvel.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

"NYC231","2014-03-24T17:22:13.41Z","Amazing LEGO set","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was so much bigger than I imagined it would be and has great artwork on it showing the shuttle from all different angles. The instructions were very easy to follow and consisted of two instruction packets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has 1230 pieces and just a few &quot;special&quot; parts just for this set. The parts are mostly just ordinary LEGO pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes 3 mini figures:</p>

<p>- A female astronaut</p>

<p>- A male astronaut</p>

<p>- A service worker</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build, I thought, was very fun. It was cool to see the shuttle taking shape throughout the building process. In some ways, this could be educational in that kids get to see the different parts of the shuttle like the CanadaArm, main engines, and the crew area.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed product just looks amazing, not to mention the overall sturdy structure to make it very playable. (More so than the Shuttle Adventure.) The only problem would be that the cargo bay doors have a very slight gap where they meet up to close. This is only a VERY minor defect and does not take away from the overall beauty of this completed set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As an avid NASA fan, I believe LEGO certainly did there homework on this set. Obviously, this model isn&#39;t perfectly like the real NASA shuttles, but I&nbsp;believe LEGO did everything that they could to capture the image of the space&nbsp;shuttle and its legacy. They&nbsp;did a very good job of making this set more sturdy than its predecessor, the Shuttle Adventure. The subtle changes that LEGO made, like making the wheel mechanisms better and adding bars to the fuel tank to better hold the SRBs, defiantly made this set. If you are deciding whether or not to pay a little more than face value for this set, because it has been retired, I believe it is well worth the money!&nbsp;</p>
