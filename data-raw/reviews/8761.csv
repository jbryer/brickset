"PdxPhoenix","2011-06-23T14:18:22.697Z","Finally !","<p>Been waiting for a calendar for years from / out of LEGO.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Printed Numbers.<br></li><li>Comes with a couple collectable minifigs ( Cheerleader &amp; Skateboarder from the first series.)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Consecutive months printed back to front : Feb is on the back of Jan, so you can't (always) keep the calendar running from mid-month to the middle of the next...<br></li><li>Numbers are only printed on one side... Would have been GREAT to have them printed in, say, red on the opposite side of the black for holidays / other important dates...</li></ul>
<p>Great set... just this close to being an awesome set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,4
"Cult_Of_Skaro","2011-07-10T16:43:19.467Z","LEGO SCORES!","<p>All right, I've gotta give it to LEGO. A Perpetual calendar that you get to re-build every month!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>5/5. I really like the box. The best thing about is that the September it shows built on the box is actually 2011's September. The instructions are nothing terrific, however.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>5/5. The printed bricks are really great. However, there is one thing I dislike. The month bricks are printed on both sides, which limits them a bit if you are trying to use some of the consecutive months. Also, during February and the thirty-day months, you have to use some of the number bricks like blank bricks by turning them sideways. However, both of these problems have a good thing about them. Less pieces means a lower price. So the parts all average out in the end.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Being a big fan of&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures, I have to give these a 5/5. I missed Series 1 completely, and was very happy to get another chance. However, the Skater really isn't very interesting, and it really ticks me off that they gave him an un-printed board. But I like the torso design, as well as the hair-piece.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>4/5. Interestingly enough, the build was quite enjoyable. It's very simple, but there is something quite fun about stacking the bricks into a rectangle. However, it was&nbsp;simple enough that I can't give it a 5/5.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Great look! the&nbsp;colors&nbsp;blend together quite nicely, and it's going to be great for building on top of. As it's July, I'm soon planning to arrange a LEGO fireworks display on top of it. In October, I'm going to utilize some other Collectable Minifigures, namely the Witch, Vampire, and Werewolf.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I give this a 5/5. I would definitely suggest that you buy this. For 14.99 USD or 9.99 GBP, it's well worth it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"ytjedi","2011-08-07T01:21:27.74Z","Excited for the possibilities","<p>Though not playable in the traditional sense, this set will at least have you going back month after month to shift the days over. I'm not one for buying a new paper calendar every year, so this is great.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Includes Series 1 minifigures (though they may not be the ones you're looking for)<br></li><li>Printed pieces with numbers, days, months; good MOC potential<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Months are printed on the front and back, making it difficult to display consecutive month names<br></li><li>It may be just me, but the minifigures feel like a cheaper plastic than is traditionally found in sets<br></li></ul>
<p>While I'm not crazy about the colors of the set, the thing I'm most excited for is to exchange out colors that fit themes of the months or holidays. I can already picture filling in oranges and blacks during October, or reds and greens during December. Being made of LEGO the best thing about this calendar is that you can make it anything you'd like it to be!<br></p>",TRUE,1,4,3,4,5
"alva","2011-09-21T02:02:51.81Z","Great Calendar to show off","The main reason for me to buy this set is because I always want to display a bit of my Lego collection in my office, but I could not find any reason to do that and if I just putting a regular set or some minifigs will make me look 'not mature enough'. <br><br>So, when I found this calendar set, I finally find a good enough reason to display some Lego in my office. And if my boss catch me playing with my set, I will just say that I am revising my calendar:)<br><br>There's a lot of printed bricks come with this set. There are couples 2x2 white bricks with number 1-31 for date, 7 pieces 2x2 yellow bricks with day names, and 6 2x10 white bricks for month names. I think it will have a lot of use for MOCing.<br><br>Also, the set come with two series 1 minifigs, the cheerleader and the skateboarder. I dont know why Lego decide to put these two minifigs in the set. Probably the cheerleader is there to cheer up your days, but why skateboarder? I think the best answer to this is because Lego still have many stocks of these two minifigs :)<br><br>Recap : I think this set is great for us, AFOL, that want to place a bit of our hobby in our workplace without looking to childish. <br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,5
"Mikey_1703","2015-10-22T06:39:04.38Z","Endless Play ad infinitum","<p>This set has turned out to be the one I play with the most, as every four weeks or so, I am at it again, remodelling it to suit the new month. It becomes my #instagram and @twitter image of each month, as my #MinifigureCollection help me give it a theme each month.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I am not even sure if I used the instructions the first time around. Make the first row (I think you start from the top row and work down. You just need to work out whether you want the&nbsp;week to start on Sunday or Monday (to me, it is ALWAYS Sunday!). Starting next year, I might mix it up and begin the week in the first of the month - it will freak my wife out :)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A&nbsp;mix of very standard but colourful 2x2, 3x2, 6x2 bricks, some plates and printed white pieces with numbers and months on them. You can mix up the end pieces to match each other, or to go with life&#39;s genereal theme of chaos and put whatever you want wherever you how to put them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a Cheerleader and Skateboarder &quot;dude&quot;. These two have moved into my minifig collection, and our &quot;Lego selves&quot; have moved out to the set. We keep the other &quot;themed characters company&quot; for the month. Quite often we dress up to suit the scenario.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set is an easy to build as basic LEGO pieces allow.&nbsp;I gave it 5 as you rebuild it 12 times a year. What it misses in complexity, makes up in longevity.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As time ever marches on, the model never is actually finished. Luckily it does not include year numbers, and I would expect most of us to know which year we are in :).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great little set that shows off your Lego devotion, being both geeky and useful.</p>
