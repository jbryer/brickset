It runs a similar style of game play like other LEGO Games where you have chapters for either different stories or movies in this case that are being played through. And there are enough cut scenes and videos that keep it entertaining.<br><br>You have a ""hub"" area where you can walk your character through, interacting with different objects, often times this is hitting and busting them apart to collect LEGO studs. The stud pieces are basically coinage that are collected in the hub or during a chapter. You use these to purchase and unlock different characters. Different characters will make it easier to accomplish tasks, unlock areas within a chapter to collect all of the different items. And chapters within a story or movie can't be unlocked until a previous chapter is played through.<br><br>My biggest complaint with the game over all is that at certain points during the game, especially the Maelstrom chapter and fighting the Kraken, it could freeze and I'd loose progress with having to restart the game. Annoying, but not impossible to play.<br><br>Since you can constantly replay the game and chapters, completion is a matter of perspective. For me that was collecting and unlocking all of the different features within the game.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,5
