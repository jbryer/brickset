I don't plan on using it as a bath towel, but to pour some bricks on for a quick build or sorting pieces.&nbsp; It is only printed on one side and the fabric seems a bit thin for a bath towel.</p><p>Has a fabric hook on top of the towel by the logo and on one side to hang the towel on a hook.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>This towel will go great in any LEGO themed room. I find it is more suitable for a beach towel or to pour your LEGO bricks on and pick up the towel for easy cleanup.<br></p>",TRUE,5,1,1,3,4
