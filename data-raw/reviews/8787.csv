"Cligra","2011-08-24T18:49:15.313Z","Very nice!","This beautiful book, brought to us by the fine people at <a title=""View all sets in the subtheme Books/Dorling Kindersley"" href=""../../search/?theme=Gear&amp;subtheme=Books/Dorling%20Kindersley"">Dorling Kindersley</a>, is a worthy addition to any LEGO Harry Potter fan's bookshelf. As well as having page upon page of beautiful colour photographs of old Harry Potter sets, it also comes with an exclusive minifigure. The book is well made and well written, and I spent several hours reading straight through it. The only real con this book has is it is a bit pricey, but well worth it, really.<br>",TRUE,4,3,1,1,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T15:21:47.28Z","Build a Magical World","<p>Set 500215 Harry Potter Building the Magical World from DK Publishing: The second book to be produced in the vein of LEGO Star Wars The Visual Dictionary, this LEGO DK collaboration is a must have item for any LEGO Harry Potter fan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book features 96 pages of fun facts, LEGO pictures and detailed information on every LEGO Harry Potter set released from 2001 to 2011, with two exceptions, The Lab and Trolley Polybag sets are not referenced in the book at all. Being Polybag sets I can understand why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the LEGO Star Wars VD from 2010 this book features only two chapters, the majority of which is centered around the seven films/books of the Harry Potter franchise and all the LEGO sets made from 2001-2010. (The 2011 sets have their own seperate page in chapter two near the end of the book.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really this book is a very good read and an excellent companion piece to the LEGO Harry Potter Theme, the second chapter also features more information similar to what was found near the end of the LEGO Star Wars VD book. With data on how the sets were originally concieved, how the video games were programmed and such and as I mentioned the LEGO Harry Potter sets of 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This book also features a unique Chinese made Mini-Figure. Harry Potter in his Yule Ball robes. The printing is immaculate with a double sided torso showing off Harry's robe design and then he includes the double-sided head from most of the other recent Harry figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 25$ you really can't go wrong with this book, it has a lot of great pictures of the LEGO Harry Potter sets and Mini-Figs, detailed information on them and even includes a special LEGO Harry Potter Yule Ball Mini-Fig. If LEGO has finally put this Theme to rest it's nice to see that it has such a great send off with this book. I kind of hope however that we haven't seen the last of LEGO Harry Potter.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,3
