"Cligra","2011-10-16T18:44:37.25Z","Nice idea, ugly set","<p>When I found out about this set (and <a title=""View full details of set 40020: Halloween Set"" href=""../../detail/?Set=40020-1"">40020</a>), I was fairly excited. I didn't expect this one to be that great, but even with those expectations, this set was more then disappointing.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>A basic polybag packaging. A nice background image, but nothing really special here. The instructions are folded, of course.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Meh. Lots of hinged things, but nothing too unusual.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The spiders must have eaten them.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>At least this set actually HAS proper instructions, unlike <a title=""View full details of set 40020: Halloween Set"" href=""../../detail/?Set=40020-1"">40020</a>.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Two ugly, ugly, spiders. They might work as Halloween decorations, but anything else is pretty much beyond them (although the larger one does go well with set <a title=""View full details of set 4865: The Forbidden Forest"" href=""../../detail/?Set=4865-1"">4865</a>).</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Blekh. At least it's cheap. Buy it, if you want two really ugly Halloween decorations.<br></p>",TRUE,2,2,3,3,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The color scheme is classic and perfect. <br></li><li>-This set is truly great in multiple copies, for your spider army. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The spiders are quite fragile, in my opinion. <br></li><li>-Where are the spider pincers?<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is really creepy-crawly, it looks really cool, and comes at a great price. Buy it!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,5
