<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This is a polybag set with a set of instructions on two sides of a folded sheet.<br><br>One thing I must comment on that my daughter was asking, is why the black pieces for the set are shown as grey in the instructions. It's a good point, as I've found myself later, when rebuilding other sets, getting confused on if the piece called for is grey or black.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There's plenty of bright colorful bricks along with extras in the bag that my daughter gave to me for the parts bin. Some of the pieces were a bit more ""advanced"" for my daughter to work with as she's used to the ""basic bricks"" of 2x2 and similiar.<h4>The build</h4>There are three Santas in this kit. The builds are overall fairly easy to follow with clear illustrations.<br><br>The first build of Santa on a snowboard my daughter successfully built without needing any help.<br><br>The second build of Santa on a sled was a bit more complex for my daughter who needed just a bit of help with counting the studs (the bumps) for placement of elements and then making sure pieces were pressed down firm enough that it held. This was the hardest for her to build, but she did most of it.<br><br>The third build is of Santa on skis and this like the first, my daughter was able to put together with minimal help. All I had to do at one point was point out she'd missed a step with placing the small ""cheese wedge"" red roof pieces that form part of Santa's stomach.<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'd say this set went over rather well with my daughter who enjoyed putting it together. It was simple enough for her to follow the instructions without getting too lost or needing too much help with a couple of steps. So long as she continues to show an interest in LEGO, I plan to continue to get her some more sets and as she's ready for them, obviously the more difficult and complex builds.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
