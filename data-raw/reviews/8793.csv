It's perfect for your older, more advanced LEGO enthusiast and collector.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The kit comes in a polybag with a folded sheet for the instructions with clearly printed illustrations for each of the steps in building the tree.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There are 77 pieces, most of which are green and perfect for creating a tree build. There is also a few extra of the 1x1 round plate pieces that make up either the lights or ornaments on the tree.<h4>The build and Completed Model</h4><p>I referred to this set as being good for an older, more advanced collector as what isn't seen in the picture of the model is that there's a black technic pole that's pushed down into the brown base of the tree and that each level of branches slides over it. The use of this pole provides a lot of stability for the kit. It also makes it so each level of branches can be angled out away from the tree more like a real tree would be.</p><p>The presents that are placed under the tree around the tree skirt are a bit boring all being essentially the same repetitive build just different colors. Perhaps different shapes of boxes for the present. I also would have liked on the tree more color variety and maybe the use of transparent pieces for lights. The use of the gem piece at the top for a star is good though.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For a polybag, the pricing of this set wasn't all that bad coming in around $4.99 for the kit. It is perfect for a bit older LEGO collector given the slightly advanced use of technic pieces on the trunk and branches of the tree. And in the end it is the perfect holiday decoration to place around the house.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
