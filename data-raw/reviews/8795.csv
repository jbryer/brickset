<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I am (was) an architect, I have not been&nbsp;thrilled by most of the Architecture series.&nbsp; When I first saw the&nbsp;Robie House image&nbsp;on Brickset, I thought&nbsp;it looked fantastic.&nbsp; Later, when I heard the price to be $200, I hoped for interior detailing, maybe some Lego versions of&nbsp;the furniture Wright designed for the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In person, this model does look&nbsp;fantastic.&nbsp; The massing and lines of the original house are captured very well, along with&nbsp;some of the detailing.&nbsp; The dark red color, although not the tan of the original house, is beautiful.&nbsp; There does not appear to be any interior detailing or furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am disappointed with the size and the price, however.&nbsp; Yes, there are over 2,000 pieces.&nbsp; There are clearly many, many 1x2 and 1x1 plates.&nbsp; While that&nbsp;accurately reproduces the brickwork of the original house, it does (artificially?) inflate the piece count (and the price?).&nbsp; The model also is somewhat smaller than I expected (again, due to to the multitude of small plates).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, I am pretty ambivalent about this set.&nbsp; It looks great on the outside, but I see minimal play value, and I wonder about the overall&nbsp;value of the set for the price.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,1,3
"jb3pin","2011-09-28T02:17:09.597Z","Tedious build with all the 1x1 pieces but overall great result and nice model.","<p>Unfortunately there are a lot of small pieces and while I suppose that inflates the price I do appreciate the more intricate build and end result in how it represents the original. &nbsp;Overall it's expensive for what you get, but I really appreciate FLW architecture so this was a must have. &nbsp;Thank you VIP points. &nbsp;I would however agree that some interior detail would have been nice and really added to the model's ability to remove layers.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I like the black boxes on this series, so like the others this is a nice box. &nbsp;I wish however the instructions were bound like Falingwater. &nbsp;This has a lot of small pieces and it was difficult to keep the instructions open, with little reflection from ambient light and yet not ruin the glue binding. Wire binding would have been much better.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Overall the parts are fairly standard. &nbsp;Nonetheless I do like the color palette and the&nbsp;Slope 33 3 x 3 Double Concave. &nbsp;I hope this piece becomes more common, I have a MOC in LDD that needs a proper roof!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>N/A</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was fun, but any build usually is for me. &nbsp;The instructions take a general counterclockwise approach to the building itself. &nbsp;I really like the baseplate which is more substantial than a standard plate, although care had to be taken to make sure the base didn't develop a curve and cup slightly so the model wouldn't lay flat. &nbsp;There's LOTS of 1x1's. &nbsp;My fingertips hurt from stacking 1x1's and trying to get them as straight as possible. &nbsp;At times this became a little monotonous. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's beautiful, really like it and the overall size.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,4
"Olamisai","2011-12-11T15:40:05.14Z","Finger killer that looks awesome when done.","<p>For the sadistic plate-layer, a dream. For those who are willing to sacrifice a couple of fingers, well worth the pain. For kids.. erm.. no.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Yeps, another black box, and for the first time ever, there's no 'air'. This one is chokka full o' pieces and a rather large, suprisingly heavy, manual.<br>Instructions, whilst not helped by the glued spine are clear and easy to follow.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>1x2x god knows how many. 1x1x nearly as many. Dark red, some more dark red, a bit of white, some grey, black.. and did I mention dark red?<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Nano-figures might have been included in the box, but I couldn't find them :(
<h4>The build</h4><p>Ever built a house?.. a real one?.. I can imagine that this is what it feeels like. Actually..not that bad, considering the multitide of 1x2's everything comes together suprisingly quickly. Base, ground floor, top floor, roof done. Yes, stacking some 30x 6x(1x1) plates murders the fingertips. Tip for those wanting to make everything look nice and neat, use a spare 1x6 brick to 'force align' the 1x1 tiles, or stacks of 1x1 plates (use the table you're working with to your advantage).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>Large'ish, extremely impressive, and definitely something to stick somewhere noticable. Shame about the base curving upwards about the corners, though the models weight should help to flatten things over time.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>No playability whatsoever, but for those into 'talking pieces', a must have. My new favorite architecture set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,4,1,4

"InfiniteEin","2011-10-04T15:20:26.817Z","The biggest set built out of the tiniest pieces I've ever seen","<p>When it comes to the architecture series, this is a good as it gets . . . which is pretty good.&nbsp; The build is great and time consuming.&nbsp; Because of the all the small pieces in each step, you get to watch this house rise out of the base plate very slowly. This thing is literally built out of the smallest 1x2 and 1x1 red bricks.&nbsp; So with bricks that size, extra care has to be taken to line up the pieces properly so it doesn't look sloppy. Lining up all the 1x1 tiles is a pain.&nbsp; If you have the Farnsworth house, you know what I mean.&nbsp; This set takes all the difficulty of the Farnsworth house and cranks it up to eleven. Many times while looking at the instructions, it is difficult to tell what pieces are being added because the pieces are all the same color and did I mention . . . small.</p><p><br></p>Lots of parts in this set.&nbsp; Mostly red 1x2's and 1x1. But there is a lot of clear 1x1's as well.&nbsp; This is the tiniest pile of legos you can make with 2300 pieces.<br><br>Playabitlity? Um not really. This is strictly a viewing experience.&nbsp; The instructions say that the house was purposely left empty inside so that you can put tea lights in there to light up all the windows.&nbsp; I have done this and I have to say it looks pretty cool. I put in 4 tea lights, led's of course, and every window lights up. Very cool looking and kind of creepy in the dark.&nbsp; For some reason though, on the first level of windows in the front of the house, Lego decided to block them off with a 1x10 white piece so no light goes through those.&nbsp; This is easily fixed by removing this piece, but the purpose of this piece is questionable. The same with the two bow windows on either side of the house, they are blocked with Lego pieces that can be easily removed so light can be seen through them.&nbsp; <br><br>There is no value for the money in this set. It is horrendously expensive at $200 plus tax.&nbsp; The base is barely over a foot wide.&nbsp; So when your all done building and you look at the size of this thing, you may not want to tell people you paid over $200 for this set.&nbsp; But at least it comes in a cool black box with fancy looking instructions that have facts about the real house right? That's what I have to tell myself.&nbsp; <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent build<br></li><li>Looks really cool with led lighting inside (not included)<br></li><li>Its pretty.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Silly placement of a few bricks blocking light from getting through windows.<br></li><li>Price is disgusting.</li><li>For some reason, more than one person I've shown this to has thought it looks like a building from Japan and not modern American Prairie architecture like its supposed to.&nbsp; I think this is due to the color mostly.&nbsp; <br></li></ul>
<p>If you collect the architecture series, this is a must have.&nbsp; If you want value for your money, avoid like the plague.&nbsp; But as a bonus, if you can't Google the Robie House, the instructions will give you a history lesson! Knowledge is priceless right?<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,1
"Smell_o_vision","2012-03-27T14:34:50.69Z","A nice display piece.","<p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A very good looking model.<br></li><li>Nice scale and detail.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Base plate is a terrible design</li><li>Vague instructions<br></li><li>Its regular retail price of $200 is a bit expensive.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a nice building and makes for a great display piece. Obviously, as others have stated, there are a lot of 1x2 plates to put together. While this was a bit time consuming and at times. a real pain in the finger tips, I found all those 1x2 plates really added to the model's sense of realism. I also really liked the Robie house's general size/scale in comparison to some of the other Architecture sets. My main complaint is the terrible base construction. There had to be a better way to make/design the base plate. The fact that it flexes as much as it does is unacceptable for a set that has a retail price of $200 USD.</p><p>Maybe I'm just expecting more from this set due to its somewhat high regular retail price and the line's perceived up-scale packaging? Either way, the flexing base detracts from the model.</p><p> Also, the instructions were a bit vague at times. As an AFOL I had no problem, but I suspect that kids might have a tougher go at differentiating what needs to be done in each step, as it is not always that obvious. I have no idea what the recommended age group is for this set though. <br></p><p>If you like FLW buildings, then this is a really nice set to build and display. Playability is not really there in the architecture series. We all know that going in. But, the three sections of the roof are all removable, as is the 2nd story and as mentioned in a previous review, you can get some nice LED tea lights for the interior. I think that would be awesome and I plan to get some for my model.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3
"jarchitecture","2015-09-16T02:03:05.733Z","awesome model","<div class=""description"">
<p>This is an awesome set for sitting on your shelf or desk. For a Lego Architecture fan, this is a great set to get especially since it is the largest Architecture set so far.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Great instructions with nice pictures of easy to follow instructions. Also every now and then there are facts about the real building itself. The box is the largest Lego Architecture box so far and has the usual Lego Architecture opening box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a large selection of dark red tiles (especially 1x2 and 1x1 plates). There is not many colors besides dark red and light grey, but you get a lot of them. That is an advantage for building your own MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For me it took about four hours to build. It was nice building experience but it gets kind of annoying having to put so many 1x2 plates down. But it was nice to see it come together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is an awesome set when completed. The plates look just like bricks and the grey pieces make nice horizontal lines running throughout. The flower pots also add very nice detail to the house.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think it was a good price for this set and the overall building experience. If you are a Lego fan, architecture fan, or like Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s houses, I would advise getting this set. I would give this set 5 out of 5.</p>
