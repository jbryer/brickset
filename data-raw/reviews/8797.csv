"Legoless","2011-12-26T12:21:38.57Z","It will tempt you to the Dark Side","<p>Thanks to <em>Argos</em> and a system glitch that accidentally (and very much temporarily)&nbsp;made available&nbsp;the new Star Wars 2012 sets 3 weeks before the new catalogue launches, I was able to pick up this set and the new X-Wing (9493). So what better time than to attempt my first ever Brickset review: Here goes nothing...</p>
<h4>The Mini Figures</h4>
<p>I'll be honest, mini figures have never bothered me. Being an AFOL, i'm not actually playing with my sets, but I do understand the need to include them (apart from to justify the higher prices!). So with that in mind we are ""treated"" to&nbsp;3 rather nice figures (2 of which are new), and also an Imperial Officer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Star Trooper (New)</strong> - I have to admit, that he's pretty cool, mainly due to the fact that has has a two-sided head. On&nbsp;both sides he has a scowling expression and printed chin strap, but one side has him wearing cool shades (I guess that death star laser is quite bright!) 
<li><strong>R5-J2 (New)</strong> - A cool black astromech droid (who may or may not be evil, but he sure looks menacing) 
<li><strong>Tie Fighter Pilot </strong>- What I like about this figure is the fact that, even though&nbsp;his head is black, LEGO has seen sense&nbsp;enough to include a printed face. (This has the added bonus of, when helmet-less,&nbsp;making him look like an Imperial Ninja!) 
<li><strong>Imperial Officer </strong>- A pretty boring figure, but I guess someone's got to do the paperwork</li></ul>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>This is done in three sections: The centre cockpit area in one bag and a bag&nbsp;for each wing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cockpit </strong>- This was a fun&nbsp;build, but fairly straight forward. There is some great use of SNOT, with the end result being almost stud-free (something I prize in&nbsp;a model) 
<li><strong>The Wings </strong>- These are both genius in design, and suprisingly fun to build (despite the repetition&nbsp;of building two of them). For me the standout feature has to be the edging which again shows some clever SNOT thinking. Also,&nbsp;I must to point out that the&nbsp;designs in the centre of the wings&nbsp;are printed (in fact, there are no stickers in this entire set!).</li></ul>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This set looks impressive and very much like the ""real"" thing (that is to say, the ""imaginary"" thing that George Lucas dreamt&nbsp;up, but you know what I mean), and i'm actually not ashamed&nbsp;to say that it got a few swoops around&nbsp;my living room (Swooping's not playing, right?).&nbsp;It also has another quality that I prize in my sets, in that it's looks (more of less) in scale with the minifigures.</p>
<h4>Value for money</h4>
<p>At Â£49.99 this is quite expensive (suprise, suprise for a Star Wars set), but, in my opinion, totally worth it. The ingenuity that went into the design bodes well for the rest of 2012, and I, for one, can't wait.</p>

"CapnRex101","2012-01-01T14:43:27.93Z","9492 - TIE Fighter","<p>The TIE Fighter is one of the legendary ships from Star Wars, and this is the best representation of it by a huge distance. I was very excited when preliminary pictures of this set first surfaced on the Internet and now I have it in my hands, it has actually surpassed my already high expectations! The figures are excellent and the fighter is a delight, extremely accurate to the films and superbly detailed. The&nbsp;playability&nbsp;is great as well, with a couple of nice features and very sturdy construction so it will not fall apart on you like some of the older ones did.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is an odd shape, slightly taller than it is wide which I thought was a bit bizarre, but it still looks fantastic like the other boxes this year with the dark blue borders and awesome image of Darth Maul heading up the design, and a shot of all of the figures together on the right hand side. On the back the TIE Fighter is shown landed so they can show off the various features. This box also has the nice blueprint pictures of the ship from different angles like all of the other new Star Wars sets.</p><p>The instructions have the same new design as the box and there were no mistakes and I had all the pieces present and correct.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a huge number of very useful parts in this set. There are twenty-four black wedge plates! There are lots of grey slopes, several dishes and eight smooth black plates which are all useful for MOCing. But that's not all, there are twelve light grey rods which form the struts which cross the wings, and the brilliant new cockpit piece with some wonderful printing on it which is a perfect likeness for the ship in the films. We get a brand new hat piece for the Imperial Navy Trooper and of course the new conical head piece for the R5-J2 figure.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are four Minifigures in this set, a <b>TIE Fighter Pilot</b>, who is not a new figure but now has a face beneath his helmet like the new Sandtroopers and Stormtroopers. His torso has some printing of the life support pack and a belt, but he is almost entirely black like in the movie which makes him very menacing and imposing. The helmet is fantastic, just like it is on the pilot in set 8087, TIE Defender. <b>R5-J2</b> is a nice inclusion, with plenty of detail on the main body of the droid and the head. He is a background character in the Original Trilogy, but this Minifigure has really done him some justice at last! I love the gold plates on the top of his head and all the black tells us this droid is very&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;on the Imperial side.&nbsp;</p><p>The <b>Imperial Officer</b> is a figure they did not really have to include, but I am very pleased that they did as Imperial Officers are quite hard to come by in Lego, and are very useful characters for putting in MOCs. This is a newer version of the Imperial Officer with much more detailing on both the front and the back of his torso than ever before. He has six medals, a nice belt and on this occasion, black gloves, which makes them seem a bit more sinister. His face has an evil smirk on it, and he wears the same nice grey cap as always.&nbsp;</p><p>The best Minifigure in my opinion however is the <b>Imperial Navy Trooper</b>, he is very imposing in his almost entirely black uniform. His torso is the same as the Death Star Troopers included in set 10188, Death Star, and set 8038, the Battle of Endor and sadly has no back printing but his lovely helmet and face more than make up for that. His face is double sided, on one side he has a serious expression and a chinstrap, and on the other the same expression but with some awesome sunglasses! They are just like the goggles worn by the General Veers figure of old or the last AT-ST Driver but they look even better on this guy. His helmet is supremely detailed with all of the little buttons and the ventilation holes which you can see in the film and it fits well on his head, a problem which has plagued large helmets in the past, but not this time! He comes with a short blaster.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is good, it is a bit repetitive building the two wings but with any symmetrical vehicle that is the case so I am not going to mark it down for something so trivial. Beyond that there is a feast of brilliant building techniques used here, from the use of SNOT (studs not on top) on the edges of the wings, to the way they have now securely fitted the wings to the main fuselage. I also love how they have created the struts which cross the wings at awkward angles using hinges and those fabulous light grey rod pieces which are always so useful. The difficult shape of the cockpit has been pulled off as well by using many bricks which have been introduced since the last TIE Fighter model in 2005 to good effect. It took about an hour, but it was not too hard so I think parents would not need to help out younger children too much.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished, this TIE Fighter is significantly bigger than any we have seen before, about twenty-four centimetres from the top of the wing to the bottom. It is perfectly scaled with both the new X-wing and the Y-wing so perfect for recreating a space battle. There are two features, firstly, two red flick fire missiles below the cockpit which add a bit more playability to the set. Secondly, an opening cockpit, the way the cockpit opens is quite&nbsp;interesting. You can either open just the actual window piece if you want to have a look at the Pilot in there or you can open the entire cockpit roof by lifting the printed dish on the top as well which makes putting the Pilot in or taking him out much easier.&nbsp;</p><p>The best thing of all though is how sturdy this thing is. In the past TIE Fighters always had wobbly wings, it was in their nature! But now that is a thing of the past, these wings are very secure indeed! The wings are very&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;and in the centre there is a nice printed tile, which is good news for those of you who don't like stickers. Actually, there are no stickers in this set which is good. The inside of the cockpit is far&nbsp;improved&nbsp;from older incarnations of this ship &nbsp;with a seat and a control panel (which is actually just a red translucent grill piece).</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a set which should be very near the top of your wish list. It is simply excellent in every way and the price suddenly does not seem too bad either once you have actually seen the model in person. The set is flawless as far as I can tell so I cannot knock a point off for any reason which means I have to give it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Monty","2012-01-04T17:57:55.24Z","Good looks but expensive","<p>Before I bought this set I thought it was overpriced, but with its good looks and Christmas money to spend I thought I would spoil myself. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>It comes in a nice box which is of the type with a lift up lid which means you have to tear perforations at the back to get it to open.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The parts are in 3 bags - one for the cockpit and one for each radiator panel. I started by building the radiator panels. They are built up of smaller plates put together, but the build order could be better as it is a bit flimsy at times. As had been said by others, the build is a bit repetitive -&nbsp;by the time you have built both panels you will have built the same thing 4 times. By the end I could do it from memory, and also in a slightly different order to make it more stable earlier. This part of the build includes some new elements I have not seen before. One is a 4x1 tile with a stud at each end. The way in which these are used here means they could easily be replaced with a 2x2 tile and 2 2x2 plates at either side, which would have the added advantage of holding things together much better â still it is good to see new elements and they may be the only way in some future build, so I may replace them if I need to use them elsewhere. The other new element is on the top and bottom of the panels&nbsp;where there is a 2x6 plate with another 1x4 plate built in on top and the thick side of this then has 4 studs to enable the edge trim to be attached at right angles (SNOT) to the main plates making up the radiator panel. This gets stronger as it is built up and when the other details - including diagonal rods attatched with hinges and printed 2x2 round tile in the centre are added, looks superb and very accurate. It is larger than on previous TIEs and in proportion to the cockpit and body.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The cockpit and body is similar to earlier versions, but is made up with far more detail and sloping elements to give a better rounded appearance. The interiors use some odd bright colours again, but these cannot be seen from the outside when it is finished. The cockpit window frame is thankfully a printed element, but now&nbsp;it is rounded and does not contain built in studs for coloured laser canon bricks. Instead there are flick Missiles attached to the cockpit floor. The roof is also printed (no stickers in this set - good) â it looks the same as that used on the previous sets, but beware of the mistake in the instructions which tells you to put&nbsp;it on back to front! The construction is much stronger than before, you can now open and close the cockpit without it imploding. The attachment of the radiator panels to the cockpit element is also far sturdier than before. The 6x6 elements are there as are the Technic connectors, but there is also a cross axle and the whole thing snaps together well and the âTIE wobbleâ of previous offerings is gone. Also gone are the horrible blue plates used for the radiator panel detailing on previous TIEs. For appearance and strength this set is a major improvement on previous offerings and rates a maximum score. It deserves a worthy opponent, and it is a pity that apart from the UCS version, the latest X-Wing is not as accurate to prototype, as the new TIE. That said I have upgraded my older X-Wing by extending the wings to be in the correct proportion and added other details and the new TIE goes very well with it â you can see my modified X-Wing on my Brickshelf page.</p>
<p>There are 4 minifigs in the set â the pilot, Death Star Trooper , Imperial officer, and R5 J2 with the new cone shaped head which looks great. I suspect Lego is now well aware of the Minifig collecting frenzy especially Star Wars, but I could personally have coped with just the pilot as before, and a consequent reduction in price. Those who wanted the other figures could have bought them separately â I should not like to think people might buy this set just to get a unique Minifig as in my view it is well over priced for what you get anyway so for one Minifig it would be a high price to pay indeed.</p>
<p>You pay a premium for Star Wars sets and also for being one of the first to own them, but despite its superb appearance, and the Minifigs I still feel the set should have been 35 GBP tops rather than 50. If you can resist it may come down in price like other SW sets had to that were not selling, but if you are attracted by its good looks you may well crack like I did â itâs really up to the individual, but in my opinion it is not value for money compared to other recent purchases like 10220 the VW Camper.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2
"DrOrrery","2012-02-05T05:09:53.76Z","Swoooosh!","<p>While Lego has previously had some good versions of the X-wings, Y-wings, even Darth Vader's Tie Advanced, they have never really done justice to the simple old Tie Fighter. &nbsp;Until now.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No Stickers! &nbsp;This set has a handful of printed parts on the wings and on top of the cockpit. &nbsp;There are no stickers involved at all. &nbsp;After some bad sticker experiences with the Millenium Falcon, this is a welcome change.</p><p>There are three bags, the main body in one and the wings in the other two.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Quite a lot of grey and black as you would imagine, although for any pieces that are hidden they have tried to use some different colours. &nbsp;Quite a lot of repetition in pieces as well. &nbsp;Apart from the printed pieces, the main point of interest is the large cockpit bubble window.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The rest of this set is relatively simple, so to enhance it somewhat they have added some extra minifigs. &nbsp;I particularly like the droid, always nice to have a few of them around, although big helmet guy is also a bit different. &nbsp;The pilot now has a face underneath that huge flight helmet rather than a black sphere, and my very young son who loves pulling the hats off all the minifigs will be much less freaked out by this I'm sure.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is relatively simple, with the cockpit section built from the ground up. &nbsp;It is essentially a cube with two arms but they have done some interesting things with the slopes and studs not on top work on the arms. &nbsp;The wings are repetitive, doing the same thing 4 times essentially, but not dull. &nbsp;They build up quickly and there's no time to be bored.</p>
<h4>The completed model&nbsp;</h4><div>Firstly, it looks great. &nbsp;Although it's a very simple design, it's also fairly iconic and they've managed to get the look down nearly perfectly. &nbsp;The wings especially, and the grey borders are the crowning glory. &nbsp;There is a very slight gap between them and 4 of the six sides, but it's not immediately visible.</div><h4>Swooshability</h4><p>This gets its own section because, for this model, it's what it's all about. &nbsp;If you're 9 or 90, the first thing you're going to do after building this model is pick it up in one hand and fly it around your living room. &nbsp;It's perfect for that. &nbsp;Nice and solid, it can be held by the centre easily and it's even fairly safe to hold it by the wings. &nbsp;It'll even handle some knocks, about the only thing that seems an issue is the outer border, which occasionally breaks but is easy to repair.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>It's a great set. &nbsp;A bit expensive, probably one to get one sale, but the extra minifigs make up for that somewhat. &nbsp;If you've got the old x-wing or are getting the new one, your adversary is ready.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"cloaked7","2012-02-11T21:41:43.97Z","Reasonably priced SW set that is very playable.","<p>I should begin by saying this is my first review on brickset. &nbsp;I collect LEGOS, but don't play with them, so I don't build a lot of them. &nbsp;Also, I don't have much room to display them. &nbsp;Regardless, I wanted to build this set. &nbsp;Only the 2nd SW I've built. &nbsp;I usually build the houses and Technic sets. &nbsp;So, I'm not a SW expert, but hopefully my thoughts help out some.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1 - The look of the set. &nbsp;It's pretty big when finished. &nbsp;About 8 inches tall.</li><li>2 - I like the way the cockpit opens.</li><li>3 - Durable construction. &nbsp;</li><li>4 - Has a good swoosh factor. &nbsp;It is easy to hold, and since the wings are attached well there isn't a concern of it falling apart during a swoosh.</li><li>5 - I think the price per piece is good relative to other SW sets. &nbsp;I got mine for $42 on Amazon, and right after it came out. &nbsp;Right at $.10 a piece for a SW set that has 4 minifigs.</li><li>6 - No stickers!&nbsp;</li><li>â¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1 - The front and rear of each wing is the same and there are 2 of them, so you are doing a lot of the same construction 4 times. &nbsp;But, that's just the way it is with a 'plane' with wings.</li><li>2 - Would have been nice to have a 'star' minifig, but I'm not an expert on that, so not sure who that could have been.</li><li>â¦</li></ul>

"Aaron_Willing","2012-02-17T09:43:07.247Z","Spectacular Set, but Wait Until it Goes on Sale","<h4>Mini-figs<br></h4><p>9492 comes with four mini-figs: Death Star 
Trooper, Imperial Officer, TIE Fighter Pilot, and R5-J2. There really 
isn't anything new and exciting with either the Imperial Officer or the 
TIE Fighter Pilot. What I will say is that the pilot does come with a 
printed head underneath that helmet, similar to the sand troopers you 
get in 9490. Now, the Death Star Trooper is where it's at. His head is 
reversible, with goggles on one side and a scowling face on the other. 
But, the helmet is the main attraction with this mini-fig. It is a brand
 new mold and the amount of detail is perfect; Lego, well done. R5-J2 is
 one of three new R5 droids that Lego has released thus far. Each R5 
droid comes with a brand new conical head piece instead of the normal 
dome shaped heads we get with the R2 units, so it's a welcome change. 
R5-J2's body is simply a remake of R2-Q5's body, however, this is what 
he is supposed to look like. All of these mini-figs can be seen 
throughout the Original Trilogy, with the TIE pilot, Imperial Officer, 
and Death Star Troopers being seen in all three movies, and R5-J2 being 
shown briefly in the beginning scenes of Return of the Jedi aboard the 
Death Star 2. Overall, the mini-figs are a great addition to any Star 
Wars collection, with three of the four mini-figs being exclusive to 
this set.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Building 9492</h4><p>The build is 
similar to building any of the previous TIE Fighters, a bit repetitive. 
Yes, there are quite a few more pieces involved and a few more building 
techniques used, but the idea is the same: build the cockpit with arms, 
build the radiator panels/wings, attach together. Then again, what do 
you expect from a common TIE Fighter? Enough said, the building of this 
set was exciting throughout despite the repetitive nature of 
constructing the wings. I love the addition of SNOT techniques used, the
 slopes in the cockpit section, and the sheer amount of detail on the 
wings. Overall, the build was amazing... for a TIE Fighter.</p><p><br></p><h4>The Finished Set</h4><p>The
 old TIE Fighter wing wobble is virtually gone with this set because it 
is so well constructed. Speaking of which, the wings are indeed 
gorgeous. A very clever bordering technique is used for the wings, which
 makes use of hinged sections attached to the main wing; great! On each 
wing, there are six long bar pieces that really make the model look 
authentic. The addition of the binocular and printed circular pieces 
really ties the wings together. The cockpit is another beast altogether.
 Instead of the old TIE Fighter cockpit window piece, we get a new 
printed dome piece that is comb-hinged twice... and it will not implode 
on you when you open and close it. Inside there is not much to talk 
about. There is a typical dark grey mini-fig chair with a control panel 
that is lacking; it's only a red grill piece! On top of the cockpit you 
get your typical dark grey printed dish piece like you got on the old 
TIE Fighters. On the back there is three dish pieces, two light grey and
 one black, and two tiny red studs that show where the twin ion engines 
are located. The amount of slopes and SNOT features really bring out the
 authentic look that this set has. The only major problem with this set 
is the use of flick-fire missiles, which, by the way, don't work very 
well. TIE Fighters are not supposed to have missiles! If 
you do not use them as flick-fire missiles, they do look great as the 
laser cannons. Overall, the finished set is absolutely incredible and 
much larger than the older fighters.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Overall...</h4><p>There
 were no missing pieces, some extra pieces, and no clear errors in the 
building instructions. The box has the brand new Darth Maul logo on it 
with the back and front being very good at showing off the features and 
mini-figures of this set. There is a cool little comic at the back of 
the instruction manual like most of the sets for this year. The 
mini-figures you get with this set are fantastic, but only the TIE 
Fighter pilot is really necessary, however the addition of more is 
always welcome to me. Building is repetitive, but exciting. Flick-fire 
missiles are an annoying addition. The sheer amount of detail is 
awesome. Basically, this set eliminates the possibility of a Ultimate 
Collector's Series version in the future... yeah it looks that good! One
 major concern is the price: 50 euros or 55 dollars, ouch! The price is a
 huge rip-off and I would wait until 9492 goes on sale before 
purchasing.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Great mini-figures. <br></li><li>No stickers. <br></li><li>Overall detail on the cockpit and the wings. <br></li><li>New bubble cockpit window. <br></li><li>No wing wobbling.&nbsp;</li><li>Looks like a TIE Fighter should... no blue pieces.<br></li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Building the wings is repetitive. <br></li><li>Flick-fire missiles. <br></li><li>Sheer price will hurt your wallet.<br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3

"Snowtrooper119","2012-03-14T04:21:01.49Z","One of the best Star Wars vehicles yet","<p>The 2012 tie fighter in the simplest words is brilliant. It looks great and is movie accurate, has good swooshability, has nice minifigres and also has a great structural design. It is&nbsp;also very different to the two previous versions which had very similar designs and looks. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are four minifigures in this set, three of which are unnecessary. I think that this is good as it is nice to get extra&nbsp;minifigures. The redesigned&nbsp;tie pilot is a cool minifigure. The printing is simple but effective and the helmet is a great piece. This minifigure is similar to ones featured in previous sets but has a printed face instead of a plain&nbsp;brown or black head. The R5-J2 astromech droid is one of the first to include the new R5 style head piece which is really cool. The printing on the astro-droid is great and looks perfect roving along imperial corridors. The death star trooper is a redesigned version of the one included in 10188. It has a new, more detailed&nbsp;helmet and a double sided head. It is a cool minifigure and goes well with the set, it also serves the purpose of showing that this particular tie fighter is stationed on the Death Star. The imperial officer is my first but&nbsp;not&nbsp;a new&nbsp;minifigure.&nbsp;it is a good edition none the less, the detailing is just right and the officer's cap is great. </p>
<h4>TIE/in Starfighter</h4>
<p>Is aesthetically and structurally brilliant. The&nbsp;wings and the cockpit are very well made and not only look great but the connections are very strong and hardly wobble, unlike a certain tie crawler. The wings are well made and the new design features look great as well as the new colour scheme of grey and black. The cockpit is well made and the bubble window is a big improvement over the old one. The only thing I do not like&nbsp;are the flick-fire missiles as it doesn't look&nbsp;very good&nbsp;and tie fighters never had missiles in the first place.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This tie fighter is the best one yet. The only reason you should not buy this set is if you have decided you don't like it or you would rather buy 9493 X-wing. I recommend it to fans of star wars, spaceships, tie fighters, cool-looking sets and the Empire (Sar wars.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Chills","2012-12-10T13:13:12.44Z","A much improved TIE Fighter","<p>I've got each of the original TIE models, and I like the LEGO-y look to the models; I also like the use of blue on them. It make them look less serious and sinister. But those sets are flimsy and not very movie-accurate. So when this TIE Fighter came out I was curious to see what improvements LEGO made with it. I was not disappointed, this set is a huge step forward in design and accuracy. It's not perfect, but it is a really good set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off this version of the TIE Fighter is very movie accurate. The set is much larger than the previous one. In the movies the TIEs are not tiny, and neither is this set. It also uses the correct colors; all blacks and greys, no blue. The set definitely has the sinister feel of the movie TIE fighters.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The detail on this set is much greater. The wings don't just have grill-tiles for detail, they've got rods and plates, giving it a more 3 dimensional look. The edges of the wings are also plates held on with SNOT, giving the wings a thicker, more robust look. The connectors between the cockpit and wings are also more detailed, using SNOT to get the angles correct. The cockpit uses the new bubble canopy found on the Sith Interceptor and Rogue Shadow. I like how LEGO got away from the single canopy/laser piece. The lasers are flick-fire missiles, but they are well integrated so I don't begrudge LEGO for having them.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The ship is SOLID!. This is the biggest improvement over the previous design is how the wings/connectors/fuselage are held together. In the previous set they were joined by a couple of thin pins. Now the connectors are part of the fuselage, bricks and plates. The wings are held on with 2 thick technic pins and an axle. This makes the set swooshable and solid feeling. Kudos to LEGO for this. <br></li><li>Pro 4: The minifigures are great. You get a Death Star trooper with a real helmet (the helmets worn by the figures in the Death Star set are too small), a TIE pilot with real TIE helmet, an Imperial Officer, and an astromech droid. All are good figures to have in your collection.</li><li>Pro 5: The build was fun, and LEGO did well not to make it feel too repetitive; which is hard when it comes to the wings. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: A couple of details that were left out of the set that would have made it perfect: a better control panel in the cockpit (you get a transparent red grill plate... that's it!) and the rear of the cockpit ball should be concave with a small window, not convex like this set is.<br></li><li>Con 2: I would really like to see a better cap for our Imperial Officers. LEGO has made Star Wars accurate headgear for pretty much all the figures, but it still uses the Civil War-looking hats for the officers. Please create a new mold. :)<br></li></ul>
<p>This really is a great set. I grabbed a MISB one from ebay for well under RRP, so I think it is worth the money. Even if you get it for regular price this TIE fighter is still a great set. I can't wait for a new TIE bomber and TIE interceptor!</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4

A worthy opponent for the mighty X-Wing!","<p>I have to say, I really didn't like the look of this set when it was first revealed, and though I'm still not convinced about the new cockpit bubble (it's a bit bulbous) I have to say it is a really, really great set!</p><p>The level of SNOT is amazing - only 3 studs technically on top and another 8 on the sides of the main body make the measly 32 on the edges of the wings look excessive! And in a way you can't count the studs on the face of the wings as they're meant to be textured.</p><p>And I also didn't think the scaling was right from the pictures (I thought the wings were too long) but actually having built it I think it's spot on.</p><p><br></p><p>In terms of the previous versions there really is no contest - the previous TIEs have all been pretty ropey, blocky with awkard corners and 'diagonals' that look like they were drawn on windows 95 paint. This one is quite simply in a different league. It's smooth, sturdy, rightly proportioned, and most importantly, it isn't blue!</p><p>It is a slight shame though that it does somewhat dwarf Vader's TIE Fighter; they look a little comical next to each other. The TIE Interceptor isn't so out of place, provided you've swapped all its stupid blue bits for grey of course!</p><p><br></p><p>And just a little note if you've read other reviews that criticise the build: it's an engaging and satisfying build all through. The wings could be quite repetitive, but why not just build all the multiple parts at the same time? It's not that hard to figure out which bits you need to do 4 or 2 times, and not so repetitive if you do them at the same time. Or, you could build one or both wings first. Whatever you do, don't be put off, because it's not at all repetitive if you do it slightly out of order, and all the rest of it is a really rewarding build.</p><p><br></p>

<ul><li>Loads of SNOT!</li><li>Excellent looks - smooth, good proportions.</li><li>Sturdy build, very swooshable.</li><li>Engaging build with some pleasing moments.</li><li>Great set of figures.</li><li>It's grey! Hallelujah! It's grey!</li><li>Again, the looks! It's iconic! It's beautiful!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The price - as good as the figures are, it's tempting to eBay it for Â£25 without them and buy the mini Death Star to get a pilot!</li><li>This says more about its predecessors, but it dwarfs most other sets.</li><li>The bubble cockpit sticks out far too far and has a quite a bit that is left clear. Shame.</li><li>And another little point - this isn't a con, but I'm putting here to make a point... the TIE fighter didn't have missiles. Okay, granted. How do you suggest a laser should be represented in Lego? If it bugs you that much you could just, er, not fire them!</li></ul>
<p>An excellent set, it's absolutely beautiful and may, along with the Falcon (I want it!), X-Wing and Y-Wing (not so convinced these are all that special, or better than the last versions), be the beginning of another new era in the standard of Star Wars Lego.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3

"HikerCZ","2013-05-28T18:57:45.177Z","A real beauty in your space hangar","I cannot compare the new TIE with the older versions, so for me this one is the only real TIE. You don't have to be a scientist to see how design and technology have improved over the years at Lego. Only when you start building the ship's wings, you begin to realize how building techniques have changed and how clever and intriguing some of the solutions are (the edges of the wings or the struts for example). <br><br>I enjoy the design immensely and the ship is a real looker. The grey and black colour palette works perfectly in the SW environment and even though some fans might think this or that could be smoother or slicker, I find it appropriate for the Lego universe. And I believe you can sacrifice a bit of design for the sake of sturdiness, which is definitely the case here. So nothing falls apart and you can swoosh the ship around as much as you wish to.&nbsp; <br><br>The minifigs are great and plentiful for such a small set and any collector will appreciate them no doubt. The only problem I had with one of my sets was a bad printing of the astromech droid's head. Luckily Lego will send you a spare head if you complain as I did. Also a control panel similar to panels in any other SW craft would be nice, a red grill is really just a grill. <br><br>As other reviewers have pointed out, the build seems a bit repetitive but if you build the wings at the same time, it's much less frustrating. And yes, no stickers! <br><br>To sum up, I love my TIEs - from the moment I finished building the first one I knew I would buy more to have a real fleet. Now all I need is a new Darth Vader's TIE to have a real formation ready for a battle! I also managed to buy my ships for about 30 Euros each, so if you can make a bargain, just go for it.

"metao","2013-06-09T11:40:17.823Z","Looks great, but otherwise not very good.","<p>I'm normally one to post very positive reviews, but this is the worst set I have ever got from Lego. I think it was designed by a work experience kid. ""It's the simplest model ever, give it to the newbie to do"".<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box looks great. Instructions are fine, although as always I feel Lego could do a better job of indicating repetition up-front. Repetition was totally expected with this set, though.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In a word: Insufficient. I'll get there later. Lots of black and grey as you'd expect. Printed blocks instead of stickers = great. Could have used a proper control panel instead of the silly red brick, but I guess most people will display it closed anyway.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Excessive, but great if you're into this sort of thing. A pilot, which makes sense, and then two other dudes and a droid for which there is no place for on the model. As someone who cares not a fig for figs, the extra dudes just seem like an excuse to bump up the price.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Repetitive, as expected. Surprisingly fiddly, too. Easily done in less than an hour; this is not a set to while away a weekend.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks great. And it's very swooshable... as long as you're careful. This thing won't survive even the slightest drop test. And this is my problem with the set - the wings are only 2 flat bricks thick in most places, with only rudimentary reinforcement. The edging is done very cleverly, but as a result is quite delicate. Now, this may have been intentional - possibly the shattering of the wings when you drop is designed to protect the pilot hub connection point pieces from actually shearing, resulting in broken pieces rather than a broken model. But the final result - to a practiced eye - actually looks poorly engineered. The thin-ness of the wings also looks to be too thin for canon, so there was really no reason not to make the wings thicker and stronger.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It looks great, but for this price I expect more than that. For what you get, this set goes way beyond what's justified by the ""licensed property tax"". It needed a few more pieces in a more robust wing design that would both look a little bulkier and be physically stronger.<br></p><p>A few MOCs have been published to create a TIE Interceptor using only

"Packer_221","2013-08-12T10:22:21.59Z","A Great Addition To Your Tie Collection","<p>I saw this set at half off at Shopco for $35 and I had just gotten money from my Grandma, so I jumped at the deal (their retail for the set was $70!). This was also a great set for me because I have started collecting Tie Fighters. So far I own Darth Vader Tie Advanced, Tie Defender, Tie Intercepter, and obviously, the Tie Fighter. I still need the Tie/D Fighter, Tie Bomber, and the Tie Crawler. The retail price for this set is $55, has 413 pieces, and is recommended for ages 8-14.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<div>The box for this set has the same design as any other set from this wave, with the glossy finish, minifigs up the side, and a rather angry picture of Darth Maul with an ignited lightsaber up in the right hand corner. The shape for the box is square, but not a surprise figuring the model itself isn&#39;t very long and short, but more of a square shape. On the side it lines up all four of the minifigs in this set, but only two of them being labeled &#39;new&#39;. All of the figures are in fact new, and I am not sure why TLG has not labeled them correctly. It certainly would be better business for them. The two figures not labeled correctly are the Imperial Officer and the Tie Fighter Pilot. The officer has more detailed printing and black gloves and the Tie pilot has the new printed Imperial trooper head. Here are links to the figs I was comparing them to:&nbsp;</div>

<div><img src=""webkit-fake-url://79EFCA3D-A101-4F7C-B273-79CE1DD88FDE/imagejpeg"" /></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p><img src=""webkit-fake-url://4D48808C-670C-4F00-88D7-D74ABAC666FF/imagejpeg"" /></p>

<p>Again, these are not the figs in the set, but these are the ones TLG said are the same figures that come in the set. I just find it strange that Lego would make such a mistake. you can see the sets they come in at the bottom left of the pictures and neither of them say 9492. These figures are the latest versions of the figs before this set came out, so it is obvious that these are Lego&#39;s idea of the figures in the set. So, enough with that, lets move on the the picture. On the box it displays the Tie Fighter in flight, with on flick missile shot out. In the background you see the first Death Star and two random explosions. The instruction manual is quite large in size, measuring 20 x 27.5 centimeters, just making it more vulnerable to be folded inside the box, which is exactly what happened. All you have to do to get it straight is to bend the folds in the opposite direction they&#39;re in and after a few tries it&#39;ll become straight. The book also has 42 pages and a checklist for most minifigures for the wave in the back.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>You get a lot of good parts in this set, mostly being light-bluish grey plates/hinges and black plates. You also get your classic Tie 4x4 printed radar dish that&#39;s been used ever is since the first Tie Fighter. Probably the most valued piece in this set is the hinged dome piece with Tie cockpit printing. I imagine this piece will go high on Bricklink being aimed at Tie collectors who want to update their Ties. Another inclusion is two 2x2 round plats with printed (that&#39;s right, printed, not a sticker) Imperial markings on them. You get 12 street lamp pieces, too. Overall there are a lot of pieces in this set that will please Star Wars fans.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<div>You get four minifigures in this set, with all of them being new. First up is R5-J2. His body is the same as the other Imperial astromech droids&#39;. He features the new astromech droid head with that sort of half cone shape. On it he features two &#39;eyes&#39; and gold printing on the top. Not a too exciting figure, but will be great to add to scenes aboard Imperial space stations.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Next up is the only figure needed in this set, the Tie Fighter Pilot. He has the same torso as the first ever Tie pilot featuring a life support with blue accents and no back printing. Like I said before, his head is the new printed Imperial trooper head. His helmet has the Empire&#39;s logo on the top and has extra dark-bluish grey highlights on parts of it. Basically the only thing this figure is good for is piloting the Tie fighters. Again, not a too exciting figure, but essential to the set</span></h4>

<div><img src=""webkit-fake-url://56552FD5-AAC8-4468-96BD-082DEA8350DD/imagejpeg"" /></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our third figure is the Imperial Officer. On his torso he features a black belt, two communicators at the top, and status markings showing he is a low ranked officer. On the back it continues his belt. His head has a smirk, but why he is smiling is a mystery to me, with the Death Star being about to be blown up and all. On his head he wares a dark-bluish grey kepi. This will be a nice addition to your Imperial army and scenes.</span></h4>

<div><img src=""webkit-fake-url://BE94A331-FD13-4EC6-9618-B6182C6CD71D/imagejpeg"" /></div>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The final and best figure in my opinion is the Death Star Trooper. He has the same torso as the ones in the Death Star, with a black belt and silver pouches to house ammunition and supplies. There is no back printing. His head is double sided, both with angry expressions and chin straps, but one has a black visor. This figure is the first to have this head, also used by General Veers and the AT-ST driver. The best part about this figure is the helmet. It&#39;s a brand new mould and is a HUGE improvement from the black Hoth Imperial Officer helmet. It looks exactly like it should and I&#39;m very happy with it. This is an excellent figure.</span></h4>

<div><img src=""webkit-fake-url://08B80EC8-ABBC-4A06-8FA5-AF6B359E3CA0/imagejpeg"" /></div>

<h4>The build</h4>

<div>For the build there are three numbered bags. The first one builds the cockpit and the second and third ones build the solar panel wings. The cockpit is very fun to build. With the roof piece overlap technique. The wings are also a good build even though you have to do it twice. They used a new technique for building the Tie wings making them thicker with edges to them, which was very fun to build. It wasn&#39;t the best build ever, but it was satisfying.</div>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<div>The completed model looks very sleek. A lot of snot techniques were used to make it look appealing. There are two flick-fire missiles below the cockpit and the cockpit opens on two hinges giving easy access. The back engine uses three radar dishes, one 6x6, one 4x4 and one 2x2. The 2x2 one is surprisingly in black, where it is usually trans. blue for flight mode. What really sticks out for me are the new wings. They look very appealing with the light-bluish grey trim. Overall this is a great model to add to your tie collection. Only get it if its on sale. $55 is way to much. If you have are an adult and have the money, it&#39;s okay. But if your a young fan looking to save money you should wait, because it&#39;s not worth $55. Besides that this is a great set.</div>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-05-21T06:52:10.283Z","Excellent TIE Fighter","<p>So I&#39;ve never purchased a TIE Fighter because they are always so expensive, but it was really bothering me that I never had one so I decided to start looking for a bargain and I finally found this one for just under $50 which seemed acceptable as the newer ones keep getting more and more expensive and I&#39;m not really interested in the triangular Sith version out now. While it seems a little too simple for the price I paid, the completed model more than makes up for the price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>So the parts are probably the least exciting thing about this set. Yes, you get some large plates with studs only around the edges, a ton of angle plates, and those gray beam things whatever you call them. But there also aren&#39;t any stickers in this set which is truly awesome and the printed parts look great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>So you probably aren&#39;t buying this set for the minifigures, but the 4 minifigures you get in this set are quite good. I do like that they are all with the empire as it wouldn&#39;t make sense to have a single rebel take on a TIE Fighter (this of course is pre-Rise of Skywalker). I also like that none of them are stormtroopers, because let&#39;s face it, you probably already have 100 stormtroopers. So first up you get the TIE pilot who is clearly the most crucial minifigure in this set. He does look great and I do like that he has a black head with a printed face. Next up is an Imperial Officer, and while he may be generic, he looks good and is a very welcome addition to my minifigure collection. Then comes a Death Star trooper which I suppose informs you about where this TIE Fighter happens to be based. These guys aren&#39;t too common so also a nice addition. Finally you get a black astromech droid who I believe is unique to this set and certainly wouldn&#39;t be out of place on any ship in the imperial navy or the Death Star. So even though you probably won&#39;t buy this set for the minifigures, you will be happy you have them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Build</p>

<p>The build is broken out into 3 bags. Bag 1 is the cockpit and minifigures, while 2 and 3 are identical and each build a wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 1 is a fairly standard build, nothing revolutionary, but fun. It is pretty much just standard stacking with a tiny bit of very basic technic where the wings will attach. While it is symmetrical, it is still a fun build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bags 2 and 3 I did together. So you are building 2 identical wings that are symmetrical on both the x and y axis, so this going to be repetitive and you really can&#39;t blame Lego for that, it&#39;s how these fighters are designed. Luckily these come together very fast so it isn&#39;t a tedious process. Of course that speed is due to how incredibly flimsy these wings are. I would say about half the surface area is a single plate thick, and except along the horizontal axis and in the center, everywhere else is only 2 plates thick. As you assemble this thing it feels incredibly fragile. When you combine the two halfs they are connected by a single stud at the top and the bottom, but surprisingly it is enough. Eventually you will reinforce these connections, but not with much. That said, it is enough and I really do appreciate how flimsy they are yet how strong they are, it&#39;s kind of like the real thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The only difficult part of the entire build is at the very end, and not because it is tricky, but it is just difficult to snap the bricks together. This is when you add the large 4x4 brick with the inverted roof tiles protruding from the top and it is attaching to 9 different bricks all at once. I kind of think that Lego should have made the instructions in reverse and started with this brick rather then end with it, although I do realize you would then have an axel sticking out the bottom throughout the entire build of each wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Model</p>

<p>The completed model looks great. Yes the inside of the wings are lackluster, but the outside of them looks great and draws your eyes attention away from the far wings inside. Yes, the cockpit isn&#39;t perfectly round, but given how impossible that is to do with Lego, I think they did a fantastic job. While I believe that only the top of the cockpit should open, I. This model the top opens along with the front windshield which is attached to it. This is definitely a good thing as it would have been impossible to fit a minifigure inside if only the top opened. However, it might have been nice if the windshield attached to the bottom and opened down out of necessity of needing to fit your fingers into it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>So you really only get one play feature, a pair of flick fire missiles on the bottom. Obviously this is all you could really expect from a TIE Fighter, however they are red and a TIE Fighter should fire green. Then again. the red looks good and I think green would have looked out of place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More importantly is how well you can fly this thing, and the answer is perfectly. This is far and away the easiest Star Wars Lego ship to hold. It is amazingly sturdy given how flimsy the wings are. It also is fairly easy to remove the wings when it gets shot down by a rebel fighter. It&#39;s simple to land as its wings create a large flat surface. All around, this thing was designed to be played with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only issue as far as playability goes is how large this is in comparison to a X-wing or Y-wing and especially the Millenium Falcon. But I suppose that is really a problem with the other ships being too small, there is a reason why you want this set and not a microfighter.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I absolutely love this set and do appreciate that it is in the traditional color scheme of the original trilogy. Yes, the set has a few drawbacks, but overall it&#39;s a wonderful set. It is also very big so you will feel like you are getting a lot for your money and would look great on display for the times you aren&#39;t playing with it. While I typically want to have an exciting build, this is a set that makes up for a fairly boring build in every other way possible. I highly recommend this set if you love Star Wars. After&nbsp;all, this arguably the most recognizable ship in the galaxy!</p>

It gets a little repetitive when you build the wings but its not that bad. The minifigures are good and this is a great set to get if you have the X-Wing as well so tha you can make them dogfight. I would highly recommend this set to those who like Star Wars.</p>
