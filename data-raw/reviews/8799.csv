<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p>This set is extremely small. If you missed it, it has less than 8 pieces. Even with that, this exclusive set is great to put on your fridge or anything as memorabilia. It&#39;s fun and simple. You can tinker around with the arms, legs, and everything for a bit and still not get overly bored.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building/Finished Product:</strong></p>

<p>Yes! This took me so&nbsp;long to build! Anyways, the set is alright. Nice exclusive pieces and nice figure. I would recommend if you&#39;re able to get it, pretty neat.</p>
