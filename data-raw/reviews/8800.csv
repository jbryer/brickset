No-one in the house could believe it.<div><br></div><div>My own achievements aside, the Graduate is a wonderfully unique Minifigure that captures the spirit of earning your most important qualification to date, and entering the world of work after years of hard graft. The facial expression sums it all up and is a piece of art in its own right - the huge grin that will be fixated for photographs and celebration.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In many respects, I actually feel this could be a Minifigure that will largely be appreciated by older fans, as the graduation ceremony is an event which you simply have to experience for yourself in order to accept for its jubilation. Thats not to say that the younger community won't like this Minifigure, but I just think some parties will love it more than others.</div><div><br></div><div>His robe requires some folding in order to keep it flat (this is standard for some 'cape' designs) but this isn't too much trouble with delicate fingers. The Mortar-board is another unique item that is simple but highly detailed, and the Certificate of Graduation brick could actually be more versatile than you may think...</div><div><br></div><div>Its a straight 4-Stars for me - only missing out on 5 because the 'Certificate' can be a little awkward to 'grasp' in the Minifigures hand - particularly without creasing the robe too. However, this is not unique to this set as plate style bricks are known to be difficult to 'grasp'.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"CapnRex101","2011-08-10T17:59:43.93Z","8805 (1) - Graduate","<p>I have now got my hands on the lovely Series 5 Collectable Minifigures, and they are just as good as (if not better than) the previous 4 Series. The first of them is the Graduate, a fun figure, not the best but still really nice.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts with this figure are great, this is one of the most detailed Minifigures of the Series I think. Of course the biggest draws are the&nbsp;Mortarboard&nbsp;hat, the gown and the printed diploma tile, and with good reason!</p><p>As it is the pick of the parts for me I will start with the hat, it is wonderful! I love the slanted angle at which it adorns the figures head, and it looks almost&nbsp;identical&nbsp;to the real thing which is fantastic. It is obviously black with the&nbsp;tassel&nbsp;hanging from the iconic square part of the Mortarboard, and I think this piece has been a long time coming.</p><p>The head is not bad at all, with a huge grin and brilliant detail in the creases under his eyes, the face overall really demonstrates the delight of the character (at least when he gets his diploma) and I quite like it. However it is far from unique, and there are many head pieces similar to this, but still, very nice.</p><p>The gown I really like, it is black and I think is a new shape, with a complete trapezium shape at the back, and a cut out area from the trapezium at the front to show off the jumper! It is, needless to say made of a fabric, and may be useful for creating a sort of&nbsp;trench coat&nbsp;look for a figure.</p><p>The torso is also quite good, it is just black with a small area of shirt and tie showing at the top, giving the look of a jumper, which is brilliant, this piece could be very useful for making your own&nbsp;Minifigures. He also features black arms of course, which could be swapped out to give a sleeveless jumper!</p><p>The legs and belt are just plain black with no printing, this is fine though as unless you want pleated trousers this is perfectly accurate. If you do want pleated trousers, I think that would be going a bit far on the detail, it would probably look like he had spilt something very precisely down his trousers.</p><p>But the diploma tile is absolutely perfect, no expense is spared with&nbsp;fantastically&nbsp;detailed printing! The design is printed on a white two by two tile and has scrolling detail, lots of writing including a legend that reads 'Certificate Of Graduation' and even a red rosette at the bottom!</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Summary</span></p><p>In my opinion this is one of the figures from this Series which fades into obscurity, it is far from the best or the worst but this is less the fault of this figure and more of the incredibly good figures which make it to the top of the list! Anyway, this Minifigure could be very useful for MOCs and I would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;advise anyone to purchase this! At least if you can find it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"AETerry","2011-09-05T11:29:18.733Z","Graduate Review","I'm a little ho-hum after finding and getting this minifigure from a pack. With this figure I'm just not feeling the excitement from it like I have other figures. Still, it is a good little figure and I'm sure there will be others out there who love it, especially someone who's a recent Graduate themselves.<br><br>Despite my ho-hummedness with this figure, he's got some very good detailing. The mortar style hat is very well molded and detailed. The cape (which requires folding) is also good, adding to the torso print underneath with a print of a black sweater over a suit &amp; tie. Then the little flat 2x2 tile piece with the Certificate of Graduation print on it. <br><br>In the end, I think he will be a figure that's used for MOCs or sits with the rest of the Minifigure Collection for display. Other than that, he doesn't really stand out as an exciting figure to have. So I hope that explains my choices of ratings. ",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3
"LEGOSLUG","2011-10-26T22:49:30.95Z","My Certificate of Graduation! Mum will be pleased!","<p>Here is my review of the set 8805-1 Graduate.<br>To start off, the cape is annoying, and you need to bend it for it to sit properly on the torso.</p><h4>The Minifigure:</h4><p>The&nbsp;male Graduate&nbsp;is a great minifigure, because you can actually change the head to a female figure, if you have a spare head. Nice printing on the torso as well, and as a bonus, a Printed Tile with a Certificate of Graduation on it. The minifigure can hold on to the Certificate of Graduation, and looks quite good when it does. The minifigure comes with a stand as well, and looks really good when put with other minifigures.<br></p><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>A great minifigure. Worth trying to get it,&nbsp;I got it my the old feeling the bags trick. It really is good, so are the other minifigures, so if you don't&nbsp;get it,&nbsp;ah well, but if you do, awesome. 5/5<br><br>LEGOSLUG<br><br>P.S. Please take a look at my other reveiws, and my bricklists.<br></p>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
"The_Reviewer","2011-12-13T12:40:30.1Z","Nice","<p>When I first saw pictures of series 5 this was one of my favorites and I had to get this one. The graduate comes with a tile piece with a&nbsp;printed&nbsp;certificate of graduation, a&nbsp;black&nbsp;robe that is a&nbsp;hard to make it straight&nbsp;to where it looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;on the image,and&nbsp;he comes with a&nbsp;flat graduate's hat. The torso is like a black sweater with a red tie inside. His face has a cheerful expression with smile</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to determine (Feel for the tile certificate) 
<li>Uniqe (How often do we see a graduate in lego?) 
<li>â€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lacks Playability (there is not much you can do with it) 
<li>
<li>&nbsp; Overall this is a unique minifig, Find it if you can.</li></ul>

"Graysmith","2012-01-14T13:57:33.97Z","Get It For The Torso!","I had no intention at all to get this one, but after collecting all the minifigures from Series 5 that I'd really wanted I took a second look at the ones I'd passed on and that's when I noticed what a fantastic torso this graduate has. <i>""But it's just a normal, ordinary person torso"",</i> you say. <i>""What's so fantastic about that?""</i><br><div><br></div><div>Here's why. There's an enormous lack of nice ordinary person torsos in the City theme. This, of course, has to do with LEGO mostly just releasing sets with police, criminals, firefighters and repairmen in them and very few sets with ordinary citizens. On top of that, of those that do exist only a few feature nice torsos and most often the really nice ones are of the more dressy kind, like business suits and such. Basically, there's a real lack of the ""casual wear"" kind of torsos that this graduate minifigure provides. The fact that it's a black torso makes it even better too since you can combine it with just about every colour/accessory and it'll still look good (unlike the similar but hideously green torso in <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=4435-1"">this set</a>).</div><div><br></div><div>As for the minifigure as a whole? It's not bad at all. The robe is rather flimsy and easily my least favourite part about it, but he comes with a nice happy face, some nice dark grey pants (also very useful/versatile) and the diploma could look quite nice hanging on the wall of a house or an office too. So even if you were to buy it just for the torso, there's still good value in the other pieces included.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bottom line</b>: This graduate quite honestly comes with the nicest, most useful torso of this style that LEGO has <i>ever</i> made. I'm already thinking of getting a few more of these graduates just because of the torso, and I can only hope LEGO will re-use it for regular City sets in the future. They'd be absolutely crazy not to.</div>",TRUE,4,4,2,2,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T20:38:59.427Z","And now your Class Valedictorian.","<p>Set #8805 Graduate: The Graduate is a Mini-Figure I could take or leave, but I find him to be pretty darn cool for a Collectible Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure from Series 5 comes with some wonderful new pieces and an interesting design, his facial print is a big happy smile with proud looking eyes, he's glad to be graduating. The hat is one of the best MOC parts to be given out in one of these sets. The torso print is a great looking sweater and tie number that could be very useful in any number of MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He comes with a nice tile printed with a diploma as well, however the black cloak piece he comes with is difficult to get to flatten out against his torso. It is a minor complaint though, I'd still say this is one of the must-have Mini-Figs from Series 5 for MOCers and Mini-Fig collectors alike.</p>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-04-02T16:01:22.557Z","a GREAT figure!","<p>The first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Graduate. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that excellent graduation cap piece, and that piece was new for the figure, which is great. I love that piece so dang&nbsp;much, with the pointy top, the rounded bottom, and the little tassel to the side is great as well. I do wish that tassel had yellow printing, because it kind of gets lost in the black, but it&#39;s nothing some paint or maybe even a yellow sharpie can&#39;t fix up. It&#39;s still a fantastic part, and I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s appeared in any more sets.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has an amazing print. That face is extremely expressive, and I&#39;m in love with his big, chipper smile. I also love the wrinkles beside the eyes. He has no alternate expression, which is good since it&#39;d be totally exposed.</p>

<p>Next is that cloth piece, which actually adds so much to the figure. That looks great, with the two strands hanging down in front of the torso, and the figure wouldn&#39;t say &ldquo;graduation&rdquo; if it weren&#39;t for it.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which is also pretty sweet. It has some very nice printing, with the red tie, as well as the white undershirt, and there&#39;s even some wrinkle printing under that cloth piece. No back torso printing, though.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have no printing. However, it&#39;s very interesting how they&#39;re caste in a dark grey instead of black, like the torso. I think that works better than black legs would, because then it&#39;d just be too much black.</p>

<p>And last but not least is that 2x2 print of the diploma.I love how that looks, with the &ldquo;certificate of graduation&rdquo; print, and the figure would be incomplete without it as well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, this is definitely&nbsp;one of my favourites in this series, which is saying something because this is one of my favourite series&#39; ever. All the figures in it are fantastic, and this is no exception. The hat, face, torso, the grey legs, everything about this is so fantastic. And this is one of the most original ideas for a CMF ever, if you ask me. Just everything about this guy is awesome, and he&#39;s a 5 out of 5 for me. But I must say, he isn&#39;t worth three dollars, like most in the series. Still, this is great.</p>

<p>And as always, thanks for reading!</p>
