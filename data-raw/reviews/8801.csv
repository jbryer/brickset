"POWERCARTOON_","2011-08-24T13:15:46.78Z","Fantastic minifigure!","<p>This is a must have minifigure for many&nbsp;reasons , i will list all these below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS: <strong><em>The Helmet</em></strong> (One of the best Lego helmet pieces iv'e ever seen)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Sword</em></strong> (It's a new&nbsp;version but&nbsp;not the coolest)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Right arm detail</em></strong> (Fantastic printed&nbsp;decal for a great figure)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS:Not really any , he looks like a gladiator and there's nothing missing from him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll be using this minifig in one of my animations because he's so cool!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest just to get one , as a group they will all look like clones ( and&nbsp;Gladiators dont all look like each other!)</p>
<p>The Gladiator also goes great with the Spartan since they were both in the same time period in history.</p>

"xccj","2011-08-31T03:14:17.03Z","The Gladiator","<p>The Gladiator is certainly an interesting figure in Series 5.&nbsp; He comes with new pieces, great printing, and an overall ""I will fight to the finish"" look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, let's cover the new and interesting&nbsp;pieces.&nbsp; The sword is new, with a straight blade and a handle with a curved end.&nbsp; I personally love the design.&nbsp; (Okay, it could be a bit longer, but maybe it's supposed to be more historically accurate.)&nbsp; The shield is not a new mold (it came with the Spartan and Viking) but this is the first time it's seen in gunmetal grey.&nbsp; But what really stands out is the metallic gold helmet.&nbsp; This thing is huge, with lots of detail in the design, from the top curve to the face mesh.&nbsp; It's not the most appealing piece ever, but I could easily see it used on some custom evil-space robot fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other minifig parts also have some great printing on them.&nbsp; The legs feature what I guess are shorts, boots, and lots of armor.&nbsp; Quite a lot was printed on them.&nbsp; You also have some decent armor printing on his torso, and to top it off his right arm also has armor printing on it.&nbsp; The detail is just amazing.&nbsp; He also has an angry stubble face, but it is almost entirely hidden when wearing the helmet, so it's not that important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finding Him</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking for this fig by feeling the bags, there are two ways you could go.&nbsp; First of all, you could go for the sword.&nbsp; It's small and easy enough to isolate, and it has a distinct shape that sets it apart from any of the other pieces included with the other figs.&nbsp; Additionally, you could try feeling for the helmet; it's massive, so it's easy to locate even if you can't feel out all the ridges.&nbsp; For best results, look for both the helmet and sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the parts and overall look, I can see this as being one of the more sought after minifigs of Series 5.&nbsp; He's not my personal favorite, but I can't deny that he comes with some great pieces.&nbsp; He'll be a good addition for any one's minifigure collection.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Shistavanen_brick","2011-11-29T18:03:07.89Z","Pax vobiscum (or maybe not, really).","<h4>The minifigure.</h4><div>This little guy has tons of detail. He has one of the toughest faces in LEGO warrior history and I am happy that LEGO took some time to pay attention to details with this one. Many of the historic minifigs are in fact very detailed and quite accurate (apart from the horn-helmet Viking). The printing on legs and arm are sweet.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, the big draw is the cool helmet. It looks just grand and has a nice bronze colouring to it. His small Roman Gladius sword is cool, quite sharp at the end, actually. What I find a bit disappointing is the plain shield. I get it, that it's perhaps cheaper and simpler to include a ""normal"" shield. However, the gladiator would have looked a bit sharper if he had a more detailed shield to go with the detailed helmet, body and the cool sword. That's about my complaint, really. Otherwise it's just an A1 this figure, this.</div><div><br></div><h4>An idea.</h4><div>Included in this bag is the sword and the helmet, which will be your key things to look for if you are feeling your way through the bags. That trick provided me with 4 of these guys (not to mention they were almost 25% cheaper) to be placed onto my&nbsp;shelf&nbsp;of&nbsp;historic LEGO. One thing you could do to MOC a little is to use the trident from the Atlantis sets and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8073-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8073-1</a>&nbsp;is just a tip.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading, cheers!</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><p></p><ul><li>The detailing on the entire figure.</li><li>Amazing helmet!</li><li>The best one from series 5!</li></ul><p></p><p>Cons:</p><p></p><ul><li>Should have (though it negates the purpose of the series-bags) come with TWO gladiators in the same bag.</li></ul><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"Snowtrooper119","2011-12-10T20:34:06.82Z","The best of the best","<p>When I first saw the gladiator I knew that it was one of the must-have minifigures of series 5. With the incredible helmet and other detailing I knew it would be brilliant and might rival the spartan warrior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Accessories</h4>
<p>The sword is a new mold and represents the period better. It is a dark grey colour that is the same colour&nbsp;as dragon knight helmets and looks really cool. The shield is the same colour as the sword and is the same mold as the spartan warrior. The helmet is the best part of the minifigure. It has an incredibly detailed mold&nbsp;with shiny&nbsp;bronze colouring that makes this helmet very striking. The accessories for this minifigure are great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Head</h4>
<p>The head is&nbsp;well detailed&nbsp;shows a concentrated face with lots of stubble and a growing moustache. It helps make the gladiator's character perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Torso</h4>
<p>The torso shows straps and a big belt that goes arcross his waist. Also it shows parts of his bare chest. When I built this minifigure one of the things that surprised me was the armour on his right arm. This minifigure has plates of armour on his right arm that look fantastic and again, helps build the character. Unfortunately there is no back printing and it just shows a bare back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legs</h4>
<p>The legs show some boots and pants that would have been worn back in the day with good detailing. There is not much to talk about them except that they need the torso to look good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This minifigure is well worth hunting for among the sea of collectible minifigures. It is my favourite minifigure at the time of writing. I recommend it to fans of collectible minifigures, gladiators and lego warriors in general.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"Rockman_Xtreme","2012-02-10T17:46:35.79Z","Time to Kill that pesky arena lion...","<p>One word: AWESOME. It would be cool to get <em>two</em> in a packet though as someone else said...</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1. Awesome helmet!</p>
<p>2. Pointy sword</p>
<p>3. Cool face, to match the fact he's probably going to fighting lions in a MOC</p>
<p>4. Armor (printed)&nbsp;on legs, body, and arm!</p>
<p>5. Goes good with history MOCs</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>1. Needs shield printing</p>
<p>2. Gladiator sandals printed on legs?</p>

"AETerry","2013-03-11T17:52:56.13Z","Gladiator Review","This is one of those minifigures that when it came out, I didn't like it and it took a while to grow on me before I had to acknowledge I do like it.<br><br>Simply as a historical figure, it is very well done with the sculpting for the specialized helmet and the print job for the torso and legs. The accessories of sword and shield compliment this figure and round it out very well.<br><br>Maybe it was the helmet. I don't know. But I do find myself ultimately liking this figure after all and at $2.99 for the original retail price, that's not bad. Perfect for all the collectors and MOCers looking to do historical scenes. Glad I hung onto the couple I have instead of trading them off as I use them now in my collection of minifigures.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-03T03:07:20.46Z","a REVOLUTIONARY figure!","<p>The second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Gladiator. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that amazing mask piece, which is the best part of the figure. That piece was very new to the figure, and it&#39;s amazingly complex for 2011. I actually want to break down all its details, so we can appreciate all its complexity. So first, we have the holes on the front of his mask, which looks like they were a pain to mould. I also love how that lip hangs down from the holes. That fin on top looks sweet as well. Also, the colour its caste in is brilliant, being that slick and shiny metallic gold colour. That looks so gorgeous, if you ask me, and all around, that mask is my favourite part of this whole figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, and you can&#39;t see it in this picture due to the mask, so you&#39;ll have to take my word for it. He has a very angry expression, with some barred teeth, and he also has a black stubble. It is a very expressive face, and I love how LEGO put lots of detail into something that isn&#39;t barely even seen.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms. That torso has some really cool printing, with the brown armour, and the straps look good as well. I also love the yellow muscles under it all. Unfortunately, he has no back torso printing, which really stinks, if you ask me. But there is one detail that I really love. The arm holding the sword actually has some very nice armour printing on it! Normally I would be disappointed that the other arm has none, and I am a little. But on the other hand, it is accurate to real gladiators to have armour on one arm, so that&#39;s pretty cool, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some pretty cool printing as well. I love how the brown armour printing carries from the torso down into the legs, and I also like how some yellow skin is showing. He has a tad bit of side leg printing, being some yellow flesh, but I kind of wish he had more side printing. Oh, well.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessories, which are both awesome. That shield is pretty cool in its dark grey colouring, however I do wish it had printing. That sword looks great as well, but don&#39;t be fooled by that image; it&#39;s completely caste in dark grey, so the picture is pretty inaccurate, with the silver printing that simply isn&#39;t on the real thing. It actually looks a little bad in real life, but it&#39;s nothing a silver sharpie can&#39;t fix up.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, this is a really great figure for 2011. Again, I love almost every figure in Series 5, so it isn&#39;t much surprise that I love this figure as well. The printing all around him is pretty good, and his accessories aren&#39;t bad either; but the best part of this figure by far is that very amazing mask piece. That piece would be cool to get nowadays, but it was even more revolutionary in 2011. So all in all, while, like all other Series 5 CMF&#39;s, it may not be worth three dollars, it&#39;s still a fantastic figure.</p>

<p>And as always, thanks for reading!</p>
