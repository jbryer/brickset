","This is a beaut little minifig from the new CM series 5 - looks smart and i can see it being a target for all the army builders out there. <br><br>Only 5 peices in this set, but the hat is a brand new mould and quite unlike any other minifig headpiece - i'm sure MOC'ers will find plenty of new uses for it. In addition, the torso printing provides a welcome alternative to the usual redcoats from the pirates theme. The rifle in a colour other than grey (here reddish-brown) is pretty nice too.<br><br>The cons, of course, are that the legs are just plain black and the face is not going to be very versatile, what with that ruddy great chinstrap print across it.<br><br>But beyond considering the components, this minifig is one that is greater than the sum of it's parts. I am personally very tempted to get multiples, so that i can have my own little bunch on parade!<br><br>If you are feeling up the bags for this minifig, yr best bet is to look out for the huge bearskin hat - it is unmistakable.

I'm not a bloke, but here are my 2 cents worth of views...<div><br><div>The busby is great and proportional (that's what I like about it, overall), the chin strap is superb, the color of the gun is spot on in a traditional LEGO kind of way, and the prints on the front torso are spic and span. There appears to be some improvement in the quality of the plastic, as with the later series. But you still know where it was made, of course.</div></div><div><br></div><div>However, I wish that they placed prints on the back as well...all it needed were some lines and a few buttons, I believe. And if you're really strict about it, you're not supposed to see most of his eyes. And also may a straight red line on each side of the legs will help, too.</div><div><br></div><div>Still, at the price I got it, it's still a dandy. At the very least, you need 2 of these to guard the gate. But you'll need a lot more if you want to build a Royal band...if only LEGO will come up with more instruments for a brass band.&nbsp;Or maybe you can build your own Royal wedding.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For me, this is one of the most playable minifigs and though it may not be as famous as the Spartan, nor the Gladiator that comes with it in the whole pack, I recommend you get one of these, even if it's not for army building.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"giraffefreckles","2011-09-13T23:50:57.957Z","Comparison of Two","<p>I now have two of these to compare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one had his hat so low over his face, part of the eyes were obscured.&nbsp; (This is how it looks in real life, but this certainly does not match what's pictured on the minifigure package.)&nbsp; In fact, the hat&nbsp; ate up enough of his face that he looked like he was wearing a big boy's hat.&nbsp; Since the eyebrows were completely covered up, he ended up with a ""Oh, no!&nbsp; Who's there?!?"" look instead of just ""Who's there!?!""&nbsp; I tried leaving the hat on looser to achieve the package look, but the hat would just pop off at the slightest of play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, LEGO was kind enough to give me a replacement guard.&nbsp; (They just happened to have one already opened on their desk -- versus a replacement mystery package.)&nbsp; This newer one is closer to the one pictured in the package, although not all of his eyebrows are yet showing.&nbsp; However, enough of the eyebrows can be seen that he now has a serious look versus&nbsp;the slightly concerned/surprised look on the earlier figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman whom I talked to at LEGO indicated she was a collector, and her guard looked exactly like the package picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also seen a picture online (I forget where) of one guard whose eyes were mostly covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, your mileage really will vary.&nbsp; The same holds true for the rifle.&nbsp; One popped into the guard's hands quite easily, and the other wanted to slip out.</p>

He's good for those looking to complete a collection and I certainly can't argue that the figure isn't well thought of. It does have a lot of excellent detailing from the gold chin strap print on the face, the torso printing and the brown rifle and large black hat. The figure is unmistakably what it is. And I've seen plenty of good MOCs like at Brickcon making excellent use of this figure. So while not a personal favorite, it is one that stays in my collection to round out Series 5 and complete it.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Royal Guard from Series 5 of LEGO's Collectible Minifigures is absolutely one of The Best Minifigures introduced during the entire Series, it, in my opinion, is right up there with the Elf, the Statue of Liberty and the Computer Programmer.</p>
<p>It is also a great Troop Builder, to coin a phrase from other collectibles, with an army of Royal Guards stationed around your MOC Buckingham Palace all you'll need is a Queen of England Minifigure to go with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the print and parts. The Royal Guard has a unique new hat piece, it is also one of the easiest parts to feel when searching through blind bags of Series 5, you'll easily find which ones are Royal Guards with the feel method here. He has a red one-sided print torso with a great looking representation of the actual Royal Guard's uniforms. Unfortunately he has only plain black pants, no printing here, not that it is needed. Lastly his facial print is perfect, he has a stoic looking face with a thin line straight faced mouth, and some eyebrows that are angled slightly, giving off the impression that he's very stern. Unfortunately without the hat his head will look rather odd as the print also includes the strap used to keep the hat on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, he has a unique brown colored rifle first introduced with the Western Theme. This is ironically enough the first time we've had this piece in a color that would reflect its real life counterpart. Overall I'd have to say that this Minifigure is a must own from Series 5, and I'd suggest picking up multiples.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4

<p>This is a very nice minifigure for its day, and is very stern-faced soldier. He has a new hat mold, and is a pleasure to look at. The print on the torso is very ornate, and is a wonderful sight. It would go well with Queen (71011), Classic King (71008), Tower Bridge (10214), and Big Ben (10253).</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-03T16:25:17.153Z","a GOOD figure!","<p>The third figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Royal Guard. This figure retailed for three dollars, was released in 2011, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that very awesome hat piece. I love how big it is, and I also love all the fluffy moulding on it. The flat top also looks good. I believe that piece was new for the figure as well, which is great.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a good print. I love the concentrated expression, and the strap looks cool, too. It isn&#39;t the most complex face, but that&#39;s okay because it doesn&#39;t need to be crazy-detailed. He has no alternate face printing.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has a pretty good simplistic design. I like the belt, with that gold buckle. But I think it might be a bit&nbsp;too simple for three dollars, especially since he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>And his legs are just plain black without printing, so let&#39;s move on to his accessory, which is a big rifle. It actually does look good, with the big barrel, as well as that big hilt or whatever you call it! I don&#39;t know any technical terms for guns, so I&#39;m just gonna say it&#39;s a great piece, and leave it at that!</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, I love almost every Series 5 figure, and I love this one as well. I don&#39;t like it as much as some others in the series, but it&#39;s still a fantastic figure, in my personal opinion. The hat is my favourite part, and the whole outfit he has looks simplistic, which would normally be bad. However, real Royal Guards wear simple outfits, so LEGO&nbsp;did their best with what they had, and I think they did a great job. However, this still isn&#39;t my all-time favourite of the series, even though it is one of them, and the price of three dollars is pretty bad, just like all the other Series 5 figures. So in the end, this gets a 4 out of 5 for me.</p>
