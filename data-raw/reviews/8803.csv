The printing is only on the front but is very neat. Definitely looks warm. The new hood is a nice addition. I can imagine an arctic party with lots of these figures. I will be getting a couple more copies of this one. <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

Nice printing on the torso as well, and as a bonus, the Fisherman comes with a fishing rod, a line, and a fish.&nbsp;The only thing that's missing is a BBQ!&nbsp;The minifigure can hold on to&nbsp;the Fish, and you can hook the fish on to the line. The minifigure comes with a stand as well, and looks quite cute when you stand it there with the Rod line and fish.<br><br></p><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>A&nbsp;great&nbsp;addition to your collection.&nbsp;It really is good, so are the other minifigures, so if you don't get it, ah well, but if you do, awesome. 5/5<br><br>LEGOSLUG<br><br>P.S.

"Snowtrooper119","2011-11-17T05:16:51.68Z","Catch of the series","I was very lucky to get hold of this minifigure. He is just fantastic. This minifigure has some wonderful accesories such as the&nbsp;green fish and the briliant&nbsp;tan hood. He has a face that has been seen many times before but it looks really&nbsp;suitable inside the hood. The detailing is superb and I really like the torso and leg printing that shows stiches and fur, implying that it is homemade and&nbsp;that an animal was harmed in the making of it. The fishing pole with the green fish on the end is a nice touch too. I really like this minifigure (especially the hood)&nbsp;and I think that if you get you will not be dissapointed.",FALSE,5,5,3,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-03T21:20:19.313Z","a cool figure!","<p>The fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Ice Fisherman. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that excellent hood piece. I love how that looks, with the very complex fur moulding all around it, and there&#39;s even some wrinkle moulding on the sides. I also really like how that light brown colour is printed all around it. And what&#39;s even cooler, is that I think that might&#39;ve been new for the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a great print. I like the chipper smile, and I like the cheekbone printing on the sides of the mouth. I also really like how generic and plain it is, because it can be used in many situations with many figures. No alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is his torso print, which looks pretty good. I like the bits of fur printing, and something I really like about him, is that he has those strings to tighten the hood hanging down on the torso. That&#39;s just a really nice extra bit of printing that is greatly appreciated. However, he has no back torso printing, which is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some more detailed printing. I really like the fur all over it, and I also like how that peach colour is printed. I do kind of think he needs side leg printing to elaborate on the bits of fur some more, but it&#39;s not a huge deal.</p>

<p>And his accessories are pretty great! He has a fishing pole, and that consists of three pieces: the pole, the string, and the fish. The pole, while it isn&#39;t new to the figure, has a nice reddish-brown colouring, and I love how long it is. I also like the studs on the bottom, as well as the clip on top. He also has that black string, which has a stud on one side and a pole on the other. I love how the string wraps around the pole and clips to the clip on top. Lastly, he has that sand green fish, which connects to that pole. I like the colour its caste in, and I love how LEGO included it.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, this is a very solid and great figure. As I&#39;ve said in all my previous Series 5 reviews, I love almost every figure in this series, and this one is no exception. Though he isn&#39;t my favourite, he&#39;s definitely one of them. I just like the concept, and I think it was executed well, with the prints, moulds, and pieces.</p>

<p>And thanks for reading!</p>
