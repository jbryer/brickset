The cavewoman comes with a small club,Rubber hair wich can be altered if the packet has had pressure or if someone pressed to hard,and a bone to put in he hair.Her torso has a small necklace and some animal skin clothing(even printed on the back),Her face has a confused expression and a sore on it</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Back printing 
<li>Red hair and lots of items(club and bone) 
<li>easy to determin</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Huh? 
<li></li></ul>

<p>If you have the caveman from series 1 this makes a great cavemate and a great addition for a prehistoric setting, find her if you can.&nbsp; -thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5

Cave Man and Woman!","Now that were in the fifth series of LEGO minifigures, we start to see many of the themes grow companions between male and female characters. The advantage of this of course is that it extends the lifespan of this product range, and ensures that LEGO fans are hungry for every new series!<div><br></div><div>The Cave Woman featured needs no introduction, for her Cave Man (Husband or partner? You decide!) arrived in Series 1... Yep, remember that Series? Together, the two look absolutely wonderful and I would suggest that their value is greatly increased - both in playability and economically. Out of the two though, it is this Cave Woman that has taken my No.1 spot.</div><div><br></div><div>Lets face it, her facial expression is just absolutely delightful and so typical of LEGO to introduce both humour and canny realism to a small plastic head. It is a face of awkwardness - our little friend is obviously naive about the world. And wouldn't you be if you grew up in a cave?</div><div><br></div><div>The product features the same 'mallet' hand piece that is brown and spiky, but it is the hair piece that shines for it is almost rubber-like and features some excellent details; both elegant and authentic at the same time. The 'bone' piece that clips onto the hair is the icing on the cake, though I highly down this poor Cave Woman will be eating cake any time soon!</div><div><br></div><div>This minifigure makes an excellent pairing with the Cave Man and certainly should not be missed.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"AETerry","2011-09-21T12:35:39.453Z","Cave Woman Review","The Cave Woman is an obvious female counterpart to the Caveman of Series 1. And at $2.99 she is indeed well worth adding to a collection. The print job for her outfit and the grime print on her face are outstanding. Then there's her rubbery hair piece that holds a bone for her primitive fashion statement. Added to this is her large club for defending herself.<br><br>With this figure, there is a huge amount of playability and MOC ideas that I can see done and not just her collectivity factor. She's well worth it for collection.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
"clundsberg","2011-08-30T16:21:54.36Z","I kissed a cavegirl and I liked it.","<p>I fell in love with this mini.&nbsp; (and no, I didn't kiss her - geez!) I love her rubbery original hairdo, I love that there is a removable bone that she can either hold or use as a hairpiece, I love how insanely huge her club is and I love how detailed the decals are on this one with the tattered animal print clothes (on front and back).</p>
<p>The lack of cave people in the LEGO world does not bother me.&nbsp; I know that dinosaurs didn't exist at the same time, but for the sake of the Flintstones, you can use these minis with the old Adventurers Dinos as one option, likewise as a museum mannequin and of course just as a mini going to&nbsp;a costume party.</p>
<p>The best feature about this mini and the main reason she was such a surprise to me was her face.&nbsp; The little scuff on her cheek shows how dirty her conditions are or perhaps how hard at work she has been with that massive club of hers.&nbsp;(perhaps while her caveman of a mate is slacking off) I also enjoy that she has apparently invented lipstick and is wearing it...now that I think about it, maybe that ""scuff"" I mentioned was just her attempt at blush.&nbsp; Her facial expression is what truly captured my attention though.&nbsp; This no-nonesense gal has a raised eyebrow and pouty lips as if to say ""You said WHAT to me, now?"" (that poor, poor neanderthal of a mate she has, ugh!) and her long, lowered eyelashes give this cavewoman a sense of intelligence almost inferring the real genius behind every great caveman.</p>
<p>Definitely one of my favourites from this series, I think you will be pleassantly surprised with this find.</p>
<p>Now I guess I better go ebay the caveman.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T20:51:24.867Z","WILMA! I'm Home.","<p>Set #8805 Cave Woman: I never got the Cave Man from Series 1, but when I opened my third bag from Series 5 I was amazed and thrilled to get the Cave Woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure may not be well liked by everybody, it can be difficult to fit in with your LEGO display, but I think she's a bit underappreciated for what she is. This Mini-Figure looks like it would be great for a 10 000 BC MOC or Flinstones MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cave Woman has a double-side torso printed with a tanned hide outfit from an animal she or her husband has skinned. Her leg printing matches quite nicely, and the color of the outfit is printed on both sides of her legs as well. There are a lot of stiches on the print making it look like something made from strips of fabrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her hairpiece is a nice dull auburn color with a ponytail and a bone piece to add to make it look like she's wearing it through her hair. She carries a massive club and her facial print is dirty and smudged as if she's been busy in the wild. (Or possibly beaten up a little while protecting herself from wild dinosaurs or something.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this Mini-Figure is definitely underrated for what it is, and you should really take a second look at it before dismissing it as something not to own.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"LEGOSWHP102","2012-01-02T14:16:33.293Z","A Cave Woman is just not worth it","<p>The Minifigure Series contains all sorts of cool minifigures that you'll enjoy, but the problem is that not all minifigures are like that.</p>
<h4>Parts or Minifigure</h4>
<p>It comes with just a minifigure, so it's just a leg piece, body and arm piece, head piece, hair piece, and some accessory. The Minifigure Series also comes with a&nbsp;small black baseplate for the minifigure to stand.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This minifigure is not that good. The only thing I like about this is the hair piece with the bone on it and the weapon. Everything else is sadly a disappointment. I know a lot of people enjoy this minifigure, but I am sorry to say that this is one of the very few Minifigure disappointments in the minifig&nbsp;series (my opinion).</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,2,3

The torso and the legs look very nice and I also like the markings on her face. The hair piece has a new mould and on the top is a bone which looks very nice on this minifig. We also get a club with this figure just like the caveman did in series 1.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"vikings","2020-06-02T03:18:46.68Z","Cave Woman","<p><b>Box/Instruction:</b></p>

<p>Comes in the normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a small white bone, a dark brown club with spikes, and a black CMS stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Cave Woman:</b></p>

<p>The cave woman is a nice CMS figure to get. She has an orange hair piece and has an area for the bone to go. She has a single sided head. She has a neutral expression with a mark on the left side of her cheek resembling a hashtag symbol. The printing on her torso is really good and there is a necklace&nbsp;with a black arrowhead attached to it. She has cloth clothing on her torso and legs with stiches. She is armed with her dark brown club with four spikes which is an amazing piece to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a middle of pack figure from CMS wave 5. The cavewoman is still a great CMS figure to get. The hair piece and the club are great parts to get and add some nice detail to the figure as a whole. I highly recommend getting this CMS figure to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-03T21:26:17.493Z","A good figure, BUT...","<p>The Cave Woman is the fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5. She was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair piece, with the bone clipped in it. That hair was new for the figure, and it&#39;s caste in an awesome orange colour. I think that hair looks great, and I think it fits the figure excellently. It is cool how the bone clips in, but when the bone is removed, it just looks weird. Still, I like that mould.</p>

<p>Next up, we have her face, which looks superb. I really like the neutral expression, and I also like the little scrape on her cheek. I also like how it isn&#39;t too over-the-top, because now, it can basically be used in any setting. No alternate expression. One thing I must say though, is that the face is in another set. There&#39;s more on that later.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and arms. I do really like how her front printing looks, with that crystal necklace and the peach-coloured pelts. And her back printing looks just as good as her front, where it has some nice peach-coloured printing. It would&#39;ve been great to get arm printing, but oh well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have some really cool printing. I really like the stitching, as well as the printing on the sides, which have a dual-moulded design, though they ere just printed and are not dual-moulded. I like how perfectly they match up to the front of the legs as well.</p>

<p>And lastly, her accessory is that big, dark brown club. I love the spikes jutting out all around it, and I also like the big, bulky design of it. I think it was new for the figure in that colouring as well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! I actually have a lot to say about her though, so stay put. First off, this is a gender swap of the Series 1 Caveman, and if you read my review on that figure, you know that him, as well as this figure, were both included in a two pack, each with upgraded colours, parts, and printing, making these figures outdone. I mean this and the Caveman are still good for their time, but they&#39;re totally outdone by that two pack. However, that isn&#39;t a problem with these two figures, but it sucks on LEGO&#39;s part that they even made that two pack because it makes these figures extremely inferior. And, as mentioned earlier, this figures face is either the same in the two pack, or an extremely close print. But again, that isn&#39;t a problem with this figure or the Caveman, therefore I will be judging this from a 2011 perspective, like all the other figures. And as a whole, this is a good figure, though it seems like many people despise her. No, she isn&#39;t at all my favourite in the series, but I love almost every Series 5 figure, and this is no exception. But once again, like all Series 5 figures, this is very overpriced at three dollars. But still, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 4. So read my other CMF reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
