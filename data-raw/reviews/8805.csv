"xccj","2011-08-31T02:28:06.1Z","Oh No, It's Godzilla!","<p>The Lizard man is&nbsp;another fig-in-a-costume, but he still looks great.&nbsp; Indeed, the costume theme is much more satisfying that the skateboarder / snowboarder / surfer copies, and I hope more are done in the future.&nbsp; The lizard&nbsp;himself is very detailed&nbsp;and can easily be a Lego version of Godzilla.&nbsp; (Actually, he also bears a close resemblance to Reptar from that old Nickelodeon cartoon Rugrats.&nbsp; Crazy.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lizard man doesn't come with any accessories, which is a shame.&nbsp; But his helmet and tail more than make up for it.&nbsp; The lizard helmet easily fits over a standard minifig head, with enough room in the mouth for the actor to see out of.&nbsp; The tail fits on like a cape, and helps give this costume monster some depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Detail</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lizard man&nbsp;comes in the bright-green color; it's a lighter shade than traditional green, so it makes him stand out a bit more.&nbsp; He has some lizard chest printing on his torso, and the minifig head show a slightly-pained expression of a actor who's been inside this costume all day.&nbsp; But the real detail is in the head and tail.&nbsp; The head is an excelent mold, with painted teeth and eyes and a detailed snout.&nbsp; (One slight issue about the teeth; the outside is painted white, but the bottom and top portions are still green.)&nbsp; He also has these dark green spikes that run down the back of his helmet and onto his tail.&nbsp; The transition between the two pieces is very seamless; it's a great design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finding Him</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went to feel through the bags, I was worried that the Lizard Man will be hard to find.&nbsp; After all, he doesn't have any small unique pieces that you can isolate in the bag, and his helmet could surely be confused with the various hairpieces.&nbsp; But the tail is very distinct in the bag; it's large and has a unique shape and feel to it.&nbsp; If you want to feel through the bags, that's the piece you should be looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought this fig looked great in the initial product pictures, and he is also great in person.&nbsp; He'd be a great figure to have in your collection.&nbsp; And I don't know about anybody else, but my lizard man is going to join up with the Gorilla Suit Man and reenact scenes from Godzilla vs King Kong.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>Cool head and tail pieces </p>
<p>Nice vibrant green colour</p>

<p>Parts</p>
<p>The dino guy is made of all new pieces! His helmet is awesome! It has eyes printed on it. Also teeth.He has the spikes on the back of him that go down his tail. He has printed abbs on his torso which is awesome!Then he has regular green legs.</p>
<p>How To Get</p>
<p>To feel in the packs can be difficult. You should feel for the helmet with spikes, and the tail. I would recemend going to your local Lego store for them. The employes will help you feel for them. Sometimes they just pick them right out of there pockets! You can find a lego store near you on Lego.com! DINO RULES! I have 3 of them because there so awesome!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-22T13:04:32.85Z","Lizard Man Review","The Lizard Man is hands down one of the best and better Minifigures of Series 5. He continues the trend of costumed characters seen with the Gorilla Suit Guy of Series 3. While he doesn't really have a unique accessory that he holds or carries, the tail part of his costume makes up for that fact.<br><br>The detailing of this minifigure is just outstanding with the level of quality and detail work put into it. I can see all sorts of MOC possibilities and ideas that can be done with this figure. He comes out to be just a fun and exciting figure for the collection, $2.99 is worth it for him. I can always hope for cheaper, but I don't want to be paying more for these guys. It would cease to be worth it.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,5
"The_Reviewer","2011-12-13T12:54:48.59Z","Godzilla?","<p>&nbsp;First of all this is NOT anything like Godzilla, I have seen many Godzilla films and he was never green, (Except in Godzilla 2000, but he was dark green) Godzilla&nbsp; has usually been charcoal black with blue spikes, So this is actually looks more like Reptar from that lame&nbsp;rugrats cartoon that used to be on Nickelodeon. Now on to the rewiew. He has a tail piece that you put on his neck like what you would do with a cape, a lizard headgear where you can see his face. The head does not have a sweat face like the gorrila suit guy from series 3, but has a guy Grinning(probably cause he got the suit where you can see)The torso has&nbsp;yellow scales printed&nbsp;on his chest.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gives some wierd people to your lego city (Tired of keep getting Policemen?) 
<li>rare parts 
<li>Good for MOC</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does not look like Godzilla

<p>This definetly one of the best minifigures from series 5. Find it if you can. Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-09T15:04:42.68Z","""State your first name, last name, and occupation.""","<p>I imagine that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke"">David Icke</a> almost soiled himself in delight upon the revelation of Lizard Man being a Collectible Minifig; for the sane people among us, David Icke is a British conspiracy theorist who believes that lizard people not only live among us, but have infiltrated the highest levels of world government. These lizard people drink blood and are able to shapeshift into human form, thus being insidious and undetectable -&nbsp;except by David Icke, of course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I don't know what the stated intent of our LEGO Lizard Man is, but, if his face is anything to go by, he's certainly enjoying what he's doing. As far as Collectible Minifigs go, Lizard Man is fairly uncomplicated - the head of the lizard is piece of Minifig headgear, and the tail is a body accessory that tapers down from the neck and along the back. The primary colour scheme here is the cute ""recycling green"" that I only really know from Garbage Truck (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=4432-1"">4432</a>), which accented by the regular green on his spines that run neatly along the headgear and the body accessory. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several of the reviewers here have postulated that Lizard Man's purpose is to be sort of a <em>kaiju </em>type actor in a fake rubber suit, a hypothesis that is ostensibly supported by Gorilla Suit Guy (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8803-16"">8803</a>), the union of which will allow you to recreate your favourite scenes from <em>King Kong vs. Godzilla</em>. But I think that this hypothesis is flawed: if these Minifigs in suits are meant to be giant&nbsp;rubbery monsters, then there must be scale models appropriate to their size that can be stepped on. Given, then, the size of the smallest LEGO blocks in comparison to a Minifig, I find that no effective scale model could possibly be produced, thereby invalidating any sort of quasi-realism that one could hope to obtain from filming Lizard Man stomping around a miniature miniature LEGO city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, I can only assume that Lizard Man is himself a disciple of David Icke, and that he is waiting for the inevitable takeover of the lizard people alien race and is ready to join with them when they do. He rants and raves on the corner of my LEGO street to harangued passers-by, and none of them listen to his rants about the imminent repitiloid armageddon. Will you? </p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,1

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are wonderful.&nbsp; They look a lot like a Kaiju suit, such as <a href=""http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Godzilla"">http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Godzilla</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""http://ultra.wikia.com/wiki/Gomess"">http://ultra.wikia.com/wiki/Gomess</a>.&nbsp; The mask and tail are new parts, and the body is printed with a lizard stomach with scales.</p>

<p>When completed, the Lizard Man looks almost exactly like Godzilla.&nbsp; It&#39;s awesome!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this guy to Toku/monster movie/sci-fi fans.&nbsp; Replace the head with a black one or&nbsp;a trans-blue one (for Godzilla&#39;s atomic ray), and put him in a microscale city!</p>

<p>This is a very nice fig, with some decent printing. The torso is appropriate, as is the head. To me, though, the real deal with this minifigure&nbsp;is the new molds used for the tail and mask. They are very interesting, and pretty useful, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p>I think that this is well worth picking up, whether from eBay or bricklink. It is well worth the price, which isn&#39;t much to begin with. All in all, a very nice figure, and if you have the opportunity, pick it up. However, that is just my opinion; have whatever feelings you want about the set, and I will see you guys later!

"sideswinger","2021-04-06T15:29:12.72Z","my FAVOURITE in the Series!","<p>The sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Lizard Man. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that green lizard mask, which was new to the figure. I love all the really intricate printing on it, with the white teeth, the yellow eyes, and even the dark green spikes on the back. I also really do love how perfect the spikes back there line up with the tail piece. Overall, that&#39;s just such a great piece.</p>

<p>Next is his face print. You might think he has like a roaring expression under that mask, but he actually has a very chipper expression. However, I must say, it looks a little strange. I think the teeth are too straight or something. And I actually wish he did have a roaring face instead of a happy one, because that would fit the character a lot more. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>And I guess the next piece on this figure is that tail, which surprisingly enough, attaches at the neck. Again, I love how the dark green spikes line up perfectly with the mask, and I just love the curve at the tip, and it just looks awesome.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has a good print. I like the scales on the front, and I love how they all overlap one another. He has no back torso printing, which is good because it wouldn&#39;t look right with that big tail piece covering it.</p>

<p>And his legs are just plain green with no printing, which looks pretty good on the figure. But that&#39;s it for the figure! My overall opinion is that I love this guy! It&#39;s just such an original idea, and it&#39;s executed pretty masterfully. I love this figure so much, that he just might be my favourite CMF costumed figure ever. I can say with confidence, though, that he&#39;s my favourite in this series. So check out my other CMF reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
