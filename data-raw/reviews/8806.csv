"AlHazred","2011-08-29T10:37:22.677Z","Monkey Handler","<p>One of the cuter CMFs of the series, the zookeeper is a relatively simple figure. She has legs that bear a ""shorts"" pattern, a khaki ""Zoo"" shirt with female curves, head with beauty mark/dimple, and brown female hairstyle. I can't say I'm ecstatic that the torso has a ""Zoo"" nametag, as I like to reuse my torsos for customized figures, and that limits reusability considerably. She comes with two accessories: a banana, and a small monkey -- the monkey is different from the older-style LEGO monkey in that it is not articulated, being a single-piece accessory. <br></p><p>It seems to me that TLG could have reused the molds for the original 2550c01 ""Brown Monkey"" piece; it might have been a little more expensive, but you could just drop the banana, and it would add more playability to the CMF. As it is, I think you lose some playability that could have been.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Female minifigure; females have historically been underrepresented in LEGO products so it's nice to get some variety.</li><li>Monkey accessory (with a caveat)<br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Monkey accessory could have been articulated</li><li>I would have preferred the torso to not have the ""Zoo"" nametag, to increase reusability of the torso<br></li></ul>
<p>This CMF is probably only of real interest to the collectors, or perhaps City enthusiasts looking to increase variety in their LEGO zoos.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,4
"xccj","2011-08-31T02:50:58.703Z","Going to the Zoo","<p>I have liked many of the female figs that have come in the Collectible Minifigure series, but the zookeeper is one that is not over the top and still looks great.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Piece Highlights</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Torso (I like the modest feminen curves)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Khaki Pants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hair piece (one of my favorites to come out of the collectible minifigs, and this time it's in reddish-brown)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice detailed face (the crooked smile isn't new, but I still prefer it over some older female faces)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Banana (always a useful food piece)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Monkey (a single mold that can sit on a single stud and has a graspable arm.&nbsp; It's nice and detailed, and while it can't do much, it does remind me of some of the old Duplo animals, which is cool)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How To Find Her</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I initially thought that it would be easiest to feel out the monkey in the bag, but it can easily be confused with other pieces.&nbsp; Instead, I would search for the banana, which is small enough to be isolated and has a distinct feel to it.&nbsp; Plus, it helps that she's one of the more common figs in this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's not the best of Series 5, nor does she have the most amazing pieces.&nbsp; But she has a nice overall look, and it's always good to have another female in your minifig collection, especially if you're looking to customize some figs of your own.&nbsp; Plus, the little monkey is too cute to pass up on.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-23T09:52:56.783Z","Zookeeper Review","This figure is cute enough, given the concept. And it's the concept for this figure that makes it along with the little monkey she comes with. I'm far more partial to the the minifigure monkeys first introduced with the Pirates theme then this one. Still it's good for MOCs, especially if there will ever be a way to get more of these in sets and create a Zoo.<br><br>Otherwise the figure is fairly standard with her facial print for a female figure, the banana piece that's fairly uncommon and the hair piece for her. The print job for her zoo outfit win out over the rest, showing her to be unique among other female figures of the Collectible Series.<br><br>At $2.99, the price is decent and worth it given the level of detail and quality that LEGO seems to continue holding to for the Minifigures. I think she's worth it for a collection.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T21:04:39.407Z","We Bought a Zookeeper","<p>Set #8805 Zookeeper: This has to be one of the only Female Mini-Figures I own that doesn't look feminine as far as torso prints are concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zookeeper is considered one of the best offered with Series 5 due to the pieces she has, I can't fault collectors and kids who like it, personally I think she's just OK. Although I must admit when LEGO make&nbsp;a Mini-Figure they sure know how to make some pretty darn unique prints with these Collectible ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's got pockets on her leg print, and she's wearing shorts, the print wraps around the sides of the legs. Her torso print is a Zookeeper uniform with belt and a key for the cages, as well as a little Zoo nametag, but as I said she doesn't look very feminine, there are no distinct or obvious&nbsp;curves to be seen. So if you wanted you could use her torso when MOCing a male Zookeeper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her hairpiece is the same we've seen on the Nurse and Tennis Player before her, only it's a different color, and of course she comes with a bananna and&nbsp;a little chimpanzee. With all the unique animals LEGO has been introducing I'm really hoping that one year they make an actual Zoo or Circus set with some lions, giraffes, tigers and hippos. Anyway, I would definitely reccomend the Zookeeper Mini-Figure for your collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"LEGOSLUG","2011-10-19T15:06:49.61Z","Monkey Escape at the Zoo!","Here is my review of the set 8805-7 Zookeeper.<br>To start off, I thank my brother for giving me this Minifigure, even though he had bought it for himself. <br><br><h4>The Minifigure:</h4>The female zookeeper is a great minifigure, because you can actually change the head to a male figure, if you have a spare head. Nice printing on the torso as well, and as a bonus, a Monkey is included as well. The minifigure can hold on the Monkey, and the Monkey can hold the banana included. The minifigure comes with a stand as well, and looks quite cute when you stand it there with the Monkey.<br><br><h4>Conclusion:</h4>A great minifigure. Worth trying to get it, my brother got it by feeling the bags, then felt the banana! It really is good, so are the other minifigures, so if you don't&nbsp;get it,&nbsp;ah well, but if you do, awesome. 5/5<br><br>LEGOSLUG<br><br>P.S. Please take a look at my other reveiws, and my bricklists.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"Red_Five2","2016-12-19T20:08:00.537Z","The zookeeper!","<p>Set 8805 (the zookeeper) is made up of seven pieces. The first accessory is a yellow banana. The second accessory is a little monkey. The hair is in brown. The face has got a big smirk. The torso shows a brown belt with some gold keys. The belt dosn&#39;t go around the torso. The legs have printing on the sides. Also it has pocket&#39;s.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-06T15:48:53.32Z","a COOL figure!","<p>The seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Zookeeper. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that pony-tail hairpiece. That piece isn&#39;t anything amazing, but for some reason it fits the figure extremely well, and I don&#39;t really know why, to be honest. Another cool thing about it is that it actually wasn&#39;t that common in 2011, although it was the most common in this colour, if I&#39;m not mistaking. But overall, I really love how that piece looks on the figure.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a great print. I love that little smirk, and even that tiny mole looks great. That face also works for the figure as well, if you ask me, and it looks pretty cute overall. She has no alternate expression, but that frontal face looks really fitting if you ask me.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which does have some really awesome printing. I love the peach colour, as well as her big, brown belt. It&#39;s just a really awesome print. She has no back printing, which is a little sad, but oh well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have pretty cool printing. I really like the yellow skin on the front, as well as the pockets. She has some really great side leg printing as well, with more yellow flesh colouring.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure itself, so let&#39;s talk about her two accessories. The first is that banana, which isn&#39;t new to the figure, but it is an extremely fitting accessory, and I love that piece overall. But the most interesting piece in this figure is that monkey. It was new for the figure, and it looks fantastic. I love the moulding on the face, as well as his arms and legs, and I love how it can be held by minifigures at the arm. It&nbsp;has some really nice printing on his face, and it looks great overall.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! As I&#39;ve said in my previous reviews, I love almost every figure in Series 5, and this is no exception. I love how original the idea is, and her parts and prints are awesome, especially that monkey. I think this is one of the most original figures in the series, and I love how she came out. But as I said with the other CMF figures, she isn&#39;t worth three dollars. But that&#39;s it for the figure, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>A very nice set and easy to build, not much to talk about in the building experience</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The best&nbsp; &quot;part&quot;&nbsp; of this set! I love the monkey piece and the banana. The monkey is very good and I love the way the minifigure holds it. The monkey is just so cute. The banana is great for the monkey and a fun accessory. The zookeeper is a bad&nbsp;minifigure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for&nbsp;Money</p>

<p>The cost is great! It is so cheap! I love how many awesome pieces you get for the set! I don&#39;t like the zookeeper and I built a cage for the monkey with trees and all. The banana is fun for comedy. I hope you like my review and please check my other review!</p>
