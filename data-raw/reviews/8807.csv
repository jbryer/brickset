The pants are a slightly different hue to that of the promotional photograph - more washed out/grey than you would originally expect.<div><br></div><div>That baseball cap, by the way, is not the same mould that wee normally see. It appears to be a brand new design just for this minifigure, and features a more realistic design with seam indents and material panels. In short, it looks excellent!<br><div><br></div><div>This chaps face has a confident smile and also sports a fair amount of stubble; i'm guessing, being a mans-man, that he doesn't need to shave every day!</div><div><br></div><div>What I like about this minifigure is that it has a lot of unexpected playability. It would require some other collecting however - his best environment obviously being a forest, but then rarely do fans build one, so the quickest fix is that, behind is country home, he has a collection of small trees and logs that he's chopping up for fire wood. LEGO have indeed released some nice 'Creator' homes, and I think this minifigure would be an excellent addition to them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

<p>a-hem...anyways, when you think epitome of Lumberjack, this guy comes to mind.&nbsp; From his highly detailed flanel print, to his scruffy ""I play hockey on the side, eh?"" beard this LEGO pretty much reeks of maple syrup and beer (don't knock it till you've tried it...actually scratch that - it sounds like a horrible idea).</p>
<p>The details on this mini are simply amazing and in abundance.&nbsp; The axe is a nice solid lego piece, very long in the handle and multi-coloured with brown, red and silver.&nbsp; (you might feel for this when groping the packages at your local store)&nbsp;&nbsp; The afore-mentioned plaid flanel look covers both the front, back *and* arms of this mini!&nbsp; His hat, by far, is my favourite accessory.&nbsp; It's the newer LEGO hat design, so you can see ""stitching"" details.&nbsp; It also&nbsp;sports a white and red design with (get this) a beaver logo.&nbsp; It makes me want a LEGO beaver so he has someone to pal around with.</p>
<p>To me,&nbsp;unlike the Egyptian Queen Mini who has a bunch of sets (albiet with mummy servants) to carouse around, the lumberjack is a little more difficult.&nbsp; Some of my thoughts are with farm sets, Christmas sets (or any sets that have an abundance of trees) and possibly any utilitarian/construction sets.&nbsp; Personally I think he goes very well with the City Advent calendar a couple years back that came with a chainsaw and logs.</p>
<p>Would definitely be interesting to see a more forresty line of LEGO, in the meantime, this is one cool figure to get.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-28T16:06:25.05Z","Lumberjack Review","This figure is easily my favorite from Series 5 for the Collectible Minifigures. And a lot of that is owed to flannel style shirt of the lumberjack and another figure featuring the new style of ballcaps found on these CMs. The woodcutter's style axe is also great and far different from any axes featured in previous LEGO sets.<br><br>For concept, the print and detail work all comes together in an awesome looking figure. He's truly another success for LEGO and while I can always hope for a lower price, $2.99 continues to be an alright price to pay, especially if LEGO will maintain this level of quality.<br><br>I typically don't score higher for Building or Parts due to this being a Collectible Minifigure and not a full set. Still, he's very fun and worthy addition to a collection. I can see lots of uses for him in MOCs and play.<br>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T11:25:08.407Z","TIMBER!","<p>Set 8805 Lumberjack: Part of Series 5 of the Collectible Minifigures the Luberjack makes a great addition to your Minifigure collection, and can stand in with the newer Forest Themed LEGO City sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Minifigure includes the Baseball Cap hat piece, this time it is cast in a dark red tone with a white front, and a beaver symbol standing out boldly in that field of white on his cap. Either he's from Canada or just likes beavers, it is an awesome deco pattern for the hat. Another true to life style that you can find in most rural areas of North America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His facial print is a big smiling bearded print, he's been out in the woods for a while and could use a shave, he also has bushy eyebrows. Not seen too often in LEGO Minifigures. Carrying a great new axe piece, and with a double-sided torso print completeing the Lumberjack look, the print is actually pretty impressive as far as torso prints go. I'm not sure if it's a flannel button up shirt, or jacket, but he looks great. He does include arm prints, which makes him look just a tiny bit odd from the side, because the side of his torso is plain red without any printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly he includes a lighter toned blue pair of legs than we've seen before, or at least it is a rare color used for Minifigure legs. Overall I'd have to say this is one of the better offerings from Series 5 and definitely one worth tracking down if you haven't gotten one already.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

	I recently got this set from Lego Shop@Home, and like this fig relatively well. However, this isn&#39;t my absolute favorite minifig from the line.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The hatchet is a nice and memorable piece.</li>
	<li>
		The plaid shirt is truly just epic.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		I&#39;m confused as to what his true allegiance is; it looks like he has celery in his pocket (The 5th Doctor), a chipmunk on his awesome hat, and the hatchet.</li>
	<li>
		A little backprinting on the head would make this one step ahead.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is among the greats in my minifig collection, but also one of the simpler, everyday ones. I highly recommend this figure.</p>

"Trojan29","2012-03-19T11:19:28.38Z","LEGO Minifigures 8805-8 Lumberjack Review.","<p>I got this set a little time ago, and i was thinking ""there will probably be the evil dwarf"" , but when i opened up the package there was another lumberjack.In fact, i already have one so this is gonna be his brother in my collection.</p>
<p>First what i like about this set is the rare hatchet, and of course the cap.</p>
<p>Second is that this set is what you can play with very well, and so one of the sets that i like to have a copy of 'couse having two lumberjacks is better than one (at least i think so).</p>
<p>The reason why i made this review when i have gotten a copy of this set is that when i first got it i wanted to make a review but something (i don't really remember what) stopped me from doing this.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-06T21:18:10.637Z","a DETAILED figure!","<p>The eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Lumberjack. This figure was released in 2011, he retailed for three dollars, and it included 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that excellent hat piece. That piece was introduced in Series 3, and this is an exclusive print. I love that black skunk on the white background, and the dark, dee, red colour it&#39;s caste in is great as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has an awesome print. I love how big his smile is, and that stubble surrounding his face looks really great. I just really like that, and I think it&#39;s one of my favourite faces in the series. He has no alternate face printing, which is good since it&#39;d be severely exposed by that hat.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms, which have incredible detail. I really love the rugged, plaid design, as well as the button up design. And that printing on those arms is just incredible, with more plaid printing. And he has some amazing back printing as well. Overall, I think this is the most detailed torso and arm printing in the entire series.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have no printing. I love the sand blue colour they&#39;re caste in, though. Still, let&#39;s move on to the accessory, which is that axe piece. I love that piece, and I think it might&#39;ve been new for the figure. It&#39;s caste in a reddish-brown colour, and it has some red and silver printing at the top there. I love that, and I also love how it comes to a perfect tip at the edge.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, the printing on this figure is the best printing in the whole series, and I think this is also the most detailed figure in the whole series. With that being said, it isn&#39;t my favourite in the series, but it is totally one of my favourites, maybe top 3, or even top 2. So that&#39;s a wrap! Check out my other CMF reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
