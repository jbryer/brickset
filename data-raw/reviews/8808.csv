This figure really is a gem, and no less for the fact that, once again, its the small details that make a huge difference. The use of colour is striking and clearly superior to the original 'normal' sized Clown from Series 1 - this little chap has primary colours with red, green and blue, all of which dominate his hat, top and pants. The white gloves, face and pie break up the dress and really bring out the features that are significant to the circus - those being his comical facial features and the pie.</div><div><br></div><div>Another reason this chap is superior to the original Series 1 clown is that his additional hand-item is actually good quality, and particularly rare. The horn on the other hand (excuse the pun) that the Series 1 Clown had wasn't good quality.</div><div><br></div><div>Series 5 is shaping up to be the most consistently-brilliant yet, and i'll certainly be adding more Clowns to my already bulging circus!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"clundsberg","2011-08-30T15:47:13.293Z","Who Wants PIE!?!","<p>First off, before even opening these guys, my son was infatuated with the possibility of obtaining a LEGO pie.&nbsp; Lucky him we pulled this guy.</p>
<p>Now, I must admit while this mini is growing on me (mostly because of my son) I tend to be a little biased on these mini-mini-legos.&nbsp; For some reason the concept of legs that cannot bend kind of frustrates me - it seems like they could have made this happen by now.&nbsp; Why this doesn't bother me with female LEGO minis that have dresses, I'll never know, but yeah, irritating.&nbsp; Secondly, clowns never seem to be the most popular character in the world to me and no, I'm not afraid of them.</p>
<p>My little rant aside, allow me to contradict myself.&nbsp; A LEGO circus would be amazing especially if you were fortunate to own the Merry Go Round or some other clown minis plus LEGO animals seems to be becomming a bit more abundant.&nbsp; These clowns&nbsp;can also be a part of the Joker's gang if you want to take that path, so it's not like they do not have their place in a LEGO community aside from street performers.</p>
<p>As a parent, I am overjoyed with the enthusiastic reaction from my 6.5 year old when he opened this character.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;pie-clown&nbsp;is brightly coloured, well detailed with polkadot tie, blue and yellow lapels and a flower (which no doubt squirts water) print on his blue bowler (a unique hat to boot!).&nbsp; His expression is that of surprise and laughter and his little red nose is definitely honkable.&nbsp; The pie is what really makes this character great, however, it being a very rare LEGO accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can see days of mischief ambushing other minis with his pie throwing ways (wish he came with 2 though)&nbsp;perhaps with Gorilla Guy in tow. OOH! Time to bust out the mini car too!</p>
<p>For those of you wondering how to best find this mini, the pie is the most obvious feature to feel for, however my first observation was how flat and light this package was n comparison to the others I received from LEGO.com.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"legospongepotter","2011-11-22T16:24:14.157Z","Circus Theme, Anyone?","Imagine the pleasant surprise I&nbsp;received&nbsp;when I opened the Collectible Minifigure Series 5 bag and found this inside. The Small Clown is one of the better Series 5 Minifigures, though all of them are really good. There are lots of cool things about this clown. I think he's a lot better than the clown from Series 1. All the printing is brighter and to me, the other Clown was a bit creepy. You know, Lego could turn this into a theme. Can you imagine a Circus Theme? That would be cool.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>Hat: </b>The hat is a new mold I believe, an old fashioned sort-of top hat but rounded. The edges look floppy so it looks really cool on the clown. The hat is bright blue and has a red flower in the middle, which I'm sure will squirt water on an&nbsp;unsuspecting&nbsp;victim.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Head: </b>Like the Clown from Series 1, the head is covered in make-up, but this time, his whole head is white. The clown is laughing with a lipstick-covered mouth and a big red squishy nose. His eyes have some blue paint in the corner and his eyebrows are raised in an arch. I'm not going to lie, it's still kind of creepy, but it's not as much.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Torso: </b>The clown has a red coat with blue pockets. The inside of the coat is orange. The shirt underneath is blue and he's wearing an orange tie with blue spots. The whole torso is full of bright colors. I just goes to show the detail Lego is adding to their minifigures. The clown's hands are white, to show that they're also covered in make-up, or maybe gloves.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Legs: </b>The legs are short, so he can't really walk. They're also bright green, fairly unusual for short legs but definitely a nice touch. The legs actually add a lot of bright color to the whole minifigure, so its really a great piece to have.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pie: </b>Ah, the most appealing part of the set. The pie is a brand new piece and is meant to be one of those pies clowns throw into each other's faces for laughs. The outside, the crust, has little ridges and is tan, making it fairly realistic. The inside is a big one swirl, so its apparently a cream pie. It looks delicious, if I must say. Also, for any MOCers out their or brickfilmers, anything involving a warm kitchen and dinner would look great with an appealing desert. Just saying.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall: </b>Like I said, this is a really great minifigure. The colors and new pie-piece make it especially appealing so it's worth getting. You better wish you get it next time you're feeling Collectible Minifigures at Wal-Mart, or whatever. This is a minifigure that is great to have in someone's collection. By the way, if anyone out there is somehow involved in the LEGO company...please suggest my circus theme idea XD</div><div><br></div><div>Building Experience: It's a minifigure, there's not really any building&nbsp;going&nbsp;on. 1/5</div><div><br></div><div>Parts: All the pieces are great, especially the pie and hat. 5/5&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Playability: Not that much you can do with it by itself, but with an audience or more clowns,&nbsp;there's&nbsp;some fun. 4/5&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Value for Money: Yes, this is definitely worth the 2.99 5/5</div><div><br></div><div>1/5 + 5/5 + 4/5 + 5/5 = 15/20 = 4/5!</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,5

The face is a full make up happy clown face and a really nice brick. The colourful shirt and spotted tie work well although the blue hat may have been better black as there is plenty of colour on the shirt? Hopefully a black bowler hat will come out in Collectable Minifigures or Monster Fighters?<div><div><div><br></div><div>The cream/custard pie is an excellent piece and makes the clown complete. I don't know if shortness makes extra funny points in Danish clowns but it makes this clown more varied than the first and they can of course be interchanged to make more variants. To be honest they could probably churn out endless variants of these but like the skate boys, its best to move on to new minifigure ideas for making the most of each series.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite misgivings of repeats, the flower print hat, pie, face, white gloves and colourful design make it really worthwhile.</div></div></div>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,1
"AETerry","2011-09-26T12:33:55.037Z","Small Clown Review","I missed out on the Clown from Series 1, so this little guys seems like a perfect way to ""make-up"" for not having gotten him. Like many clowns, he is a colorful character and what makes him truly unique and stand out are his bowler style hat and his pie. As someone who enjoys the ideas of new accessories for some MOC ideas, the pie is a must. Those looking for the short legs for kid characters or other, this figure is a good source for another pair of those short legs.<br><br>If LEGO ever decides to do a Circus set, I'm sure this guy, the Series 1 Clown and Ringmaster would all fit in perfectly with it. The detail work and accessories really make this figure and thus the $2.99 for one is decent pricing. <br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,5

Nice printing on the torso as well, and as a bonus, you get a little cream pie and a&nbsp;hat.&nbsp;The minifigure can hold on to the cream pie, and looks quite good when it does. The minifigure comes with a stand as well, and looks really good when put with other minifigures.<br><br></p><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>A great minifigure.

The character looks very cool and we also get a new mould for the bowler hat and the pie. The markings on the torso and on the face are very detailed as well. I really can't complain about this minifig and I think this is one of the BEST figures of series 5 so far.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"woodall_aidan","2012-04-23T09:57:32.757Z","8805-9 Small Clown","This figure is one of the best in Series 5. The clown has a bright blue bowler hat with a red and yellow flower on it. It, like many other parts with the Collectible Minifigure theme, is an exclusive part that is only with this set. The head is white with blue eye makeup and a red clown nose. The mouth is also wide open with a grin. The torso is red with a coat pattern and a yellow tie with green and blue polka dots. The torso also has a blue vest underneath the red coat. The legs are green short legs. The legs are exclusive as they only show in this set in this color. Last, but definitely not least, is the pie. The pie only comes in two sets, one of them being a Friends set and the other being this one. This clown is also compatible with the Series 1 clown. This set easily gets a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,4

<p>This is a great minifig with good printing and an excellently printed flower on the hat. The pie piece is a nice accessory, and it doesn&#39;t come in to many sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p>All in all, a great addition to the Collectable Minifigures line, and goes well with Circus Clown (set &lt;a href=&quot;http://brickset.com/sets/8683-4/Circus-Clown&quot;&gt;8683-4&lt;/a&gt;). In my opinion, an awesome set worth the small price, and if you&#39;re on edge about purchasing, go ahead and get it, because it&#39;s worth it. That&#39;s all for now, and stay tuned for more reviews from me!</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-06T21:39:45.487Z","Small Clown=GREAT figure!","<p>The ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Small Clown. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hat piece, which was actually new to the figure, if I&#39;m not mistaking. I love how it&#39;s caste in blue, and I also love the surrounding rim. And it even has that little flower printed on it, which is just awesome. Overall, it&#39;s a great hat.</p>

<p>Next is his face print, which is also very awesome. I really love his happy expression, and I wanna talk about all the details on it. Right off the bat, it is caste in white, making a painted face design. But he also has some blue eye make-up, some big red lips, and of course, that big, red, cherry nose. Man, I love his expression. He has no alternate face, which is good since it&#39;d be seriously exposed.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which is even more jam-packed with detail. I love how crazily colourful it is, with the red, blue, green, and dark yellow scattered throughout him. Overall, that torso looks crazy good. I like how his hands are also white, but that lack of back torso printing is inexcusable. Still, it looks great.</p>

<p>Next is his tiny, green, short legs, which I love. They don&#39;t have printing, which is okay; they look great just as they are.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his pie accessory, which I think was new to the figure. That&#39;s actually one of my favourite LEGO food pieces ever, and the moulding on the pie crust, as well as the white swirl is just incredible.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! As I said in the previous Series 5 reviews,I love almost every figure here, and this is no exception. I love both the new pieces, and the printing all over him is great as well. Of course, it isn&#39;t worth the hefty three dollars, but I still love the design&nbsp;of this figure, and it&#39;s one of my favourite CMF Clowns. So check out my other CMF reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
