"AETerry","2011-09-01T16:59:27.927Z","Fitness Instructor Review","At $2.99, LEGO continues to hold out at a steady price for these minifigures, I'd prefer a bit cheaper for figures, but these collectible figures often tend to be worth it with the amount of detailing, special and unique prints or accessories they come with.<br><br>Clearly the low ratings for Build and Parts are due to this being a minifigure pack with an accessory, so there's not really much building or very many parts with a pack like this.<br><br>The first thing that strikes me with this figure is that with the 
overall coloring of the outfit and the hair piece being the same color 
and style, that the Fitness Instructor is almost a revisit to the Series
 2 Pop Singer minifigure. So while I immediately think of the Pop Singer, that's not the case. The two figures are clearly different concepts. <br><br>A closer look shows that the head of the instructor has a light green head band for holding her hair back and soaking up the sweat as she exercises. Plus the print is very decent with a clear spandex one piece outfit and blue &amp; green leggings for her work out clothes.<br><br>My main interest in this figure come from it being a female minifigure to give my daughter to play with for her sets and builds as she likes the girls figures. The other is getting a hold of a variant light lavender colored boom box. With the outfit, there's not a whole lot of play I can see being done with her except as being a collectible figure.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,3

"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T11:47:39.257Z","Feel the Burn","<p>Set #8805 Fitness Instructor: There are only so many unique Minifigures that LEGO can create and sometimes those minifigure choices may seem odd, or not exactly what a collector ever considered being interested in. That being said, the Fitness Instructer helps to bolster Female Minifigure numbers and offers some fun 80's retro style to your LEGO Minifigure collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrying a large light purple boom box and dressed in a fitness outfit that may or may not be spandex this Minifigure is fairly unique, she also includes a fun hourglass shaped torso print with a green belt over her pink jumpsuit(?) or whatever you call it. The print is all one sided, she's got leg warmers on her legs though, blue in color with some green thrown in to represent knee pads or something similar to them. Oddly, the yellow of her upper torso (the spot where you'd typically see the neck line of a person) is a strange dull tone compared to the rest of her skin, it isn't typical Minifigure yellow, but more faded. I have to wonder if this is an issue with the paints chosen for the torso.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her face has some great printing choices, with fun expressive eyes, noticeable eyelashes and a big open mouthed smile surrounded by ruby red lipstick. She's also wearing a green headband, again the coloring here is different from the green on her torso, it's much brighter. Making me question the quality of the paints chosen for the printing. Her hair piece is a great item, and one that gives the free flowing long haired look associated with some women. This piece is great for MOCing different Female Minifigures hair types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd say while she's fun to have, and something you might want to pick up to represent the retro 80's era in your Minifigure collection she isn't one worth hunting down on E-Bay for double or triple the value.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"legohpcity","2012-04-11T05:34:12.1Z","Sister, twin or stranger to the pop star?","<p></p><p>The Fitness Instructor was one of my first figures from the fifth series of the collectable minifigures. All the minifigures that I got were random, so I didn't know which minifigures I got. But here's my reviw of her.</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The ""box"" is a plastic bag and the ""instructions"" is a paper with all the minifigures in it. The bag is light blue, like the series 2 bags, but they are a little darker. You don't know which minifigure you get if you just pick a bag. But you can feel the bag and if you want the Fitness Instructor, you should feel for the boom box or her hair. There is also dots on the bottom of the package, but since series 5, they change all the time so it's almost impossible to read them.</div><h4>Parts</h4><div>You get pink legs and a pink torso with prints on it. It's very colorful abd no print on the back of the torso. The legs are also printed. The head has a happy face on it and a band on the fore head that is green. The hair is the same as the pop stars from series 2 and the boom box is the same as the rappers from series 3 but in pink. You also get a black stand that you can put the minifigure on.</div><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""><p></p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><div>The completed minifigure is OK. Many says that the looks like the pop star from series 2. She has the same hair and pink clothes. But the head and the torso does not look so much like the pop stars. The torso has another pink color and the face has an other expression. But they are maybe sisters.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>You put the head on the body, the legs on the body, the hair on the head, the boom box in one hand and the minifigure on the stand! This is not so hard.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This minifigure is not the best from minifigure from series 5 but not the worst. She looks a little like pop star, but it's not that bad. I give the Fitness Instructor a 3/5 LEGO bricks.</div>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-07T23:39:11.563Z","UNDERRATED!","<p>The tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Fitness Instructor. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that wavy hair piece that was introduced in Series 2. The colouring here wasn&#39;t anything new. In fact, it&#39;s the same exact piece as that Series2 figure. But it still looks spectacular, and fits the figure really well. That&#39;s one of my favourite hairs in general, and I just love all the wavy moulding at the front, sides, and back. It would&#39;ve been nice to have got a new colour though.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a really great expression. I love her happy face, with that smile, and I also really love that&nbsp;green headband on her head. She has no alternate face, but that front one is good as heck, so I really don&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which is sporting a pretty great print. I really like that retro look, with the lightning prints on it, and I also like the green belt. And her flesh yellow arms are a nice touch. But it stinks how she has no back printing. That looks a bit bad to me, especially since this is one of the few, older, CMF&#39;s I own. But oh well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have some great printing on them. I love how it has more lightning printing, as well as the blue and green lines. I do think she could use some side leg printing, but it isn&#39;t the end of the world. It has some great printing on the front, still.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessory, which is that light purple boom box. I love that piece, with the silver printing on the front. I also love the moulding in the speakers as well. It&#39;s just a great piece as a whole, and I think it&#39;s exclusive to the figure, even to this day.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, this is a figure who seems to get some hate from LEGO fans, and I don&#39;t know why, because I like her a lot. The hair, the head, torso, legs, and accessory are all great parts. The torso could be better, as it does lack back torso printing, but that isn&#39;t a huge deal. And of course, as I said in all my previous Series 5 figure reviews, I love Series 5 overall, and I like almost every figure in it. This is no exception. But she isn&#39;t exactly my favourite of the whole series, therefore I&#39;ll be giving her a 4 out of 5. And that&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
