"ETAV8R","2011-08-13T16:08:59.333Z","Sideburns and Hat!","Just picked up a few Series 5 and got one detective. Not much to write home about other than his cool sideburns and hat. The hat has earflaps which are tied up to the side of the hat and on those flaps it is printed in a plaid pattern. If you don't have a magnifying glass then he should be a must have on your list. I will probably even pick up a second copy of this figure. <br>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,3

He is afterall an individual that certainly wouldn't mind following Mr Holme's footsteps!<div><br></div><div>This idea alone taps into the playability of this minifigure. Perhaps the LEGO Police will hire him for that mind-boggling case... Or will he be seen snooping around alley ways, looking for evidence and questioning passers by? Use your imagination, because this Detective is a fun and unique addition to what is becoming the best minifigure series to date.</div><div><br></div><div>The cleverest aspect of the product is that, yes, his magnifying glass really <i>does </i>magnify images! Trust LEGO to include such a little detail, but they really don't stop there. This chaps hat actually has the classic 'dog tooth' pattern printed on it which is quite amazing given the scale of hat, and his torso has a wonderful 'check' pattern too. The head is a little more standard with a facial expression of concern, but the side-burns are certainly a nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div>From a distance, this Detective may not be as striking as some of Series 5's other additions, but I feel its main strength is the playability. He can integrate into almost any area of the LEGO City, and for that reason, is a quite essential pick for Series 5.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-02T17:28:10.14Z","Detective Review","Like I commented with the Fitness Instructor minifigure, LEGO is holding at a steady price of $2.99 for the Collectible Minifigures. Which is often worth it given the amount of detailing with special accessories and print designs.<br><br>I had gotten the Detective while trying to get the Woodcutter minifigure and thought I had identified it properly in the bag. Now that I have a couple of him, the figure has grown on me and I find that I am rather taken with it and can think of some scenes and MOC set ups with him.<br><br>The figure fits very much so the Sherlock Holmes image and stereotype of a Detective with the styling of hat and tan tweed outfit along with his magnifying glass. Which if you're wanting to get Magnifying Glass accessories, this Minifigure is a far cheaper way to get one then from the 2011 Police Precinct set or the Batcave set which also have them and are far more expensive.<br><br>It's a fun little figure to have, regardless of if you're out collecting them for a set or to out right play with. All he needs now is a character to be Dr. Watson.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
"QwertyLEGO","2011-09-03T23:00:28.137Z","Magnifying Glass is REAL","This Minifigure is, meh, Okay, but it is good to use for an Adventurers set, or a 1800's London type of set. But, I didnt know that the magnifying glass was real! I thought it was just a cheap plastic piece. So that is pretty cool. It also has nice shade of brown color.<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,2
"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T11:12:09.043Z","Sherlock, without Watson","<p>Here's a great example of a star minifigure from Lego's collectable minifigures line. It's simple, rich in detail, and has that 'cool' factor.<br></p>

<ul><li>-There is a real magnifying glass. <br></li><li>-The plaid shirt is just wowtastic. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Why does the detective have to be an old man?<br></li><li>-The plaid on the hat is interesting, a good detail, but I personally don't have a particular liking towards it. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a great minifigure that, while it has minor personal flaws, is a standout set way above the rest. This is a figure that everyone should have.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-08T00:49:25.54Z","not one of my favourites, BUT...","<p>The eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Detective. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three bucks, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have what might be the most interesting piece on him: that detective hat. That piece was new for the figure, and I have a lot to say about it. First off, I love the colour its caste in, as it can be used in many settings. I also really love the moulding on the sides, with the lines and all. I think the best detail might be that it&#39;s dual-sided. And by that, I mean it has those flaps jutting out from the front and back. And it even has some printing on the sides, which is just fantastic. Overall, that&#39;s a very well-done piece, and it&#39;s my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a great expression. I love that sneer, as well as the dark grey sideburns. That&#39;s a pretty useful expression outside the setting as well. He has no back face, which is great since it&#39;d be seriously exposed.</p>

<p>Next up is his torso, which has some great printing. I really love the button-up design, as well as the lines all over. I think he kind of needs arm printing, but I suppose it can be overlooked. What CAN&#39;T be overlooked, though, is his lack of back printing. That&#39;s just inexcusable, and pretty sad, if you ask me.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, he has no leg printing, so let&#39;s move on to his accessory, which, believe it or not, is pretty interesting. It&#39;s just that normal magnifying glass piece, but the colour its caste in is what makes it special, which is a light grey colour. That colour for the piece is pretty uncommon, and it may even be exclusive. I don&#39;t know much about colours for pieces, though, so don&#39;t quote me on that.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I have some stuff to say about this figure. I want to start by saying, I used to kind of despise this figure, and I thought it was one of the worst in the series. But I&#39;m gonna be honest; once I get a better look at the figure, this isn&#39;t bad at all. It isn&#39;t exactly one of my favourites of the series, but this isn&#39;t one of my least favourites either. It has that awesome hat, that great face, and the printing on the torso is cool too, though it does need back printing. Still, again, not one my favourites, but that&#39;s just because Series 5 has a ton of fantastic figures, so that doesn&#39;t mean this figure is bad. And in conclusion, I actually really like this figure! So that&#39;s all for this figure, and thanks for reading!</p>
