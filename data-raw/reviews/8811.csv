"grandbuilder2001","2011-08-13T04:20:24.433Z","My beard is the best of them all.","<p>I got this set with my pocket money on Friday the 12th of August 2011. I really wanted this minifig so felt through 3/4 of a box of series 5 minifigs. I also got the gangster with this. I also used the dots to find it. So onto the pros and cons...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Easy way to start a dwarf army from the castle(2007) theme.</li><li>Cool accessories.&nbsp;</li><li>Awesome beard.</li><li>Wicked (both ways) head.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The helmet is not that shiny as I thought.</li><li>Bad design for the torso and arms.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>So overall, a good minifigure except for a few minor&nbsp;disappointments. a 9.5/10 from me. The second best male minifig of the series, after the boxer. This is grandbuilder2001 saying 'peace'.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"qitah","2011-08-31T04:35:14.623Z","Short and sweet :)","Ok, so not ""sweet"" as in sweetness and light, but sweet as in awesome! ;) This is one of the darker minifigs from the collectable series 5 - certainly scarier than any of the monsters we've had so far in the CM series. The overall colour scheme is black, dark brown and gunmetal grey, and his face (underneath a bushy black beard) is a menancing scowl with deep set eyes. Evil dwarf, or Gimli with a hangover? I guess you get to decide! <br><br>This minifig has the most parts/pack of all the series 5 minifigs - 9 glorious pieces, and they are all brilliant. Working from the ground up, this is what you get:<br><br>1. Set of short dark brown legs (which don't bend)<br>2. Torso assembley with intricate printing of scale mail overlaid with a jerkin (?) with dragon wing motif and a belt with a dwarf head buckle - the wings on the jerkin and the belt buckle are highlighted in a rich copper hue, which is very nice. <br>3. Gunmetal and black shield with printed dragon head's motif picked out in bronze.<br>4. Short reddish-brown bar piece - shorter than the wand pieces in the HP sets, which is very useful.<br>5. Two gunmetal axe heads, to attach to the bar. (Interestingly enough, on the promo pics the axe heads are speckled silver-black, not gunmetal) I have to say, i'm fine with the gunmetal. :)<br>6. Long black beard with a part in the front and ponytail at the back<br>7. Scary, bearded (he's got a beard on his beard!), scowling face, as mentioned before.<br>8. Large winged dwarf helmet (as per the fantasy castle sets) in gunmetal grey.<br><br>So yes, a plethora of useful parts, especially for castle fans. If you missed out on the fantasy line, this is yr chance to bulk up on dwarves!<br><br>If you are looking for this minifig by feel, i'd advise either looking for the helmet or the shield, using one of the axe heads to confirm. The beard is kindof easy to feel too - it's a hard, boxy U shape, with a knobbled surface. <br><br><br><br>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,3
"AETerry","2011-09-06T13:55:17.287Z","Evil Dwarf Review","One of the best minifigures out of Series 5. But then I'm a fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy, so a figure like this holds a lot of appeal.<br><br>Low ratings for Building and Parts of course come from the fact that this is a minifigure. There really isn't much of a build aside from assembling the minifigure. <br><br>Detail wise, he is just beautiful. His axe head and helmet feature the new metalic grey plastic that LEGO has been using this year (2011) for Castle. His beard is an obvious homage to the Dwarves of the Fantasy Era theme.<br><br>I don't think I would exactly call him evil. He does make the perfect complement and companion to the Elf Minifigure for anyone who got him. <br><br>It's a figure like this that says the $2.99 is worth it for one of these guys. The dwarf will be proudly displayed in my collection.<br>",TRUE,5,1,1,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T12:01:29.82Z","The Deiwar Never looked like This","<p>Set #8805 Evil Dwarf: Another Fantasy Era Minifigure in the Collectible Minifigures range, and one I was extremely lucky enough to find, a must own Minigifure and here's why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all he's a Dwarf, and LEGO Hasn't made too many of those available, there were what? Less than 20 Dwarf Minifigures included during the Fantasy Era, and none of them were EVIL. This guy has a ton of character for a Minifigure, starting with the standard viking style helmet typical of Dwarven Minifigures, we see he's got some nice dark coloring in the stone grays, earth browns and blacks department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His large black dwarven beard covers up a lot of the torso and facial printing, however that doesn't mean you have to keep it on, if you prefer a shorter bearded evil dwarf you can leave the large black piece off so you can get a look at this awesome printing. He has bushy black sideburns leading down to his beard, bushy black eyebrows and his frown coupled with the evil light brownish tint surrounding his eyes makes him appear to be in a very bad mood indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His one sided torso print showcases Dwarven chain mail, in keeping with the fact he is meant to be an EVIL dwarf his upper chest has dragon wing designs, his belt buckle is a Dwarf's head and the little pouches printed onto his belt are fastened closed with sharp looking animal horns. Or I should say, what appear to be the horns of a bull design-wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly he includes a nice double-sided short axe, built with a brown lightsaber blade piece and two axe head pieces, and his shield matches the stone gray color of his helmet with a dragon's head print square in the middle of the small rounded shield. It's mouth open in a menacing roar. Quite frankly I'd have to say this is one of the better offerings from Series 5 and if you're lucky enough to find one, or more than one, definitely pick them/him up. He's a nice compliment to the Elf from Series 3, with one fighting against the other to protect the land from this EVIL Dwarf.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4

The dwarf has a cool shield and axe and the head and torso are awesome! One of the best from series five. ",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Bram","2011-12-03T06:04:51.7Z","Intimidating lil guy...","This guy is one of the shorter one in the series 5 lineup, but he's got the most menacing look and not to mention the most imposing axe that seems to weigh twice his weight LOL. This one is actually pretty high on my wishlist.&nbsp; The finely detailed helmet, the axe which consists of three separate pieces,fine print on his shield and torso and the fact that his face is almost burried behind that beard and moustache really give him a lot of dwarf character, and no he doesn't look evil at all actually despite his name in the series..but yeah he does look intimidating.<br><br>Sealed packaging notable 'feels':<br>You can't really miss the huge helmet with that protruding wings on the side, and the huge axe. <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-08T15:46:25.67Z","a MENACINGLY GREAT figure!","<p>The twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Small Dwarf. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes a whopping 10 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting this figure off, we have that battle helmet, which looks great. I don&#39;t know whether it&nbsp;was new to the figure, but if I had to guess, I would say it was. I just love that moulding so much, with the big horn-things jutting out of the sides. I also really like the little knobs surrounding the rim, and the spike on top is pretty fine as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is pretty hard to see, so you&#39;re gonna have to trust me on this one. His expression is a bit angry, mostly due to those big, bushy eyebrows, and he has this extremely bushy, black beard covering the face. He also has those highlights around his eyes, which adds to the menacing look. He has no back facial printing.</p>

<p>Next is his beard, which looks great. Once again, I don&#39;t know if that was new to the figure, so if it is, that&#39;s great, and if it isn&#39;t, it still looks good. I really love the braids hanging down on it, and the moulding for his bushy moustache is great. That piece actually hangs down the back of his torso too, which looks really great. Overall, I think this beard piece might be my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some really incredible printing. I love all the armour on it, as well as that big, menacing belt buckle. I also love how his arms are caste in that deep grey. Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t have any back printing, but it can be excused due to it being covered by his beard.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have no printing, but they still look fantastic. I think using small legs is genius, and the dark brown colour of them works extremely well for the overall figure, so all cool there.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessories, the first of which is that shield. I love how small it is, and I love how the figure grabs it from behind as well. But the best part of it is the menacing printing on the front, which looks creepy and great. But that&#39;s not all; he also includes that battleaxe, which is made u of 3 pieces. That dark brown pole looks awesome, but the axe blades clipped onto the top are great. I love the sparkle detail on it, and it adds so much to the figure.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! As I&#39;ve said in some of my other Series 5 reviews, I love almost every figure in Series 5, and this is no exception. All his piece are incredible, and I mean ALL. And for the first time, this actually feels like a 3 dollar figure. Another reason I like this so much, is because my brother got this figure back in the day, and he passed it down to me, which means a lot. And since I&#39;ve found all his pieces, I&#39;m able to enjoy all his great detail, which is why this gets a solid 5 out of 5 for me, and he&#39;s one of my favourites in the series. And that&#39;s it for the figure, so thanks for reading!</p>
