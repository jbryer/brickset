"andrew0893","2011-09-04T07:36:51.673Z","New Pieces!","<p>The boxer in this set is super awesome. The whole minifigure,yes, the WHOLE minifigure all the parts are never before seen. As I was in Singapore when I bought this at a Lego store,it was sold at about$4 SGD which is about $2 in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to identify</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its easy just feel for the boxing gloves which are attached to the torso OR Just use the codes which you will find on brickset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The helmet and head</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helmet is a cool new piece which have 4 little holes on the top of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is a dual-sided head with one side having a ""ready to fight"" look with a golden mouth guard printed on it.The other side has a ""beaten up"" look with the mouth looking lke this ~ and a black eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The torso</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new piece,I did not know that the gloves are attached to the torso before&nbsp;I bought it. The torso has his rock hard abs and a wrestling belt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legs</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new piece again,looks like he is wearing shoes and somme tight shorts as you can see some yellow on the legs.Overall the legs are cool.</p>

	I really like the Series 5 Collectable Minifigures. One particularly well-made minifigure of series 5 is the boxer. Even though it&#39;s a quick build, it&#39;s definitely worth it for $3.<br />
	Pros+<br />
	+Nice boxing hands<br />
	+Double sided head<br />
	+Great &quot;helmet&quot; piece<br />
	+Useable sweat pants piece<br />
	+Chest torso with trophy-belt<br />
	Cons-<br />
	-Top teeth are golden, which can be good or bad<br />
	Overall, this set is great for $3, and definitely one of the better ones of Series 5!</p>

"AETerry","2011-09-07T12:42:56.53Z","Yo Adrian!","The Boxer to me is clearly one of the better minifigures offered up in Series 5. He's very well detailed and with some unique pieces and prints. His gloves are very unique, being attached to the arms instead of the regular hands of a minifigure. The helmet is also very distinctive too and for me was one of the easier pieces to feel by touch when searching for him on the rack. The face then has two sides. One for the champion and then the other side which shows him having taken a beating and not looking so good. Print jobs for the torso and leg are great too in the same line that many of the CMF are very well printed.<br><br>The value for this figure at $2.99 is still worth it. I can always hope for cheaper, but I wouldn't want to pay more then that for this one. And personally, get at least two of this one if you're into doing MOCs. Otherwise, he displays very nicely with the rest of the collection.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T12:20:55.513Z","IN THIS CORNER...","<p>Set #8805 Boxer: Series 5 really started bringing LEGO's A-Game when it came to Minifigure decisions and ideas. This one is a great addition to any LEGO Minifigure collectors collections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the Sumo Wrestler of Series 3 the Boxer has a bare chested torso, he's not as pudgy as the Sumo though. And his lower torso has gone one better than the Sumo by including a boxing belt to symbolize his victory in the ring. His legs include printing on the sides to indicate his shorts, with gold trim, the yellow where you can see his bare legs however has washed out some, just like on the Fitness Instructor. It isn't as bright as the Torso.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One side of his head features a print with a open mouthed smile, his upper teeth almost appear to be fully gold, as though he's lost them all while fighting. The back of the head includes one black eye, a closed squiggly lined mouth symbolizing his beating and an almost tired look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, with the unique hat piece and the fact that this Minifigure actually has red boxing gloves for hands, coupled with his impressive though slightly washed out printing (for the lower legs) he's a Minifigure worth owning, and definitely strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-08T18:05:50.717Z","great pieces, great figure!","<p>The thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Boxer. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that boxing helmet, which was a new piece for the figure. That looks awesome, especially caste in that red colour, and the moulding on it looks spectacular. I like the round top, as well as the smooth sides. It&#39;s just a great piece overall.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has not one, but two great expressions. That main one, as seen in the image, has a pretty happy look, and I like the little mouth guard piece in his mouth as well. But I like his alternate face a lot more, where he looks really bruised and a bit scuffed up. That face is brilliant, and very useful as well. That actually might be my favourite head piece in the whole series.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms, which is incredible. First off, the torso has some great detail, with that black belt, and the muscles look nice as well. It really stinks that he has no back printing, as it would&#39;ve been nice to get more muscle detail. His arms have no printing, but that&#39;s okay. But let&#39;s get down to it: his boxing gloves instead of normal minifigure hands is just awesome. Those look downright fantastic, with the thumb moulding, and that whole situation was new to the figure as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his legs, which have lots of pleasant detail. The red wrinkle detail on the front looks nice, and I love how his yellow flesh is poking through. He has a bit of side leg printing as well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I love every piece on this figure, especially his helmet, head, and hands. The concept of the figure is really cool as well, and it&#39;s a very original idea. And like I said in my previous Series 5 reviews, I love almost every Series 5 figure, and this is no exception whatsoever. And that&#39;s all for the figure! Thanks for reading!</p>
