"AlHazred","2011-08-21T02:12:51.177Z","Cleopatra","<p>While the name of this minifigure is ""Egyptian Queen,"" it's pretty clear that it's meant to be Cleopatra; she's probably the most famous one, and the only one most people will have heard of. That said, this is still a nifty figure: she has the sloped base representing her dress, a torso with a distinctive Egyptian-style dress and the womanly curves that identify a female, a heavily-made-up face, and straight black hair of moderate length. All in all, she strongly resembles Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal in <span style=""font-style: italic;""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_%281963_film%29"">Cleopatra</a> </span>(1963).</p>As such, this minifigure is a little dark for LEGO. Normally, LEGO avoids the more negative aspects of life. However, this figure comes with a snake as an accessory. The significance of the serpent is this: rather than become a prisoner and trophy of war, Cleopatra killed herself by allowing herself to be bitten by a poisonous asp smuggled into her prison by a servant. That's about as dark a suggestion as I've ever seen in LEGO.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nicely detailed.<br></li><li>Female minifigure; females have historically been underrepresented in LEGO products so it's nice to get some variety.<br></li><li>Historical interest.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Limited reusability; I'm not sure how many scenarios are going to call for an Egyptian Queen minifigure.<br></li></ul>
<p>All told, I like this figure. It'll never be extraordinarily useful with most sets, but it's got some historical interest. If you did a lot with <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Time%20Cruisers"">Time Cruisers</a>, then it might be more useful.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"clundsberg","2011-08-30T15:07:10.777Z","Watch out for snakes!","<p>I am very excited today as I received 4 of these from LEGO.com and they were all different characters.</p>
<p>Cleopatra here is one very pretty figure:&nbsp; The bright blue highlights against the intricate gold print on a field of white (robe) is simply beautiful.&nbsp;The blue&nbsp;colour&nbsp;is also used as her eyeshadow and gives her&nbsp;perfect lil LEGO face a very dreamy quality.&nbsp; Her hair is made of hard black plastic and&nbsp;accentuates the Egyptian look well, it also features a gold and teal headband print.&nbsp; For as bulky as the hair might seem when putting this mini together, it's a very tight fit on her head which was a nice surprise.</p>
<p>The only piece that is seemingly unoriginal is the snake.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, it makes sense (or alternately they could have molded a gold staff or ankh) just stating the obvious.</p>
<p>Overall this character is great and a nice welcome espeically with all of the Egyptian themed sets this year. You will not be sorry with any of these minis, especially the Egyptian Queen.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-08T16:42:49.653Z","Egyptian Queen, a.k.a. Cleopatra Review","It only makes sense that many of the CMF packs eventually have a female counterpart to them such as the Snowboarder and Caveman for example. So it's fairly clear that if they'd done a Pharaoh early on, that eventually they'd do a counterpart to him.<br><br>That aside, she is a very well done and decent figure and she sets along quite nicely with my Pharaoh minifigure for display purposes. Her dress is done in the familiar lower base triangular piece with distinct printing for showing the era and style of dress for Egypt. Even her face with the kohl around her eyes and her hair piece are beautifully done. The snake however seems like a clear after thought to give her something to hold as an accessory piece. <br><br>Outside of her collect-ability factor and possibly using her with the Pharaoh's Quest theme, there doesn't seem to be too many options on using this figure in play. So she's obviously worth it to collectors. She's just not a figure that jumps out and has numerous ideas on what to do with her besides display.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,2,4
"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-09T22:09:33.943Z","8805-14, Queen of the Desert","<div>First of all, I have to offer serious kudos to clundsberg’s <i><a href=""http://mst3k.wikia.com/wiki/Eegah"">Eegah</a></i>&nbsp;reference in one of the reviews preceding mine. Second of all, nothing about Egyptian Queen’s appearances suggests that she is Cleopatra VII, because she, after all, was not merely a queen but an actual pharaoh - but I see her as Cleopatra, too, so I don’t offer many other counterarguments to that.</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless, Egyptian Queen is a detailed and appropriate translation of stereotypical imagery of Egyptian royalty, and she plays the role well. The inclusion of the snake is pretty dark, as was mentioned by an earlier reviewer, since legend has it that she induced an asp to bite her and therefore kill her with its venom in lieu of being captured by rampaging Roman forces. Recreate one of histories most famous suicides with your family! I mean, why not?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love the historical Collectible Minifigs most of all, and I certainly hope LEGO includes at least one or two of them with each iteration of Collectible Minifigs. My dream is to one day have a Minifig to represent each empire in the <i>Civilization </i>series, which may just happen if this Collectible Minifig lark carries on with as much steam as it has had so far. Any ideas for an MOC of <a href=""http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Ramkhamhaeng"">Ram Khamhaeng</a>?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
"sideswinger","2021-04-08T18:28:18.003Z","a pretty good figure!","<p>The fourteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Egyptian Queen. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair piece, which is Egyptian as heck. It looks just plain brilliant, and it was new to the figure as well. The very smooth moulding all around it is brilliant, and it even has that little printing on the top. It&#39;s just a great piece overall, and is probably my favourite part of this whole figure.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a fantastic expression. I do wish it had more Egyptian-like detail, but I suppose that blue eyeshadow will work just fine. She has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which has some great printing. It looks perfect, with the gold, white, and blue colours. I also really like how her yellow arms are exposed. But she has no back printing, which stinks. I think she looks a little incomplete without it.</p>

<p>Next is her dress piece, which has some nice detail. Of course that is the older style dress, and the printing on it is exclusive. I like how her gold and blue printing carries on from the torso to the dress, and that&#39;s just a great design overall.</p>

<p>And lastly, her accessory is nothing special. It&#39;s just that green snake, which was a classic piece back then, but nowadays, it&#39;s a little boring.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I love almost every figure in Series 5, and this is no exception. Her hair is the stand-out, and her other pieces are pretty cool too, though she does lack back printing. And her accessory is a bit lame. But still, I like this figure, so I&#39;m gonna give her a 4 out of 5! And that&#39;s it for the figure, so thanks for reading!</p>
