"Nesquik","2011-08-09T05:18:09.84Z","Gangster almost gets away with it...","When the Gangster was first seen in the leaked promotional images, their was no doubt that people asked ""How do Lego keep coming up with these ideas?"". Everything about the Minifigure oozes character - highly detailed pin-stripe shirt from the 1930's, the carefully attended moustache, those thick eyebrows and menacing expression as his victim is cornered...<div><br></div><div>So why the low score? It more or less comes down to the quality and design of the 'Violin Case', or what passers-by don't realise is the Gangsters way of hiding his gun! It first and foremost can indeed open and the gun may be stored inside, but this requires a ridiculous amount of fiddling to do. The 'grasps' that keep the case closed are two tiny pieces of exposed plastic that simply lock in front of each other, and so you'll need fingernails to prise them apart. Failing to do so carefully simply bends and scratches these 'grasps', until once you've opened and closed it several times (if you even manage), they appear worn out.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to this, the main joint that holds the two sides of the Violin Case together at the base is exposed as a white mould (white, because the plastic is either poor quality or too thin) that looks ugly when the Case is held up. Once again, we a promotional image simply doesn't reflect the real life product.</div><div><br></div><div>If it wasn't for these issues then the Minifigure would be an instant 5-stars, but seeing as how this problem was found to the same for all the 'Gangsters' we opened, it will just have to be accepted.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,5,4
"hollywood_heidke","2011-09-01T21:59:35.05Z","Great, not perfect, but great.","<p>I love this minifigure.&nbsp; It realizes all of the character one would expect from an old school gangster.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1:&nbsp; The hat, violin case, face, and torso are excellent.</li><li><br></li><li>Pro 2:&nbsp; It is a completely unique minifig to add to the collection.&nbsp; None of the Collectible Minifigures up to this point are very similar.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: As stated in other reviews, the bottom of the violin case is made white due to stress on the plastic.&nbsp; This is similar to what happens with the 'book' pieces from some Lego sets.&nbsp; I would have preferred that Lego made the violin case a solid piece of ABS like the boom box piece carried by the Rapper or the Jazzerciser.&nbsp; I don't see myself opening the case anyway.</li></ul><br>The pros outweigh the cons.&nbsp; To be honest, the con doesn't bother me much at all, and doesn't hurt my score.&nbsp; A 5/5 from this AFoL.<br><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-09-09T12:54:50.397Z","Gangster Review","At first glance, the Gangster makes for one of the better minifigures out of Series 5. From the concept, to the pin stripe suit, his gun, face with mustache and hat, even the violin case he's carrying. He puts me to mind of expanding on the Indiana Jones set Shanghai Chase scene, adding more gangsters going after Indy, Willie Scott and Short Round.<br><br>Value wise for this figure, the $2.99 shows that it is worth getting these figures for the amount of detail work and unique accessories that come with them.<br><br>Though there is a downside to this figure and it is his violin case that was all exciting at first to see and get. The bottom as many have pointed out already, is white from the stress put on the plastic from folding it. The clasps are very tricky and I'm worried about the case breaking and getting ruined from repeated opening and closings. There's an old Vacation Camper set that I got, that came with a little grey suit case that eventually ripped and came apart and I can see the same thing happening to this violin case. <br><br>It is very neat and cool looking, it adds a lot to the character of the Gangster. Just be forewarned that the case has every appearance of being highly fragile and more than likely will not hold up under the stresses of repeated handling and play.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T20:04:33.327Z","Violence with Violins.","<p>Set #8805 Gangster: With Series 5 Minifigures LEGO Really began hitting their stride, some of Series 4 were also cool, unfortunately I only ever managed to get two of that series. The Gangster introduces a really cool new piece, for the first time ever we have a LEGO Violin Case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gangster starts off really neat by featuring Indy's hat in black, you wouldn't think that style would go very far outside of Indiana Jones' Theme, but LEGO prooves us wrong by including it with many of the Collectible Minifigures.</p>
<p>His facial print shows some interesting lines that may be age lines, indicating this Gangster has survived into his late fifties or so, he's got large eyebrows, a wide open mouth showing his tongue and upper teeth and a small&nbsp;pencil thin&nbsp;mustache. All in all he's got a fairly impressive facial print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The torso print shows a pinstriped suit from the 1950s' he's got a white tie, four large buttons on his suit and a small white handkerchief just poking out of his pocket. It is a really neat looking torso print, if only it were a double sided torso it would have been really impressive. He also has a small pistol, which can fit inside the violin case. Yes it does open, I am however a little bit leery of opening and closing it too many times as the hinge joint is rather thin and came out of the package very stressed out. So it is possible the piece could snap in half after too many times opening and closing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I can't recommend this Minigifure enough, he's got a great looking facial print, a unique new piece for possible MOCs and could even fit in with any Super Heroes/Batman displays, even in spite of being a Yellow Toned Minifigure and not the new Flesh Toned ones that those Themes use. He'd certainly make a great henchman for the Penguin or Joker.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"Bram","2011-12-03T05:44:42.223Z","Easy fix for this potentially wonderful figure","This gangster minifig is actually pretty low on my series 5 wishlist. The main reason is the puny pistol..I mean he's got that mean 30's gangster attitude, he should be totting a huge Tommy Gun with that circular magazine case which is the real mobster favorite weapon of choice to 'clean up the mess' as they said LOL. It's a huge letdown that Lego failed to realize this. With that small pistol, he looks more like a cowboy in a fancy suit. <br><br>Some easy DIY improvements:<br>1. Ditch the pistol and swap for a better Brickforge's military riffle/machine gun.<br>2. If you hate that ugly white-out joint in the violin case which shows up, a black permanent marker should conceal it or dab of flat black plastic modelling paint.<br><br>Equipment/weapon aside..this is a wonderful figure which captures a typical 1930's mafia hitmen.<br>",TRUE,4,1,4,4,4
"POWERCARTOON_","2011-09-05T09:00:27Z","Great Fig , bad item","<p>This minifigure is a great choice for building up a mafia gang&nbsp;or some Indiana jones bad guys , but!</p>
<p>The case he has with him ruins the whole thing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>SERIOUSLY BAD CON</em>: <strong>The Violin case-The design is great but the fact it is made of weak plastic is a real downer.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i first got this i thought this was going to be one of the best figs until after only 1 min later , the violin case looks like a lego piece bitten by young&nbsp;children , and i handled the piece very carefully too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Anyway getting off that subject</em></p>
<p>The shirt decal is fantastic (Although i wish it was at the back too) , the hanky in&nbsp;his pocket is fab and the stripes along the shirt makes it&nbsp;him a&nbsp;great gangster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:<strong>His shirt decal</strong> (Very different)</p>
<p><strong>Nice hat</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fab looking grin on his face.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic pistol gun is also included with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall , i still don't mind getting him but i would get rid of the violin case personally (Unless of course if you never touch it)</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-20T10:37:48.107Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 5) - Gangster Review","This gangster somehow reminds me a little bit of the gangsters we got in the Indiana Jones set Shanghai Chase (set 7682). But maybe it's because of the hat and the suit which this character has. I really like his grin on his face and we also get a revolver and a violin case where you can store his weapon. It's one of the BEST minifigs of series 5 so far and I really can't complain about this figure.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-08T21:44:31.02Z","one of the WORST, but I like SOMETHING...","<p>The fifteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Gangster, and this figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hat piece, which is that cowboy hat piece caste in black, which isn&#39;t the most common colour for it. Believe it or not, the cowboy hat works for the figure. It isn&#39;t exactly a very special piece, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is his face print, which has a great expression. That looks pretty evil, with that creepy grin, and the little moustache is good as well. He has no alternate expression, which is good, since it&#39;d be seriously exposed.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has an okay print. It isn&#39;t really that special, as there are several torsos like that. And to be honest, those prints probably have an advantage to this one, as this figure doesn&#39;t even have back torso printing, which is pretty bad, in my opinion.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, so let&#39;s move on to his accessories, the first of which is that pistol. That piece isn&#39;t exactly rare, but it works for the figure, so I don&#39;t mind. However, that violin case looks fantastic. It was new to the figure, and I have a lot to say about that piece. First off, I&#39;m just in love with the shaping of it, and how smooth it is. I also really love how it can open, and I think it can actually fit that pistol inside as well. I like how it has a stud on the narrow side of it, and I like the flat bottom. And no; it is not a &quot;body bag&quot; like some might say; it&#39;s used to store guns, and gangster things. Another interesting thing, is that I wonder if it can fit the Series 21 Violin Kids violin piece, because that would be awesome.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, that violin piece is pretty darn incredible, but the rest of the figure isn&#39;t that great. Like I said in my previous reviews, I love almost every Series 5 figure, but this might be an exception. And if it weren&#39;t for his violin case, I&#39;d give him a 1. However, that violin case bumps&nbsp;rating up to a 3. And that&#39;s for the figure! Thanks for reading!</p>
