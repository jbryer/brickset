"AETerry","2011-09-15T11:44:32.48Z","Snowboarder Guy Review","The quality of the minifigures in the Collectible Series are frequently very good. Even if I don't like a particular figure itself, as long as LEGO holds to this level and standard of quality, then the $2.99 for them is good. Would I prefer the lower $1.99 for them? Yes, but I wouldn't want to pay more for these figures.<br><br>I do rate low for building and parts due to this being a minifigure. There just isn't that much of a build. It's assembling the minifigure and then their one, maybe two unique accessories.<br><br>That said, the Snowboarder is a good little figure for a Collection. He's certainly not the worst figure ever done. I do find him charming and I like him far better then his female counter part from series 3 that I have seen. The print job for the snow goggles over his eyes is good as is the print job on his torso for looking like he's well bundled up against the elements and cold. His hat is a solid dark blue beanie. His one accessory piece (that makes the minifigure in this case,) is his snowboard with a decent print job on it too.<br><br>Completests are sure to want to pick this figure up. Those who like to just grab up a few figures will have a decent figure to work with for their MOCs and play.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,3,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-21T10:18:17.85Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 5) - Snowboarder Guy Review","This minifig is a great addition into any LEGO collection for sure. The torso looks very cool and I also love the details on his face and the markings of the snowboard piece. I also like his hat which is the same mould as the one we got with the street skater back in series 4 - except for the markings and the color. I really can't complain about this character.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T20:16:16.08Z","Relax and Shred some Powder","<p>Set #8805 Snowboarder Guy: The last of my Series 5 Recent Acquisitions to review, this Minifigure isn't too bad, however I doubt he'd be one you'd have to get unless you're completing the line. Somehow I wound up with two of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the Female Snowboarder from Series 3 this one features a bit of a more casual look than the helmeted competitor of Series 3. He's wearing a touque of dark navy blue, and his facial print is mostly hidden behind a large pair of snow goggles. The snow goggles themselves however are pretty sharply defined and detailed, and his bright smile shows that he's having some fun while shredding the snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's dressed in a somewhat lighter colored blue jacket with a big zipper straight down the centre of the print, with two pockets on either side and what appears&nbsp; to be a smaller zip-up pocket on his upper right breast. His hands and legs share the same gray coloring, and his board, this piece is now white instead of black with a picture of a mountain on the top and some circular designs on either end of the board. He also has a 48MM printed on the lower right hand corner, not sure if it means anything, but it's pretty interesting for LEGO to include it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, while I would say this one can be very easily skipped, he does at least complement the female snowboarder from Series 3, and does come with some nice printing, and the parts can be used in MOCing winter sports or winter display dioramas.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-04-09T02:02:08.447Z","a BAD figure!","<p>The sixteenth and final figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 5 is the Snowboarder Guy. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hat piece, which is the Series 2 Skier hat caste in a dark blue. I think that was new to the figure, and it has some good moulded detail all around. But it isn&#39;t the most special thing out there, so that&#39;s a bit sad.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a good print. I like the smiling expression, as well as those orange goggles. He has no alternate expression, however, which would&#39;ve been great, but oh well.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some decent printing, with the azure jacket and the zipper. But he has no back torso printing, or arm printing. No arm detail is okay, but the lack of back printing is inexcusable, and it looks pretty bad.</p>

<p>And his legs have no printing, although they do have a nice colour. His snowboard accessory, however, looks pretty good overall. I like the printing on it, which is exclusive to the figure. It has two studs on top as well, so the figure can stand on it.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I&#39;m gonna be completely honest: I sort of hate this figure, not gonna lie. As I&#39;ve said in my previous Series 5 reviews, I love almost every figure in Series 5...almost. My last review was of the Series 5 Gangster, which was an exception to my love of this series already. But that figure was a little excusable, mostly because of his violin case, and because the idea of that figure was very original;&nbsp;<em>this<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>figure, however, is absolute crap, no excuse. He has no interesting parts, no amazing prints, and it&#39;s a gender swap within two series, as the female Snowboarder was in Series 3, and even that was an overall boring figure. But we also had the Skier in Series 2, and the Ice Skater and Hockey Player, both of which were in Series 4.My point is, I&#39;m burnt out on winter sport figures, so it was gonna need to be a fantastic figure to excuse that. But THIS is the exact opposite of a fantastic figure. I just find myself extremely disappointed by this, especially since I love almost every other Series 5 figures, and it&#39;s a good series overall. And while this figure isn&#39;t enough to ruin the series, it&#39;s by far the worst figure in it. And on top of that, this is NOT worth three dollars.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m done ranting, so check out my reviews on all the other Series 5 figures, and Series 6 reviews are coming soon. And thanks for reading!</p>
