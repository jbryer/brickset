appearance of Harry, Ron and Hermione in to the Lego world. But there 
was always some other theme sets that I had my eye on. I missed the 
opportunity to purchase the 9V motorized Hogwarts Express train and have
 regretted it ever since.&nbsp; I kept looking at the train set and thought 
to myself&nbsp; that I would get it&nbsp; next time I return to the Lego store. No
 luck.&nbsp; <br>
I purchased this set because it was a mini kit, a Harry Potter set and a
 train.&nbsp; I wasn't expecting anything special about it. No special or 
unique parts. I wasn't highly&nbsp; impressed with this set is a train and a 
Harry Potter set.</p><p><br></p><p>13 easy steps to put together. Nice little train.&nbsp; Has a few extra pieces left over. <br></p>",TRUE,3,1,1,2,4

If you missed or don't have room for the full sized set, this is a wonderful little teaser build. With 64 parts, it takes just a few minutes to build. The little wheels are just flat out adorable. We had fun rolling it back and forth on the table during dinner last night laughing the whole time. Sometimes you just purchase a mini set because it is FUN! Forget to ask how many unusual parts it utilizes....who cares?<div><br></div><div>It is a wonderful gift for your favorite train enthusiast; hubby loves it! The red color scheme is perfect, and the 3.99 US price at five below takes the cake. Polybags are becoming some of my favorite items when they are as well designed as this one. Face it, there are just too many LEGO themes to collect more than a few. This set allows you to get a better taste of HP without buying the whole line. And think of what you are doing for the environment (and your bank account) by substituting a tiny set for a large one!</div><div><br></div><div>So turn on your tea kettles and get the steam rolling for this little choochoo, best enjoyed with a nice cup of tea....yup, we drink it in the New World, too.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5
