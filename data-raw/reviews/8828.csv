<p>This set comes in a slightly larger polybag with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice parts in this set. You get two three leaf plants, a brown staff, and a red 2x2 rounded plate. The red and black pieces (while common) look and work well together. The card you get is of Sensei Wu. It is a 3-D card&nbsp;and certain parts of it pop out looking really cool. The total piece count for the set is 98.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me around 5 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice Card Shrine. The build is simple and easy. It really has that Shrine/Japanese look to it. The white dish with the 2x2 rounded red plate really look good as well as the two lanterns on either side of it. The two three leaf plants with the brown staff add to the base of the shrine as well. The red and black colors while simple work great with this set. I recommend this set to any Ninjago fan/collector. If you aren&#39;t a fan of Ninjago then this set probably isn&#39;t for you. If you do get it will look very nice with anyones collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
