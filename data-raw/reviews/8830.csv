"legoDad42","2011-09-10T23:24:48.327Z","Great Ninjago for the Beginner Builder!","<p>DK Publishing has produced some wonderful LEGO books and the <strong>DK Brickmaster NinjaGo Book </strong>is no exception.</p>
<p>As a parent and AFoL I highly recommend ALL the DK Brickmaster books for the young/newbie/beginner builder (5-6 yr. olds on up to about 8 or so. After that age they'd want and can build more elaborate kits). They come with a finite amount of bricks to build various scenes, vehicles, etc. within a theme plus 2 minifigures. </p>
<p>The builds are fun and fairly simple at times which is great for the young/beginner builder to quickly have a sense of accomplishment as well as fun vignettes to play with. Even though of course you can add more bricks to elaborate on the scenes, having a finite amount of bricks helps with creativity and will definitely help them with larger more elaborate kits as they grow with LEGO.</p>
<p><strong>DK Brickmaster NinjaGo Book</strong> comes with over 140 bricks and elements to <em><strong>build 15 different models</strong></em>&nbsp;plus one Ninja of Fire Kai and one Skeleton Army&nbsp;Soldier Frakjaw.</p>
<p>Below I'll post all 15 models with brief descriptions and also you can find more pics and various angles of the models on my Flickr <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/51289111@N05/6134128235/in/set-72157626320844323"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/51289111@N05/6134128235/in/set-72157626320844323</a></p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> 15 NinjaGo models (5 of which are vehicles...and one being a Mech!)</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> 47 pages of clean, clear, crisp instructions on high quality paper (with Brickmaster building tips throughout).</p>
<p>- Unlike other Brickmaster DK book, this book has you follow a basic story as you build the various NinjaGo scenes. Good fun for parents and kids to elaborate on the storytelling aspects of LEGO.</p>
<p>- 2 mini-figs: Ninja of Fire Kai and Skeleton Army Soldier Frakjaw.</p>
<p>- Over 8 weapons.</p>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<p>- Even though all the models are fun for the kids (especially the Mech), the first 4 scenes repeat themselves too much (meaning vehicle and shrine, vehicle and shrine, etc.). More variety needed from the designer.</p>
<p>- For the catapult, they should've had extra 1x1 round pieces and flame elements since we know once fired, those projectiles will just get lost often.</p>
<p>- No spinner for Kai (I think that's a big oversight here) and Frakjaw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Scene:</em></strong> <strong>SWORD of FIRE!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DOOM BUGGY...</strong></p>
<p><em>...love the printed tile piece of the 'red' skull here...</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The RED NINJA SHRINE...</strong></p>
<p><em>...nicely designed arch and&nbsp;weapons racks left and right. Here's a good opportunity to add more racks for more weapons, build more scenery with extra bricks from your collection...</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5425.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5439.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5445.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The SPINNING FIREBALLS CATAPULT...</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scene: SPINJITZU SHRINE!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ROCK RACK...</strong></p>
<p><em>...even though there is a 'bone staff' here, they should've had a unique weapon for Frakjaw. Also, with the extra's from this scene see how I made a very simple Rock Rack that can hold the extra bone piece http://www.flickr.com/photos/51289111@N05/6134151489/in/set-72157626320844323/</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The SHRINE of SPINJITZU...</strong></p>
<p>...3 traps here protecting the Sword of Fire: Camoflaged spikes, spinning sword trap, wall of flame (close up of these on my Flickr)...</p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5457.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scene: NINJA ATTACK!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CART of BONES...</strong></p>
<p><em>...flying the flag of the Skeleton Army with the front fender built&nbsp;from&nbsp;the bones of his enemies...mwahahahahah...</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5474.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The SACRED FIREPLACE...</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The SHRINE of SACRED FIRE...</strong></p>
<p><em>...Altar for the Sword of Fire with spinning catapult and a weapons rack...</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5477.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scene: BATTLE for NINJAGO!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAMOUFLAGE...</strong></p>
<p><em>...needed more bamboo leaf elements (just like 2 more). Also with the extra's from this scene you can still build a simple catapult launcher </em></p>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5482.jpg[/img] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The MONSTER MACHINE...</strong></p>
<p><em>...even though you've had some cool little vehicles and vignettes your kids would love and play with, here's the payoff, the Monster Machine Mech Suit, complete with flame thrower, duel flick-fire missiles, cockpit, etc. and somewhat possable (both arms tilt left and right, turns/swivels at hips and both legs and be turned outward)...</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5525.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>...Parents, for your young ones, definitely pick up any of the Brickmaster sets. They're great for the beginner builder with fun scenes, vehicles and cool figures. Great for mom and dad to build and enjoy with their kids. Also for additional bricks for these types of books, check eBay for sellers just selling the parts pack that comes with each particular theme.</p>
<p><em>Price-wise, I picked this up for just over $19.00usd at Walmart.com (normally this book retails for $29.99usd).</em></p>

"thechabear","2015-06-09T15:17:43.503Z","race for the golden fire katana","<p>Hello everyone and welcome to a ninjago&nbsp;review. This is the first ninjago review from me but not my last. This is a good brickmaster (most of them are good anyway) and maybe the best one. Lets take a look.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box(book)/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The book has a opening in the cover which you take the bag with all of the parts out. The whole book is a instruction manual and you can build many things.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The good parts are:</p>

<p>the minifig parts</p>

<p>the weapons</p>

<p>the printed skeleton&nbsp;tile piece</p>

<p>the two skeleton heads</p>

<p>the bone pieces</p>

<p>the curved arm pieces</p>

<p>plant pieces</p>

<p>most of the parts are good</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>KAI 2011 (1st outfit): YES FINALLY a easy way to get this minifig. This is $20 or $30 dollars and is the cheapest way NOW to get Kai 2011. It used to be the spinner or the polybag but this is still on sale. &nbsp;He has the old ninja hood with the clip on the back of it. His torso has the fire symbol on it and has some cords connecting with the symbol. On his waist, it has the red belt. On the legs it has the belt coming back down from the waist. No back printing. The face is the normal kai face. He comes with a gold katana.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/njo007.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FRANKJAW: Maybe this minfig is better then Kai. This version of Frankjaw is the one without armor. This version of him only appears in this set and the polybag that was only &nbsp;with the mail in Europe. He has a skeleton face with some metal stuff on the top. He has a basic skeleton torso and his legs are the booted ones. He has a belt on his waist. He wields a bone axe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/njo023.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The building experience</h3>

<p>Very peaceful and relaxing</p>

<p>time: 10 minutes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model: model 1</h3>

<p>4 builds in model 1. Lets look at them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FIRE CATAPULT: &nbsp;A simple build but needs more of the cylinder flame pieces because they get lost easily. Overall can shoot but a minor build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5406.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RED NINJA SHRINE: This is the biggest build but not the best. The left and right sides can move back and forth. The center hump place is for the &quot;sword of fire&quot;. There is 4 other weapons: an axe, 2 spears, and a black katana. Next to the altar theres 2 plants and two red pole pieces. This leads up to the lamps and red\white place which are on all shrines. Overall not the best but in the middle</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5425.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SKULL CAVE: The 2nd biggest build , the skull &quot;cave&quot; should be called the skull prison. The bones can be hinged so that kai is trapped in the bone cage. This is one of the better prison methods that lego has created. Inside there are white bars in the back and a smooth floor. On top there is a 360 degrees skull shooter which are flick missiles with skull heads on them. All of this is build on a tan 4x4. Overall 2nd out of 4 good builds</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5415.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE DOOM BUGGY: Let me get this out of the way. This is the best build in model 1. It moves good and is like the juniors cars. It has the engine in the back (I found this weird) and a printed skull logo on the hood. It has a steering&nbsp;wheel and frankjaw can standup on it. Overall best build in model 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5401.jpg"" /></p>
