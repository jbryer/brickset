	I bought this set because it was unusual and it looked good and I wanted to support children in need. Now on to Pros and Cons.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Good value for money</li>
	<li>
		Cool little bandage</li>
	<li>
		Interesting building techniques</li>
	<li>
		looks good</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Eye patch spins round and doesn&#39;t like being over his eye :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Overall I would say that this is a really good little set and (apart from my little niggle with the bandage) I would recommend it to everyone.</p>
