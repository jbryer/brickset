It is&nbsp;available through the Lego ShopAtHome and Lego Brand Stores. We bought ours in the Copenhagen Brand Store at the very high price (for what it offers) of nearly US$55. In the USA&nbsp;the price is US$35. That is Lego's international&nbsp;price policy for you. Anyway, as we sort of collect Lego Games and really like the Heroica theme we ""had"" to get it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what you get is&nbsp;the following:</p><ul><li>A fold-out play board/mat.</li><li>A rugged storage case designed to hold the content of one or more Heroica games.</li><li>A small 17 bricks container/items holder.</li></ul><p>The play mat is the greatest part of the set. It is made of quite strong cardboard and folds out very easily to&nbsp;cover&nbsp;an area of&nbsp;81x51cm. Thickness is&nbsp;about 4-5mm. It has a nice graphics landscape clearly&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;be used with the first four games in the series (Draida, Waldurk, Nathuz, Fortaan) connected to each other.</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/AndreasL/ReviewImages/heroicamap500px.jpg[/img]</p><p>When these four games are connected as shown in the games' instructions the resulting landscape will match the features of the game very nicely. For example&nbsp;the waterfall&nbsp;of Draida is close to a depiction of a waterfall on the mat and bridges over water are close to depictions of rivers, etc.</p><p>The map has the name of the four current games and also indicates the direction of the future expansions into Elsbuck (east), Seldaan (south east), Barresh (north) and&nbsp;Drandora Port (south). Only the name of the ninth expantion, Ilrion (further east), is missing. Whether it is possible to fit&nbsp;more than the first four&nbsp;game sets&nbsp;on the map is yet to be seen, however, it is doubtful as the four themselves&nbsp;take quite a large part of the&nbsp;mat area. Therefore, when the future expansions will arrive you may need to add some cardboard or similar to hold these next to the mat to compensate for the height difference between the mat surface and the&nbsp;table surface.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The design of the storage case is very similar to the ones previously delivered with minifigure Chess games like the Viking Chess Set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=G577-1"">http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=G577-1</a>) and the Castle Chess Set. The case has a handle for carrying it around and two straps to keep it closed during transport.</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/AndreasL/ReviewImages/castlechessset500px.jpg[/img]</p><p>The only differences from the Chess sets&nbsp;are the graphics on&nbsp;its sides and the design of the vinyl snap locks designed to hold the game items.&nbsp;In this set the&nbsp;vinyl locks&nbsp;are designed to hold a limited number of the Heroica microfigures, dices,&nbsp;inventory holders and&nbsp;game world pieces. The reason I write ""limited"" is that although the description on the Lego SAH says that it can contain the content of all your Heroica games then it does not offer that much space in reality.&nbsp;It is very hard to make room for the first four games that the mat is clearly designed&nbsp;for. Not even the microfigure&nbsp;snap locks&nbsp;match the number of figures in the four games. Therefore, unless you want to split all the larger game&nbsp;parts into their individual pieces and rebuilt them each time you want to play then you need a separate box for these. What does fit is most of the road pieces, the hero inventory holders, weapon racks (although without weapons attached), dices, enemy creatures and all the other small items of the games.</p><p>To compensate for this we currently use the following for storing the first four sets of the Heroica series:</p><ul><li>The storage box for roads, microfigures, smaller items and the play mat.</li><li>A&nbsp;second box (the Fortaan box) for all the larger game features (like the ruins of the Waldurk Forest).</li><li>A&nbsp;third box (the Waldurk box) for the game instruction books.</li></ul><p>Not ideal but manageable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the 853358 set is an expanded hero inventory holder. Instead of the normal design this one has a Lego box/crate attached&nbsp;underneath for extra room for small items or slain enemies. Not really useful but better than nothing, I guess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very sturdy and well designed play mat.</li><li>Play mat adds&nbsp;a lot of atmosphere to the game world.</li><li>Storage box is nice to look at and easy to carry around.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Very expensive for what you actually get.</li><li>Storage box cannot contain all the items of the four games it is designed for (unless you want to rebuild&nbsp;the larger game features&nbsp;everytime you play). You will need extra storage for the buildings and game instructions.</li><li>Quite useless ""exclusive"" inventory holder. It would have been better with a small addition to the game world that added to the atmosphere or gameplay.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>A must for Heroica fans. Others may want to think twice before buying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,2
"davee123","2011-09-18T10:51:52.55Z","Misleading","<span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The board is nice, and the quality is pretty good, but it failed to do the crucial and implied task of storing multiple Heroica games well.<br><br></span><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">In
 order to store each game, the game tiles need to be disassembled quite a

have to be taken apart more completely.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>But
 in addition to disassembling the game tiles beyond the point of 
comfort, it also will not fit more than 2 Heroica games. It could ALMOST
 fit all 3 of the smaller games, but not quite. There aren't enough 
spaces for monsters, decorations, or any of the different sized tiles 
(except the largest 8x8 tiles).</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>The
 saving grace is that you can use it to store your own custom Heroica

 other aspect is the board. It's quite nice, and is large enough to fit
