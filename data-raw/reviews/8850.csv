<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>More cards to try</li><li>Use for '?' tile on die</li><li>Challenging for those that are skilled</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Pieces do not add to building versatility&nbsp;</li><li>Many challenges are near impossible to create</li><li>Orange and green tiles do not have printed logos on them</li></ul><div><br></div><div>All in all, a disappointing expansion. &nbsp;A deck of cards would have been better, but with the same ?,??,??? Difficulty gradients. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; A future expansion set that focuses on useful parts would be a better addition to the game experience. &nbsp;We have modified our Creationary set with sideways building parts and a few unique pieces, ie sideways building bricks, brick ended hose, 1/4 curves, triangle with ball joint, etc that has improved play and made some builds less frustrating.</div>",TRUE,2,1,1,1,2
