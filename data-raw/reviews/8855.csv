The Minifigure is completely incompatible with others, the arms are stiff, the torso cannot be removed, and the helmet doesn&#39;t fit with other figures as its made to keep a metal rod through it. the cape is normal. The other pieces the pen comes with are fun, the silver globe like piece is fun to add in builds and the transparent discs are interesting.</p>
