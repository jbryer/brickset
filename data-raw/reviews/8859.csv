<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son got this spinner starter set a week ago. It had a good prize in the store (14euro), so okay with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to 2011 starter set I think the 2011 one (nr2257) is a better one regarding the spinjitzu gameplay. The cards in this 2012 set are not as good/fun and useable to be a true starter set. So if you start with spinjitzu 2257 is recommended a tad more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In it self set 9579 does contain a few good pieces and still enough fun to start spinning. Or even better to add to an existing spinning collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cole ZX is cool character and his sword holding backpack is just plain cool. The golden weapon is quite the large!</p>
<p>Rattla the snake does some hard hitting with the snake weapon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arena is straightforward easy. Moves around when spinning. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowns add some variety to the spinners. And old vs new spinners does not make a difference. My son wins.... hahaha.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp; The box is a simple cardboard plate with the contents in a plastic cover. I just cut out the part with the characters and weapons on it for a&nbsp;reference.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp; The parts in the set are really cool. The new sai weapon is what I was wanting all year last year. The new vipers are really awesome, too. 2012 spinners look different from the 2011 ones, which I like. Finally, the spinner crowns add another level of color and stability for the entire set.</p><p>&nbsp; The cards are also very useful for the actual game. LEGO made some nice new ones this year.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp; Cole ZX - Good decal, good armor. I like the new ZX shoulder pads, and the new helmets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Rattla - Rattla has some cool decal, and a good new headpiece.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp; Just to let you know, I'm basing the build on what it <i>should </i>be, not what it <i>could </i>be. The arena is a simple build, took me about a minute. If you ask me, the real building takes place while switching the weapons and crowns on the spinners.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp; The completed model is a neat game which your whole family can enjoy. It looks really nice when it's fully put together, too.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, a great set. Just because it's not a LEGO build you would usually see, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. The fun you have makes up for it anyways!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
