Upon saying that, it probably leaves one wondering where I'll start... relax, I've had ample time to calm myself. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Shall I start with the Cons?"" It might be a silly question but I will... and given this set, I might just finish with them as well. *Sigh* Even you American buyers will be sticking it to uncle sam on your next tax return upon being asked to pay $20 for the Training Set. I suppose interest is already relatively low, however, It would not seem right unless I completely close the door on the prospect of someone considering this set. What drives the price of this set up is undoubtedly the manufacturing costs of those accursed tops! Some may throw a little party having received the news about them being away from China, but that wasn't about to save you any money in the long term. Tops, new and old, all look sturdy and all that really mattered was the quality of the little gem (minifigure) you'd place on top. </p><p>Speaking of a minifigure... you'd be a&nbsp;little disheartened to learn that underneath the kendo outfit is the exact same torso/legs that were heavily produced in the first/second NinjaGo lines. Perhaps of greater insult is you can actually buy these parts on Pick-a-Brick... making the minifigure in this set completely useless to a collector like me. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have watched your share of Storage Wars, Pawn Stars, or&nbsp;American Pickers episodes, but your NinjaGo spinners aren't going to hold any value unless you keep them sealed in the packages. I'm not making promises for some potential in 50 years, but maybe (as a collector) you could find some niche market of ""that kid who wants to complete his childhood hobby"". It's a stretch, but the mods probably wouldn't like it unless I had something nice to say. Opening this set at all, will destroy its packaging (as you may very well know if you've purchased a magnet set). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you're somehow that entranced by the backdrop and have money burning a hole in your pocket then I suppose you could... check yourself in to see a doctor! Fortunately NinjaGo is huge among kids more than adults. Even if one or two sets completely miss my expectations there are more than enough whiney brats out there who have parents willing to concede to their demands. </p>",TRUE,2,3,1,4,1
"Rolyat24","2012-06-11T11:03:07.283Z","Great For Spinjitzu Fans!","<p><b>9558 Training Set</b> is a combination of a Ninjago set and spinner, making it more interesting than the average spinner. &nbsp;There are some cool parts, and the minifigure isn't bad. &nbsp;It is a little expensive (due to the spinner) at $19.99, but I bought this set at my local Target at full price, although I may regret it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box was rather disappointing. &nbsp;It is, as with all other spinners, blister pack: plastic glued to a back sheet of cardboard. &nbsp;I had been hoping this would come in a regular box due to its&nbsp;build-able parts. &nbsp;The package can really only be used once, so for reselling it's best to keep it new. &nbsp;The good part about these packages is that it is obvious if part is stolen. &nbsp; Anyway, the box shows everything included and also has some ads for other sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions, however, are different. &nbsp;It does include the sheet of paper folded into a rectangle that every spinner comes with, explaining&nbsp;Spinjitzu&nbsp;and it's uses. &nbsp;What surprised me though, was the fact that it also came with two instruction booklets. &nbsp;For such a small set, I found this very odd. &nbsp;I think if Lego took all of the ads out of the booklets, it would fit into one. &nbsp;Altogether, the instructions were easy to follow and didn't present any problems.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div><b>9558 Training Set</b>&nbsp;came with a few cool parts. &nbsp;The head of the snake, for example, was printed, which pleased me very much. &nbsp;The rest of the snake was done with stickers. The transparent lime green parts which make up the snake venom are extremely cool and you do get quite a few of them. &nbsp;The set also includes four ""brick bricks"", the brick that looks like a brick. &nbsp;Together, these parts make the model more interesting.</div><div><br></div><div>The spinner is orange and grey, printed with the fire dragon sign set into stone. &nbsp;It does have the holes on bottom for the blade accessories. &nbsp;This is definitely not the best spinner out there, so I don't recommend getting this set only for the spinner. &nbsp;The new piece (crown) that fits on top is wonderful. &nbsp;It's silvery-grey with black designs on top. &nbsp;The shape is really neat and adds to the ""spinning"" effect nicely. &nbsp;So although the spinner isn't anything special, the crown is quite nice.</div><div><br></div><div>I was again disappointed by the weapons in&nbsp;<b>9558 Training Set. &nbsp;</b>&nbsp;It includes eight very common weapons and nothing special at all. &nbsp;It even included doubles of weapons. &nbsp;There is a brown stick, gold stick, black katana, silver katana, grey scythe blade, grey dark&nbsp;ax, a spear, and a golden darkblade. A snake staff or a build-able weapon would have added nicely to the set.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though I don't use the cards, they are Kendo Kai, Spin Circle, Extinguish, &nbsp;Blinding flash, and Backflip.</div>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>Kendo Kai is the only minifigure in&nbsp;<b>9558 Training Set</b>&nbsp;and this is the cheapest way to acquire him. &nbsp;Kai has his normal outfit on and has the same head as usual. &nbsp;The only difference is that he sports samurai armor and a fencing helmet. &nbsp;The armor is cool, but allows no place to store a weapon like the ZX armor or ninja wrap. &nbsp;The helmet looks more like a hockey mask than anything, but it was a nice detail to have the grates white while the hood is grey. &nbsp;Once again, no sheath, but it is the first headgear to show more than the ninja's eyes. &nbsp;Overall a very nice minifigure and great to add to your collection.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was rather simple and takes at most 20 minutes, at least 5. &nbsp;Nothing about the build was very difficult. &nbsp;Lego used some interesting&nbsp;techniques to design this.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The completed model looks fantastic. &nbsp;Before buying this set, I was unsure of the snake, but after building it was obvious that a lot of time went into designing it. &nbsp;The idea is that when a spinner spins into the tail, he is rewarded with a weapon. &nbsp;This works really well and adds a lot more fun to the model. The snake tail can also be positioned thanks to the hinge pieces, as can the head. &nbsp;On either side of the snake is a chute where the weapons come out. &nbsp;One is designed to look like the Serpentine, the other for the ninja. &nbsp;The chutes hold most weapons and as long as they're small enough, they slide out smoothly into the playing field. &nbsp;On the sides of the chutes are the weapon holders, which are simply designed yet smart thinking on Lego's part. &nbsp;Also included is half of the battle arena.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div style=""text-align: left;"">Overall,&nbsp;<b>9558 Training Set</b>&nbsp;is an excellent set with a few minor flaws: the weapons and packaging. &nbsp;$19.99 is definitely a little steep and a discount price would be a whole lot better. &nbsp;Buy this set? &nbsp;That depends. &nbsp;If you enjoy&nbsp;Spinjitzu, this set is for you. &nbsp;It includes a nice crown and an excellent playing arena. &nbsp;In it for the parts? Then I'd pass. Although a few cool parts are present, the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9440-1"">Venomari Shrine</a> might be a better choice. Ninjago minifigure&nbsp;enthusiast? If you don't have a Kendo ninja, it might be worth it. &nbsp;If you collect every single minifig, this is the&nbsp;cheapest&nbsp;way to get Kai in Kendo form. &nbsp;In my opinion, the Kendo ninjas are all the same, so if you already have one, don't bother with this set. &nbsp;However if you, like me, just love the Ninjago line, this is definitely a set for you!</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,5,3
