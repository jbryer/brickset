"Rolyat24","2012-01-06T17:16:33.457Z","Good, compared to 2011","<p>I picked up this set at my local Kmart, mostly because I was excited about the new figure. &nbsp;It was also because I had gotten the Jay booster pack, before I realized that some of the cool features only work on a 2012 spinner.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The packaging is nothing new, just plastic and cardboard like all of the other Ninjago spinners. &nbsp;This isn't too good because you can't store the pieces in it once it is opened. &nbsp;Also, in later years, when trying to sell it, the box would be useless. &nbsp;The instructions came in two sheets, one with instructions and one with adds about other sets and weapons. &nbsp;Quite boring, considering we have Brickset.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts were mainly the spinner, weapons, and cards. &nbsp;The cards are a bit different then last year, but still have Kai on the back. &nbsp;You get four cards. &nbsp;The three weapons are an ax, snake, and mace thing. &nbsp;The ax is golden, which is pretty cool, but nothing too special. &nbsp;I don't see how a snake is a weapon, but it is. &nbsp;The snake is green, the same color as Lasha. The third weapon is a pole with a chain attached to the end, with a tooth on the end of that. &nbsp;It has a transparent green piece as well. &nbsp;I don't know what to call it, but it works really well with the spinner. &nbsp; The spinner is, as I said before, redesigned. &nbsp;A new piece is added to the top, which looks like snakes. &nbsp;the bottom is redesigned. The spinner is purple on top and grey on the bottom. &nbsp;It has green designs and the extra pieces are green (I still really don't know what these are for). &nbsp;The new spinner design works better and looks cooler. &nbsp;If you want to buy a spinner, look for a 2012 one.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The only&nbsp;mini-figure&nbsp;present is Lasha, a lime green snake from the Venomari tribe. &nbsp;His front has a snake design on it, along with some read water balloons(?) The hands are black, but I don't see why he has hands in the first place. &nbsp;Lego should have made a special&nbsp;mini-fig&nbsp;for the snakes. &nbsp;The hood is cool. &nbsp;It is lime green with dark green markings on the front. &nbsp;The face has 3 eyes (4, but one is scratched out), a snake&nbsp;tongue, and two fangs. &nbsp;Overall, I think the&nbsp;mini-fig&nbsp;is excellent and I will certainly be getting more snake-figs.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There isn't much of a build at all. &nbsp;You build the figure the way you build any other one. &nbsp;The weapons are all assembled except the mace. &nbsp;You only have to add the round piece to the spinner and then it is finished.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks great with all of the green, contrasting with purple. &nbsp;There is a lot of playablility, but only if you have another spinner. &nbsp;Otherwise, it's pretty sad.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So basically, if you enjoy building, this set is not for you. &nbsp;But if, like me, you love&nbsp;mini-figures, then I strongly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this to help build your snake army. &nbsp;I mean, all it really is is a glorified&nbsp;mini-fig. &nbsp;At US $9.99, it isn't such a great deal. &nbsp;I would wait for it to go on sale. &nbsp;But if you want it, you should buy it while it is still in stores. &nbsp;I suspect the price will rise a lot on eBay after it's off the shelves. &nbsp;Overall, it's a great set to add to your Ninjago collection, and I am sure I will be buying more spinners later this year.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,3

The cobra headpiece is individualy wraped for those&nbsp;who are wondering, and also seems to be made of a different plastic than usual, more bendy. His build is not much, hood on head, head on body, body on legs. I must say, his head is very detailed, with interesting design choices. His weapons are nice, but if he is a snake, why is he using another snake as a&nbsp;weapon? Some may like that, others may not, but I found it humorous. His golden weapon is a fairly standard axe, and his buildable weapon is a tooth on a chain It flails around the spinner, and works well with the function. The spinner is purple, grey and has a green peice on the bottom.&nbsp;The crown has 2 snakes on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, the main deterrent with all the spinner sets is the price. 10 dollars for 21 pieces! I understand the spinner is a special piece, and is therefore more expensive, but looking at the set based on the value of pieces, It lacks a lot. Good set for playability, but not so much for value.</div>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-08-24T10:03:01.1Z","LEGO Ninjago - Lasha Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 21 pieces and it is 10 USD. That means that the price per 
piece ratio is 5 cents per piece which is a really good value for a set 
like this.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig is awsome. I think it's one of the best LEGO Ninjago snake villains ever. The lime green on his torso, head and legs is really cool and I also like the markings on it. We also get a double-sided torso.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/9562-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>The set comes with some very cool and useful accessories.

in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-26T15:07:36.85Z","Venomari Scout","<p>Set #9562 Lasha: Ninjago Spinners are great for kids who love playing the game, they are also great for Mini-Figure collectors on a budget, while the price in Canada is a bit high for the content and number of pieces it can still be benficial to pick up these things. Especially for the Ninjago Game Cards, those things look so cool, they're like TCG cards and impossible to resist.</p>
<p>In this spinner you recieve Lasha the Venomari Scout, a dark purple and medium black colored spinner with venom spitting print for when the Serpent Crown is attached, three weapons a Golden Axe, the Chained Fang of Poison and a Toxic Viper, three pieces used to build a card stand and five cards. (Lasha's Character Card, Toxic Venom, Armory, Lazy Ninja and Close Call.)</p>
<p>The spinner works great, it spins fairly fast as all spinners tend to and looks suited to Lasha or any other Venomari Tribe member. The weapons are nice too, you get one of the green snakes, that's always a plus, and better to see than typical weapons such as swords or spears. The Golden Axe is a bit bland, if it weren't for the fact it's gold you'd just have another LEGO Axe from the Castle Era. The Chained Fang of Poison is one of the better weapons, it's made out of four pieces and the set comes with an extra white tooth piece.</p>
<p>Lasha is a great looking Mini-Figure, most of the Serpentine I've seen tend to recieve a wonderful level of detail put into them, much like the new Legend of Chima Mini-Figs are getting for 2013. Lasha has a double-sided torso with scaled printing, some flasks attached to a belt full of extra venom, and the scaled pattern carries down onto the legs. The flared Cobra Head Piece is a nice new piece, all-in-all I'd have to say Lasha here reminds me a lot of Kobra-Kahn from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. His face printing is pretty neat too, with four eyes (one of them clawed out) a forked tongue and two little fangs poking out of his mouth, Lasha is a menacing looking villain.</p>
<p>Overall, you can't pass up this spinner if you're a fan of the game or looking for a cheap method to pick up some serpentine Mini-Figs. It is tricky to find these older spinners these days, I got lucky and found one lone Lasha at a local London Drugs store, which was having LEGO 20% off. If you find him and still need a few characters to complete your collection try not to pass him up.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
