"Binnekamp","2012-12-07T14:16:20.657Z","The mysterious samurai... an underrated gem.","This set hasn't been reviewed yet, and it's a shame as this is one of the better spinners and it's a bit underated. This is definitely my favourite Januari 2012 spinner. Here's why;<br><br>Samurai X, or 'that samurai' is only available in this set and in 9448 Samurai Mech. Like all 2012 spinners, the set is made of good quality plastic. Here, this warrior is seen performing spinjitsu on 'his' spinner. I was highly anticipating the samurai mech, but I still bought this for the minifigure and 'his' weapons.<br><br>The main reason to buy this set is the minifigure. I absolutely love it. It's as close to perfection as the mech 'he' pilots. <br>Unlike some skeletons I can name, Samurai X is well armored from head to toe. 'He' wears the samurai armor piece first seen in the Ninja theme from 1998, but now in a new color, gunmetal. The helmet is made of three new pieces, the helmet and neck protection, the mask and the 'horns'. The red samurai mask hinges like a visor but it always goes back into one position and it can't be used as a visor in itself. The helmet is less wide than its ancestor from 1998 and it's more detailed from the back. The horns are angular pearl gold bucket handles upside down, and they are not as ornate as the metallic gold horns from 1998. This is the only flaw of the minifigure, but they can be replaced, and it's not that big a deal.<br><br>Under the armor we find out that 'he' is a she; Nya! Although the face print is the same, the dual sided head now sports a more fiery alternate expression where Nya is anything but calm, as she is gritting her teeth. Intrestingly, she doesn't wear lipstick with this expression.<br>Her torso shows feminine shaped grey armor with her Phoenix symbol on some armor plates. Her back shows some straps to hold her armor together, held by a Phoenix symbol. Her legs are printed as well with grey armor with golden highlights.<br><br>The minifigure comes with three weapens, a golden sword with the square guard, a beautiful black 'butterfly sword' not seen since 2004, and a red and black spear. This spear is made of a black lightsaber handle, a red 4L bar and a red 2,5L blade, only seen in this set.<br><br>Although arguably not a normal lego piece, the spinner included is quite the interesting inclusion. It has been upgraded from the 2011 spinners, as it has been fitted with (technic) holes on the now flat underside to accomodate the new booster packs. The studs are now hollowed to allow the placement of minifig tools or snake teeth (Lloyd Garmadon booster pack). The set comes with a 'spinner crown' to give an advantage in the spinjitsu game. The crown is red with black stylish flames printed on it, and the gunmetal spinner has the phoenix symbol on all four studless corners. It's a shame that they aren't transparant to evoke the 'revolving energy' feel, but that couldn't be helped.<br><br>For those who enjoy the Spinjitsu card game, this set comes with 5 cards, one character card, rookie archer, boomerang (golden card), double duel and whirlwind. It also comes with two red 2x1 bricks and a 2x2 plate to act as a stand.<br>Even as a standalone set trying to hit things with the spinner can be fun, but having other spinners to fight with is necessary to really play the game.<br><br>To conclude, this spinner set has a lot going on. As a fan of Samurai X, this was a no-brainer, but even I had to wait for (at least a little) discount before I could bring myself to buy it. The minifigure is well equiped with a lot of unique or rare weapons and acessoires and the spinner is one of the nicer looking ones from the first half of the year. The value for money is higher than usual, as the character comes fully equiped with all these great parts.<br>I would recommend to pick it up on discount, as the price is a bit steep for what you get. If you like samurai or if you want a cool enemy/ally for your other characters (to the ninja 'he' can be both!) then I would recommend it, but take some consideration if you are on a tight budget.<br>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,3
