($4.99 instead of $9.99 USD)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jay the Lightning Ninja comes in one of these booster packs.&nbsp; Jay has upped his outfit this time around, as he had new torso printing, new armor, and a new helmet.&nbsp; While all these are nicely detailed, the best of them is his new shoulder armor, which doubles as a backpack sword-holder.&nbsp; Much like the one from Prince of Persia, the new backpack allows Jay to carry two katanas.&nbsp; When the swords aren't inside it, there's a round hole that shows off the lightning emblem printed on Jays back.&nbsp; This is overall a nice design, and works much better at holding swords than the old Ninja helmets.&nbsp; (Although, to be fair, it doesn't work for anything besides the katana pieces.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jay also comes with some extra weapons an accessories.&nbsp; He has three weapons; a standard silver katana, a long pike that utilizes the new dagger piece, and then a flashy gold spikey thing that is made using two new gold blades and a gold chainsaw piece.&nbsp; He also comes with three spinning blades that can be attached to the bottom of a spinner, and two blue spikes that can be attached to the top.&nbsp; Furthermore, the pack comes with a character card, four battle cards, and a small instruction book with the rules for the spinner game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it has the potential for the playability of a standard spinner set.&nbsp; In fact, I think the weapons and spinner armor are actually cooler this year than last.&nbsp; (Although I noticed that the spinning blades don't fit under the old style of spinners; the new ones must also have a new design to them.)&nbsp; With other spinner sets, this is a great set, because it gives you an awesome minifig with plenty of accessories.&nbsp; It does fall as a stand alone set because you really can't play the game without a spinner to put the minifig on.&nbsp; (Also, you need a second player with their own spinner... so the game requires you to purchase a few of these guys).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, for a parts collector, a Ninjago completist, or an avid spinner gamer, this is not a bad set to pick up.&nbsp; But if you don't like the minifig or the weapons... well, you can save some money and get something else from the Lego aisle.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3
"AETerry","2012-02-03T12:27:22.987Z","Jay ZX Booster Pack Review","<p>Overall, I have to say I like these Booster packs for Ninjago better than the actual Spinner sets. They're a bit like a souped up Collectible Minifigure and where I love a lot of the Minifigures from Ninjago, I don't necessarily want the Spinner sets.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The package is not quite a polybag but more like the bags that the Collectible Minifigures line comes in. And there's a sheet of folded paper that's not exactly a set of instructions, but it does give an explanation of rules, weapons assembly and some ads for other Ninjago Spinners.<br></p>
<h4>Parts and Minifigure<br></h4><p>There are 28 pieces in this bag. Most of which are weapons for Jay who is in his ZX outfit. There are some minor pieces beyond this meant for the spinner, but can be useful in other builds.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>I have to say that I love these Booster Packs more than the Spinner sets. Yes, have a set of spinners in the Starter set. But it just feels way too pricey and wasteful to constantly have all of these Spinner sets for a Minifigure and it's spinner. You don't really need that many and the booster packs are clearly more economical in this sense. Get your figure and you won't have a million spinners laying around that aren't likely to ever see use.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-09T04:29:01.22Z","LEGO Ninjago - Jay ZX Review","<p>This is a very useful set to have and it's a nice addition into any LEGO collection for sure.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 28 pieces and it is 5 USD. That means that the price per piece ratio is 18 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for a set like this.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks very cool. We get some new printings on the torso and we also got a printing on the back. We also get a very detailed armor piece with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/9553-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has some very useful accessories with this set. We get 3 blades which you can put underneath the spinner and we also get a nice looking staff, a katana, two daggers for your spinner, a cylinder piece which has some grooves in it and a chain saw which has a dagger on each side. We also get some very nice looking cards with this set.<br></span></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2012-11-07T23:33:20.143Z","NINJAGO! A Theme worth looking at.","<p>Set (Set?) 9553 Jay ZX: As a fan of LEGO first and foremost I will admit that I know very little about the Ninjago Theme, and more importantly I know next to nothing about the Ninjago Spinner Game. What I do know is that I've been hooked, and for me it's all about the Mini-Figs. But more importantly it's about fun, collectibility and bargain prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not really a set, not in the traditional sense, it is referred to as a Booster Pack. Within the nifty looking envelope resides a small bag full of LEGO pieces and another bag protecting five cards from being bent. (Though I suspect it would take a lot to bend them.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO's Ninjago Theme is both a game and a series of sets in the traditional sense. With an overarching storyline created by the television series, and fun characters for Kids to get behind, LEGO's Ninjago Theme captures much about what is fun with LEGO. It also incorporates a brand new aspect, an attempt to cash in on similar styled schoolyard games, like Bakugan or Pokemon TCG. This is what you need to understand before chooseing to pick up this set for any child interested in the NINJAGO theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jay ZX is a glorified Collectible Mini-Figure, he includes accessories used to enhance the spinners of the NINJAGO game. You aren't building anything here, so much like my CMF reviews we'll simply focus on the details and other elements. First of all there is Jay ZX, a great looking little Mini-Fig, his primary color is blue, with silver and gray detailing, his printing is excellent, with some great detail work on the ninja belt and gi that he is wearing. There is also a backprint, fairly small, that shows an elephant's head. (If I'm interpreting it correctly.) Jay ZX is LEGO's answer to a Power Ranger it seems, speaking from a character standpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He includes three different weapons, a ninja sword (capable of storing on his shoulder armor's back sheath), a long staff/spear type of weapon using one of the new LEGO Sai pieces, and the golden weapon (which I am not about to attempt to determine its name until I get the Ninjago Character Encycolpedia) which is made up of three seperate pieces. He's really armed quite well, and I especially love the fact that he can hold all three weapons in some fashion with the sword on his back and the other two in his hands. I also really dig the new ninja mask piece that LEGO has made for Ninjago, this being my first exposure to it, I'm really quite impressed at how far we've come from the old 90's era Ninja Masks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you have spinners to put them on, or play the game, the other parts kind of just sit around. They aren't that impressive honeslty, I'm sure they'll be pretty fun once I get some of the spinners. As I am on a budget and have long wanted to get the Ninjago sets for the Mini-Figures at least, these Booster Packs and Spinners are actually an excellent alternative for the budget minded collector of Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also honestly surprised with how much I suddenly have this urge to collect the Spinners and other sets for the cards alone, the five cards in this set look like any other quality trading cards you'd use in a game with your peers. However the designs stand out a bit more, I don't even think I'll ever play the game, as a collectible enthusiast though the cards are a great added value on top of the Mini-Fig in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this is a solid little set, with spectacular accessories and an impressively detailed Mini-Fig. If your child is interested in Ninjago, and you find it difficult to afford the larger sets to get all of the characters they love from the show, the Spinners and Booster Packs are an excellent alternative for budget conscientious shoppers, especially during the holidays. Pieces could concievably wind up lost or missing after a while if they don't play the actual game. I also would caution you in just getting these and being done with it, as there isn't much in the way of playability with just this one item. Still it's quite a solid little item. I noticed however that, unless stores re-stock these items in large quantities for the holidays, you may find it difficult to locate them. They obviously sell out quite quickly it would seem.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,4

<p>It&#39;s an accessory pack to the spinners, but the thing is the accessories here weren&#39;t as great as others playability and part wise. Building experience was ok. Price is alright for obtaining a ninja figure.</p>
