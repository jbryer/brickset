"AETerry","2012-01-25T13:35:32.79Z","Kendo Cole Booster Pack Review","<p>I love many of the new Ninja minifigures and the snakemen minis that are out with the 2012 Ninjago line. I however don't like many of the sets that such figures come in or the Spinner sets and having to pay $10 for a minifigure and a spinner that I am not likely to use.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The pack is a plastic bag that can be ripped open, not quite a polybag and more like the bags that the Collectible Minifigure line comes in. There is a set of instructions... more like a listing of what weapons and other figures are in the series.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You've got 28 pieces, most of which are the new weapon pieces and some pieces for use with the spinners. For me, the big draw is the new kendo helmet and Cole's weapons. Especially for the new sais and some pearl gold pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You've got just one minifigure, that of Cole in a Kendo outfit/armor.&nbsp;</p><p>The minifigure is almost like a souped up version of the Collectible Minifigures, only you know which one you'll be getting specifically and having far more pieces than standard.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4>I think LEGO might do well to have more of these figures come in the booster packs and not waste resources for multiple spinners. Sure, have the spinners in the Starter Set. But after that, I don't think they need to keep making more of these.<br><br>I have been in the toy aisle looking at other sets to pick up and over hearing and helping other parents with picking out Ninjago for their child. Many of them have expressed a distaste to the high price of the sets for a single figure and spinner. They'd rather get their child a set that will have more figures or more pieces and offer the more conventional LEGO build.<br><br>I would go for more of these booster packs to get a specific figure and all the accessories with it versus the cost of a larger set that I don't like or paying sky rocket prices over on Amazon/E-Bay/Brick Link, ects from resellers selling the individual figure.<br>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,4
"alva","2012-02-28T06:37:43.937Z","Another way to get Ninjago Minifigs","I love the Ninjago minifigs. I think they are really cool. But I really do not like the sets that they come with. I think mixing modern technology such as motorcycle, jet plane, etc with some old fashioned ninja is really strange. So, I really avoid buying Ninjago sets that come with modern technology.<br><br>Found it in a store a couple days ago and just opened it last night, and this set come with a lot of weapons : 3 chains, 1 pearl gold bar, 1 reddish brown bar, 2 silver sais, 1 pearl gold chainsaw blade, and 2 black lightsaber hilts. Really a lot for one minifig. Cole even can not hold them with his two hands:)<br><br>Another great thing about this set is there's some cards included. Until now, I still don't know what to do with the cards, but the artwork in the cards really look cool.<br><br>There's two points that I don't like from the set :<br>1. The armor with it's dark grey color is really plain and looks dirty. I think it will be really great if there's some printing on the armor. Or probably using lighter or pearl color?<br>2. The weapon parts that include in this set can not be combined to create some cool weapons. <br><br>So for recap, if you want to get Kendo Cole minifig without buying any set or you want some weapons part that included in this set then this set is really for you. But, do not expect the minifig will be as cool and as detailed as regular Ninjago minifig.<br><br>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,1
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-16T05:11:47.8Z","LEGO Ninjago - Kendo Cole Review","<p>This is a very useful set to have and it's a nice addition into any LEGO collection for sure.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 28 pieces and it is 5 USD. That means that the price per piece ratio is 18 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for a set like this.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks very nice. The printings on the torso are the same as in the very first LEGO Ninjago waves. We also get a very nice armor 
piece with this set and a very useful helmet piece.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/9551-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has some very useful accessories with this set. We get 3chains&nbsp; which you can put underneath the spinner and we also get a nice 
looking staff, a chain saw staff, two rocks for your spinner, a cylinder piece 
which has some grooves in it and a double-sided dagger. We also get some very nice looking cards with this set.</span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
