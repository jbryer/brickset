First off, to those of you who hate having multiple spinners and just want everything else, look no further. This set includes everything except a spinner. I just used Garmadon's spinner to try it out. Overall, it's an okay set. The build isn't much, if you are an AFOL then&nbsp;don't&nbsp;expect an epic build like the Collector's Edition&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon. The pieces are pretty good, like new green reeds, a gold snake, Lloyd's&nbsp;rib-cage&nbsp;shirt with the number of his favorite Lego&nbsp;soccer&nbsp;team, etc. The set isn't very playable, so there is nothing you can do unless you get another spinner (Try Garmadon's spinner for looks, or if you want to use everything in the bag, get a serpentine spinner). Considering how much the spinner sets before were, I give this the votes for ""Good value for money.""<div><br></div><div>Overall, good set, just don't expect too much. Don't be like the four ninja who find that they are supposed to fight him when expecting Lord Garmadon. This isn't the dude who stole the Gold Weapons of Spinjitzu. This is&nbsp;just&nbsp;a small set for those who want to make their spinners better or who want to just play around with the parts.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,5
"Squidtron","2012-01-08T16:56:49.837Z","Nice bonus for the parts.","<p>I received this set for Christmas, and it was great! I gotta say, there's no play value to this set whatsoever. The game you can play with the spinners is rather boring, and I don't have any of them anyway. I've played it a little with one of my friends, but really, get this set for the parts, not the cards. So what are the parts that make this set worth it? First of all, the minigure looks great. The face is very useful, because it is a good expression, and is not double-sided. The torso is neat looking, but not that useful. It looks similar to Garmadon's torso, but it has a green 5 printed on it. Looks good, but not helpful in MOCing. He comes with a hood, again, a very useful part, especially in castle building. The cloak is a shorter version of the ordinary black cloak. This too is a useful part, not only in castle building though, its nice for making an assassin in sci-fi or whatever else you might use assassins in. The legs are the standard, unbendable, short legs. Useful for making children or dwarfs, but not much else. The other accessories are good all round, even in Bionicle MOCing. The green tentacles are good for making aliens or alien landscapes, they can also pass as vines, if your in to that kind of building. The staffs are great, the stick part of each is only useful for making more staffs, but hey, we all like staffs, right? The connector at the top is a brilliant piece in all themes, it makes a great greeble for Space or Bionicle, perfect for making weapons in castle, tools in city, the list goes on. The golden snake is the best part on this set. It looks very cool, and can be held by a minigure like a weapon, or be connected to a baseplate via the connector on its underside. As a weapon, it's kinda clumsy and awkward looking, but still, it is fun. When used as a snake, it looks awesome. I can't think of how one might use it, but its a fun piece to have all the same. I might buy the set for it alone. The red parts included are nifty little things, but, like all red pieces, they're only useful in building red things. And even for that, they're not great, but the don't detract from the set in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>A side note to those who play the game (I'm just speculating here, 'cause I've never actually played with it): This set is very powerful, just from the minifigure and weapons. Because Lloyd has the short legs, which do not bend like normal minifig legs, cards like ""Limbo"" and ""Shaky Bones"" do not work on him. Unfortunately, you cannot use ""Meditate"" either, but he comes with his own version: ""Fearless"" His weapons are large, long, and thus have a long range.</p><p><br></p><p>In one sentence: Whether you like the game or the pieces, this is a great set!<br></p><p> </p>",TRUE,4,5,1,1,3

<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.</p>

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2012-02-15T16:01:47.347Z","Lloyd Garmadon Review","<p>I'm not completely going out on a limb here, whereas of this review, I have seen one Ninjago episode. I'm clearly not the intended target audience and age for the series, but as an adult, I love the idea of all these Ninja characters and the Serpentine and want to collect them up. I however, don't want many of the sets they come in and the $10 price tag on the Spinner sets seems way too much. Especially if all you want is just the minifigure. And these Booster Packs provide just that at $5.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As this set is really more of a Booster Pack, you have a bag that the minifigure comes in that's more like the packaging of the Collectible Minifigures then a flimsy polybag. The bag is more durable than either and prevents tampering with in the store and thus, the less likelihood of getting shoplifted.</p><p>You have something of a set of instructions in the way of a folded sheet of paper showing how any weapon assembly and placing of bricks on a spinner should be done. And some advertisement for other Ninjago sets.<br></p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>In all there's a total of 21 pieces, many of which are either used for weapons or placing on a spinner. Personally I was interested for potential MOCs and weapon pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The feature of this Booster Pack is Lloyd Garmadon, who after seeing the one episode that I did, will be more of a potential hero as he tries to right his wrong of unleashing all of those Serpentine. He is very well done with the print job.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>There really isn't much of a build, other than that this is a booster pack. For those who play the Spinner Game, you've got power cards for Lloyd and pieces for using him in battle. I have to say I appreciate the lack of a Spinner as it's not really needed to include with every figure if the person wanting to play the game gets the Basic Spinner Set. You don't need to have a bunch of useless spinners laying around when all that's need are one or two for play.</p>And for those looking for something of a ""souped up"" Collectible Minifigure, this is a good pack to grab up as you know exactly which figure you're getting and don't have to play a guessing game with a blind pack, hoping you get the one you want.",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"Aidypie","2012-01-11T13:35:39.82Z","Sensei Wu has more family trouble...","This set is a great set if you are a Ninjago fan like me. Though I love the Spinners, I think the price is extortion. $10.00 for a tiny SPINNER??? ...That was what I thought when I first saw a Spinner at a Ninjago teaser at Toysrus. I'm not saying that as soon as I walked into Target and found out that they had the Spinners, I didn't buy the Starter Set right away. I'm just saying that considering that you can get TWO Minifigs, a launcher, and a golden weapon for $7.99, getting one Minifig, a spinner, three weapons, and four cards for $9.99, well, it just seems like a bad deal to me.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>But, Hallelujah, the booster packs are here. They come with cards, a Minifig, and weapons. There's only one problem, which is that if you don't have a ""Rise of the Snakes"" Spinner, then you can't play the game. This is because this set comes with a few pieces (the shark fins) that you can't use with the old Spinners. I know I said one problem, but hey, there are two. Lloyd is not tall enough to spin. Yes, that's right, the entire point of the set, down the tube. He fits on, but he looks as though he is wading through the spinner. I don't know if this changes with the&nbsp;</span>""Rise of the Snakes""<span class=""Apple-style-span"">&nbsp;Spinners, but it doesn't work with the old ones.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Now, I don't know if this is a typo, or if it's some preliminary image thing (I know Huw added the pictures for the new Ninjago sets before Lego.com did,) or what, but in the Brickset picture it shows an orange piece that isn't on Lego.com. Either way, it did not come in the set. This</span>&nbsp;was a little annoying.&nbsp;I imagine that this piece would go between Lloyd and the spinner, and that it would make up for the fact that he doesn't come with any blades or chains to go on the bottom.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Over all, this is a good set. I love it how Lloyd is wearing a sweater with his position on the soccer team, and that he has painted ribs on to look like Lord Garmadon's. Another thing I like about this set&nbsp;(in a weird little way)&nbsp;is how ridiculous he looks with his weapons. The golden snake is a nice piece, and it goes well with him. The two staffs, though, look ridiculous with him. The one with the vines in particular looks funny. This is because it is more than two times the size of Lloyd himself.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is a good set, and I would recommend it, will recommend it, and am recommending it to a friend.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-11-25T11:07:59.363Z","Garmadon's Son","<p>Set #9552 Lloyd Garmadon: Well the site just ate my first review and rather than waste my time trying to type up the entire thing again from memory due to the fact that I hate typing up the same thing twice. I shall simply give the cliff notes version instead.</p>
<p>Lloyd Garmadon, great Mini-Fig, interesting and clever torso print, invoking his father's torso armor and green number five is a great nod to what LEGO had planned for the character in the mythos. Weapons are designed for evasion rather than actual fighting, Blinding Staff, Spear of Forked Tongues and a rare Gold Viper.</p>
<p>Pieces to enhance the Spinner, not the best, rather mediocre in my opinion. Cards included with set: Lloyd Garmadon Character Card, Fearless. White Out, Crown of Lightning, Whip Attack.</p>
<p>Overall, not the best Booster Pack as far as price-per-piece, a good one to track down if you can't afford the Rattlecopter which also includes Lloyd's Mini-Fig. Not much of a Spinner enahancer either, yet it's still got potential.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
