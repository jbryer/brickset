"ELDASPOXD666","2020-05-08T20:00:06.703Z","Not the best LEGO set, but surely one of the most fun sets to play with","<p>Today, I decided to write a review about another good set I had as a kid: Kai ZX&#39;s spinner!</p>

<h2>Backstory:</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been a Ninjago fan since the show&#39;s pilot episode first aired in 2011, with Kai being my favorite character. And I specially liked the ZX suits that were introduced for Season 1, which is why I got this spinner pack specifically. I&#39;m a big fan of the spinner battle gimmick introduced with these packs, but I never got to fully experience it because none of my friends had spinners (though I sometimes placed a bunch of minifigures on the floor and tried to knock them out with my spinner).</p>

<h2>Build:</h2>

<p>Because this is a spinner pack, this set has a very low piece count (it only has 27 pieces), therefore, it doesn&#39;t have any significant builds, with the spinner and a spear being the only things you can actually build (aside from the minifigure). And even though they&#39;re not builds, this set also comes with the Sword of Fire, a bo staff, and 5 cards that are used for spinner battles. Even though this set doesn&#39;t strive for show accuracy (just like every other spinner pack), it portrays the show&#39;s Spinjitzu tornadoes in a somewhat accurate way.</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>The minifigure selection is nothing special, as this set only includes Kai ZX, and even though he&#39;s one of the most common minifigures from the Rise of the Snakes wave, this set is the cheapest way to get him.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>I think the $10 price for this set is perfect considering the piece count. That&#39;s it, there&#39;s nothing else to say about the price.</p>

<h2>Extra:</h2>

<p>For the extra section, I want to talk about the spinner battle gimmick. Personally, I like it, and I think it&#39;s one of the most original gimmicks LEGO has ever made (even though it&#39;s been used many times throughout the Ninjago sets). The only issue I have with it is the fact that you need a friend with a spinner to actually play spinner battles (and like I said previously, none of my friends had spinners, so I couldn&#39;t do that).</p>

<h2>Overall opinion:</h2>

<p>Overall, I think it&#39;s a decent set, and I&#39;d recommend it to people who want to play spinner battles with their friends, or to people who want a cheap way to get Kai ZX with the Sword of Fire. Though, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to people who want Spinjitzu tornadoes that are accurate to the show (if you want that, you should either buy the Legacy spinners, or the Season 11 spinners).</p>
