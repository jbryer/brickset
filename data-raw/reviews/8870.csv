Visualy this set does not disopoint and the minifigures are&nbsp;equaly amazing. Now, I dont&nbsp;know the story line this time so bear with me.&nbsp;But enougth chit-chat I say! To the review!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Minifigures.</p><p>Kai Zx: Well, Kai has been redsigned he has dark red arms and chest printing that continues on his back, on the front you can see a chest plate and some ninja stars.He also has one of the new ninja masks which dosent have the back part.It looks pretty nice. And the jetpack,it is made the new alien guns with the new bucket piece used as thrusters with the clever use of snow shoes as wings.Over all it actuly looks realy cool.He is equipped with golden blades.</p><p>Fang-Sui:This is one of the new snake man, he has realy cool printing on the front and back which looks like scales and a tooth nekalece.The new head is very cool.&nbsp;I will admit that when I first saw pictures of him I thought he looked a little lame, but I was wrong! He is quite cool.</p><p>Lloyd Garmadon: O.K from the looks of this guy I'd say he's a braty kid trying to look like his dad, speculations aside he is intersting,he has one of the new smaller capes an a newhead.Also he caries a lightning sword simaler to Garmadon.It looks like he painted the ribs on his shirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Rattlecopter: Now the best part, all start at the front. This is a very nicely detailed cockpit it shows some real thought put into the design process.It looks exectly&nbsp;like a snake, from the red eyes to the fangs and the all green color scheme.Moving to the side we have some jet thrusters with stibilizing fins&nbsp;and venom missiles which are flick-fire. Just behind those are two flaps which if pressed drop a white snake charge,&nbsp;this actuly&nbsp;works&nbsp;very well. Lastly we have the tail, which looks suspicly like a snake tail, has a jet turbine at the end,which is made with the new spinner crowns which go on top of the spinner.The rotor also uses the new large blade piece's and it may be hard to get them to spin without wobbling but&nbsp;it takes some fine tuning.In the cockpit there is sticker computer screen. Right above the cockpit is the snake army symbol.Over all it cuts a evil eperence when looked at stright on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So over all I think this set is well designed and has realy good playability and good value for your money.This set would go good with Jay's storm fighter, then you could have a dog fight,the minifig are good and so is the design.I well probly get more ninjago vehicles in the futrue.&nbsp;So go get it before its gone!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"dragon_teenager","2012-01-18T13:55:09.397Z","A slight disappointment ","I received this set for Christmas, and although I have never been a very big fan of Ninjago, this set always appealed to me due to the unique design and interesting angular construction. As a result, my expectations were pretty high for this set, but I was unfortunately a little disappointed. <br><br>The first thing out of the box is the minifigs, spearheaded by a red ninja with a jetpack (I do not know the names of the Ninjago characters). This is actually my favorite part of the set. The jetpack design is unique and very cool, and makes use of some great parts. The ninja minifigure itself is equally impressive, with some great printing and a generally very intimidating look. And, two great weapons to boot! <br><br>The other figs are a little less impressive, but still not too bad. One appears to be Darth Sidious Jr. (I believe his real name is Lloyd) including a lightning staff of sorts and unique body print. I haven't been following the Ninjago storyline so I have no idea what the significance here is, but I can tell you that the minifig is generally unremarkable, save the useful lightning bolt piece. <br><br>Last but not least is the snake pilot of the Rattlecopter. Like the other minifigs, the snake includes a fantastic staff and some interesting prints, but I'm not completely sold on the new head piece. The piece is a new mold, and works well enough, but I just don't find it as aesthetically pleasing as the red ninja's new mask piece. This is probably just my preference, so you might disagree. Overall, the fig isn't too bad. <br><br>After you finish building the minifigures, you'll move right on to the Rattlecopter. The build is a little frustrating due to the high abundance of jointed parts needed, due to the many unusual angles of the set. However, this is offset slightly by the satisfaction of seeing the unique construction come together. I will say that the design of the model is quite unique, and the construction methods used by the designers are quite clever.<br><br>However, I am left wishing for a little more. My biggest problem with the set is the overabundance of loosely attached parts. There is a compartment in the midsection that is supposed to snap open and drop snake ""bombs"" on unfortunate targets; however, the snake projectiles tend to fall out on their own. The back end of the Rattlecopter (the ""tail"") is supposed to curl back towards the front, rather like a snake tail would. However, it is not firmly attached into place. The designers chose to use a friction joint and a pin to attach the tail section, meaning that will often uncurl and flop around during play. <br><br>The Rattlecopter also has two ""fangs"" attached to the bottom of the cockpit, but unfortunately these are attached by frictionless pieces and just dangle below the vehicle. I find this very annoying, especially during play. The two ""wing"" flaps attached to either side of the chopper, as you can probably tell by the box art, are also attached with an articulation piece. <br><br>Another problem I have with the set is it's slightly incomplete appearance. Although it looks quite menacing from the front, a top-down angle makes it look like it's missing a few bricks. Individually, these issues might not seem like too big of a deal, but they stack up to make the Rattlecopter feel like it needed a few rebuilds. True, a lot of these problems could be solved through mods, but given the $30 asking price for this model, I am of the opinion that it should be a satisfying build right out of the box. <br><br>By now you might be wondering, if I disliked so much about the set, why did I give it 3/5 stars? Well, the truth is, despite these shortcomings I have to admire the general aesthetics of the set. The cockpit looks very cool and employs a lot of unique construction methods to great effect. The minifigs are good to great, and a lot of useful new molds are included. This set makes an excellent parts pack.<br><br>The bottom line: Should you buy it? I would say yes, but only if you're really into NinjaGo. If you're focused on other themes, like me, you could probably get more value from your $30 elsewhere. NinjaGo fans, however, will probably appreciate the charmingly offbeat vibe of the Rattlecopter. <br><br>3/5 stars = a decent set that some people will probably enjoy more than others. <br>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3
"legoDad42","2012-01-19T00:24:27.423Z","Snakes on a Copter!","<p>The <strong>Rattlecopter</strong> is an EXCELLENT model from the<strong> NinjaGo</strong> line. Great design, interesting build techniques and a sturdy model to boot.</p>
<h4>At 327 + pieces for $39.99 (paid $33.00 at a TRU BOGO sale) the 'copter measures about 11+ inches&nbsp;in length, roughly 5"" in height, 6"" wide at the engines (about 9"" with the wing attachments)&nbsp;and comes with&nbsp;flick-fire missiles, double venomous snake bombs, NEW Fang-Suei, little Lloyd Garmadon and Kai-ZX mini-figs.</h4>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall great design...looks good at any angle. Nice tilt of the cockpit gives it an 'attack helicopter' look.

<li>
<li>Unique bomb-bay which can drop 2 white&nbsp;venomous mini-snakes called Sly Vipers. Note: Here on top is where you place the snakes and then squeeze either side of the panel to drop&nbsp;them out of the bottom of copter. Fun play feature and clever little mechanism.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rear-rotor 4 headed snake element (both sides of copter)&nbsp;can be taken off and attached to any spinner to provide more balance. Note: Rear-rotor spins effectively. 
<li>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7149/6722598269_0722a28a0d.jpg[/img] 
<li>
<li>Large, detailed sword elements used as main rotor-blades. Excellent looking and spins very well. 
<li>Some interesting and clever build techniques (especially the 'snake-bomb drop'). 
<li>A sturdy model for play. Very swooshable!</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MINIFIGURES...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>- New<strong><em> LLOYD GARMADON</em></strong> fig. (son of Lord Garmadon) comes with hood, cape and nice pearl gold handled lightning weapon (<strong>Lightning Bolt Dagger</strong>). Plus pearl gold Venomari Staff (<strong>Golden Constrictai Staff</strong> belonging to Constrictai General Skalidor and contains a vile of anti-venom which lets you breathe again if you have been squished by a Constrictai). 
<li>- Hot headed Ninja of Fire,<strong>KAI-ZX</strong> with twin, pearl-gold bladed weapons (<strong>Golden Points</strong>) and detailed jet pack. 
<li>-ALL NEW <strong>FANG-SUEI</strong> Fangpyre Soldier. His bite can transform anyone into a snake. Nice front and back printing and excellent all new head sculpt. His white venomous snakes (<strong>Sly Vipers</strong>) are the ones used for the bomb drop feature.

<li></li></ul>
<p><strong>CON'S...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minor...some of the stickers aren't necessary for the look. Although the vent, Fangpyre symbol and the cockpit stickers I feel are necessary. 
<li>No spinners. I wish they'd supply them since it makes you go and get the single character packs to acquire them. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>I <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</strong> picking up this kit. Sleek, well designed vehicle...nice build techniques and good minifigures. Plus excellent parts! <strong><em>5 Bricks Up</em>!</strong></p>

  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Set LEGO Ninjago 9443 Rattlecopter refers to the episode of Ninjago: the escape of the son of Lord Garmadon, Lloyd with the Gold Scepter Constrictor, during the escape Lloyd is blocked by&nbsp; Fang-Suei&nbsp; with Rattlecopter and mini-snakes, to the rescue of Lloyd comes Kai with his jet pack .</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Set 9443 is sold in a box of medium in size and consists of:</span></p>

  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">&bull;Rattlecopter<br />
  &bull;three minifigs: Kai, Lloyd Garmadon, Fang-Suei<br />
  &bull;a Scepter Costrictor<br />
  &bull;two white mini-snakes</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">It is a set oriented to an audience of at least eight years old, but in this case I think we can safely say that even children with a year younger and with a bit of experience in LEGO bricks could be able to assemble and play with it.</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Inside the box we find the instruction booklet, and three envelopes that containing the brick.<br />
  Following the scheme proposed by LEGO in the instruction book, it begins starting from the first envelope of brick, assembling the minifig of Lloyd Garmadon with the Scepter, Fang-Suei , and then pass to the realization of&nbsp; Kay with his jet-pack.</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">At this point begins the assembly of real Rattlecopter starting from the central body that contains in the two side, a compartments which house/hide the mini snakes, and continue with the tail and the mechanism of rotation of the propeller hub and rear; for the whole realization it is needed the opening of the second envelope of the brick. It should be noted that also in this set, as is now traditional for&nbsp; Ninjago set, is widely used pieces of LEGO Tecnic to implement those captivating lines and never dull.<br />
  It then goes on to complete the central body, accomplishing the two mechanisms for the launch of the missiles (two per side) that are hinged to the body of the helicopter in a way that can be positioned in different ways, and the two lateral jet engines that act as basis also for the anchorage of the hinges of the green side wings.</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">It now remains to make the cockpit and the central mechanism of rotation for the airscrew requiring the opening of the third brick envelope.<br />
  You start making the base of the cockpit that houses the pilot and the instrument panel which is objectively a bit thin, and continue with what I think is the over challenging of the set: the realization&nbsp; of the snake helicopter muzzle.<br />
  Note that the front of the helicopter is realized in a unique part as a result by means of inclined pinstecnic and is fastened to the body of the helicopter granting him a front inclined with respect to the body.</span></p>
 <p>
  <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Completed the front part is passed to the realization of the opening system for the upper part of the cockpit and of the mechanism of rotation of the central propeller, both achieved without major problems and that these complete the assembly of the Rattlecopter .</span></p>

However, the build was enjoyable and took slightly less than a half hour. The function was TERRIBLE, the thing itself kept breaking, and many parts kept falling off when I made an action scene. Also Kai's jetpack keeps breaking. I think all snake vehicles always break like this. (Because my friend has the Wrecking ball and it also breaks)<br/><br/>Also on ground it breaks, and, for that very reason, it has to be an airplane instead of helicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I met&nbsp;a friend who has this set (sadly, none do) before purchase. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: :(</p>",TRUE,3,5,5,1,4
"SmythTheCrow","2014-05-12T14:49:24.997Z","Great Helicopter","<p>I got this set 2 years ago (at the time this review was made)&nbsp;and it was a great set. Even the minifigures are great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>-New Pieces</p>

<p>-Use of Technic Pieces</p>

<p>-Snake Design</p>

<p>-Playability</p>

<p>-Kai&#39;s Jet pack</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>-No Spinners</p>

<p>-Wrong Staff</p>

<p>-Lloyd&#39;s stubby legs</p>

<p>-No base (just like in the show)</p>

<p>That is all for this review. If you want to see the video review, I&#39;ll be working on it.</p>

<p>Anyway, goodbye guys. Hope y&#39;all have a good day and I&#39;ll see you later. Bye bye&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building this set was a good experience. the technic stuff wasn&#39;t all that fun but that&#39;s just personal preference. you may love technic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figures - Lloyd garmadon is a great figure, however he does come in one of those 5 dollar booster packs. Fang sue too is a good figure, but he does come in a spinner too. ZX Kai is a good figure, but kai now has a jetpack! that&#39;s interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play value - i think the snake bomb function is fun, and the inclusion of a jetpack for kai adds so much more play value as he can also fly&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks - The rattlecopter looks pretty good once finished i think. i like the fangpyre head on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value - PPP Here is good, and there&#39;s some good fun to be had with this set.</p>
