"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T18:56:33.107Z","What an Amazing Value for Such a Small Set!","<p><strong>9440 Venomari Shrine&nbsp;</strong>is the smallest boxed set from the 2012 &quot;Rise of the Snakes&quot;&nbsp;Ninjago sets, the first wave of sets that featured the Serpentine antagonists. Although this set itself does not include any Serpentine minifigures, it does include two smaller snakes. Don&#39;t think that either of these factors hurts this set, though! In fact, I would personally argue that it does quite the opposite of expectations: it is among the best sets under $10, and even manages to compete with slightly larger sets- after all, you can buy two of these for the price of one larger set, and get even more spectacular and versatile parts!&nbsp;This set is an amazing value for such a small price!</p>

<p>Aside from including a good variety of colors and pieces that can be used in multiple situations (unlike some of the brightly-colored pieces&nbsp;in the larger sets), this set&nbsp;includes many new parts as well. If you want to build something a little bigger (e.g. A snake palace), you can easily do so with two (or even one, if you&#39;re willing to limit your imagination a bit) of these sets. One particular piece that stands out in this set is the 1x2 profile brick that looks like an&nbsp;<em>actual</em>&nbsp;brick. Only getting one or two of these would be incredible, but, no, you get a grand total of six! How can you say no to that?</p>

<p>Even though this set simply looks good, that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t any play features. On each side, there are platforms that can be used to launch the included snakes up in the air; although this feature isn&#39;t the greatest of all the Ninjago sets, it&#39;s a nice inclusion, and adds a little to the playability.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Venomari Snake Staff.</li>
	<li>New Snake mold pieces.</li>
	<li>Launching feature.</li>
	<li>LEGO bricks that look like real bricks (always handy to have); 6 total included in this set.</li>
	<li>Amazing detail for 86 pieces.</li>
	<li>&quot;Snake head&quot; on&nbsp;shrine has printing on it;&nbsp;no&nbsp;stickers!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Only one sword for Zane.</li>
	<li>No Serpentine&nbsp;minifigure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from a few minor details, this set is quite a bargain and, if you are interested in buying this, you should not hesitate to do so. Overall, this set can be enjoyed by all ages as both a playset and a little display piece. If you happen to buy more than one, you can use the parts for even greater things... or maybe just build an even&nbsp;awesomer shrine...?</p>

"AETerry","2011-12-19T01:40:02.617Z","Venomari Shrine Review","While I'm not a huge fan of Ninjago, the new snakes theme and Snakemen of 2012 have caught my attention. This particular set doesn't have any of the new snakemen, but it does have Zane and several other good little pieces like the new cobra snakes.<br><br>I'd say at $6.99 and with 86 pieces, the price is well worth it. Especially with all the new pieces found in this set. There are 1x2 bricks with ridging on them that make for great adobe style look and feel. The new snake pieces themselves, the gold staff and Zane himself.<br><br>Zane comes with a gold shoulder pad piece that he can hold up to two katanas in back. His hood is different from the older ninja hoods with a clip on the back for holding a sword. Looks wise he is great.<br><br>The Shrine Build is a solid set and looks great with the snake feel and venomous neon green elements on it. I'm still not a fan of the flick style weapons and deals. There's two ""flips"" that can be hit down to launch the snakes into the air at Zane. I'm sure younger kids will find great appeal in that aspect. For me as an adult, it's a gimmick that doesn't work or appeal.<br><br>All in all it's a great set and well worth it to Ninjago collectors and fans or those looking parts and pieces for MOCing purposes.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p><strong>1. Zane ZX:</strong> The only minifigure in this set. His upgraded suit, armor, and headwrap are far better than the original Zane. He comes with a silver katana. It would've been nice if he came with two katanas.</p>

<p><strong>The Shrine:</strong> Beautiful and awesome all rolled into one. The dripping venom is a nice touch, especially since they make it look like the venom is coming from the snake head carving. </p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> The two Venomari vipers can flung by pressing down on the two black levers. They can actually go quite far.</p>

It's good way to start out your 'Rise of the Snakes' collection, because of it's size and price.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; The price of $6.99 is great, considering the fact that some minifigures sell for the same price. 8 cents per piece is not bad at all.</p><p>Let's look at the details -</p>

Easy for toddlers to understand.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>&nbsp; The parts are good for a set this small, actually. It comes with some of the new Masonry-Profile Bricks, which are really great new pieces. Two lime-colored vipers are included, along with a piece with a viper printed on stone.</div><div><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline"">&nbsp; There are many transparent pieces in the set as well. Finally, the Venomari staff is exclusive to this set, which is another reason to buy it.
</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp; Zane ZX - The only minifig in the set. He is mainly white, with some clothing and weapon detail. He is wearing a gold&nbsp;shoulder pad&nbsp;piece, and also a has an star-shaped accent on his wrap in the same gold. He has a yellow, straight face, not double-sided.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp; The build is simple, takes about 5-10 minutes. The only part that could spell a bit of trouble for toddlers is the black launchers, which sometimes don't go down exactly the way you want.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp; The completed model is fun to have, and has some good detail. The launcher is fun also, if you really slam it, you can send those vipers into Ninjago Series 3!</p>

<p>The instructions were fairly easy to follow. I&#39;m missing two 1x1 black bricks, but the structure holds just as it would with them. I intend to order them later on, mostly to ease the OCD it gives me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a sucker for any Ninjago set that has Zane in it, so it was an almost instant buy for me. This would be the first time I&#39;ve ever ordered something preowned without a box. But the seller was very nice and it arrived into the mail early, so I didnt feel very anxious. Zane&#39;s paint job on his figure looks just like it would in the series, and I was very happy about that. I&#39;m still a bit impartial about him having a sword instead of the famed Shurikens.</p>

<p>The dripping venom pieces took a bit of time for me to ignore, since I got a bit paranoid that a neon green clear stud was missing, until I realized it was supposed to be uneven.</p>

<p>The snakes pop up like they&#39;re supposed to. I almost lost one when I was testing it out, so I wouldn&#39;t play with the set on a surface that&#39;s&nbsp;hard to move from against a wall.</p>

<p>I honestly kind of wish that it came with a Serpentine general of some kind, mostly to make the staff&#39;s presence more fitting and make more of a nod towards Season 1. But all in all, I enjoy playing with this set most when I combine it with my other sets to add to my massive personal Lego world.</p>
