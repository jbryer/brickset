"meyerc13","2011-12-18T15:24:31.59Z","Buy it for the Model or for the Parts","<p>This is one of the new 2012 Ninjago sets, and it's a great set for the excellent selection of parts, as well as a great model once put together.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is okay, but honestly when I've seen it on the shelf it never drew my attention to how awesome this set really is.&nbsp; The instructions suffer from the common problem of coming folded in the box.&nbsp; While building the set, 3-4 times the instructions rolled off my table.&nbsp; At least the sticker sheet wasn't creased/rolled.<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are where this set really shines.&nbsp; First, it has lots of new 2011/2012 parts, like the 4x1 double slope, the 'Stafford slope,' the 1x2 brick with a masonry pattern, and the 1x1 round tile (in several colors as well as printed).&nbsp; It also has two giant sword like pieces that I haven't seen before and I think are new.&nbsp; The set also has lots of plates and tiles in various sizes and colors, as well as plates with clips and 12 blue hinge plates.&nbsp; If that isn't enough, there are also some useful bricks - such as slopes and inverted slopes.&nbsp; For the parts alone, this set is well worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The set comes with two minifgs.&nbsp; First up is Jay ZX.&nbsp; The printing on this minifig seems a bit more high-tech than the older waves of Ninjago, which seems to fit with the jet included in this set.&nbsp; The set also includes Snappa, whose printing is reminiscent of a shaman of some type.&nbsp; This is an interesting switch from last year's Ninjago, where the skeletons had the technology and the Ninjas were more traditional.&nbsp; It makes me wonder why the Ninjas switched from dragons to jets... maybe the snakes turned the dragons against them?<h4>The build</h4>There are some things I liked about the build and some things I didn't.&nbsp; Due to the symmetrical nature of the model, some parts of the build are repetitive.&nbsp; However, the mechanism to extend the wings is interesting and it is fun to watch the model come together.&nbsp; There are a few stickers, and unfortunately they all seem to be on pieces that are hard to place stickers on.<br><h4>The completed model</h4>The model seems fairly solid, although there are two headlight bricks in
 the cockpit that aren't 'trapped' so they tend to fall off fairly 
easily.&nbsp; Once completed, this jet is a lot of fun to play with.&nbsp; By pushing the engine forward, the wings unlock and snap open.&nbsp; Lots of fun to swoosh around. <h4>Summary</h4>Overall, if you are a fan of Ninjago this is a great set because it's a lot of fun to pay with.&nbsp; If you aren't a Ninjago fan, you should still consider this set for the great selection of parts.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"BTZ4435","2012-01-16T10:31:12.887Z","Nice","<p>Well, this set is pretty good. This was my first&nbsp;Ninjago set of 2012. It has a good ppp ratio.(Price per piece.) </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The box is very good for traveling the whole set. Even with the extra fin things fit perfictally. The instructions are the average instruction size. The only thing is that in the middle of the instructions, it showed all the weapons and sets they come in. I liked that but I only wish that the information came at the end of the instructions like most information like that does</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The parts in this set are flat out amazing. All the minifigures come with printed legs and torsos which are always good. There is a no stud stud element, and new weapons. My favorite element was the cement brick looking brick or the snake hypnostaff. The snake hypno staff would be good with out the non studed stud for the Pharoah's Quest snake. It would look cooler on that but anyways, it is still cool.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp; The minifigures aren't that good. They kind of stink. You get a Jay ZX without a shoulderpad piece. And, you get Snappa looking cleaver thing. I was hoping for a little walker/speeder for Snappa.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The build is very simple.&nbsp; You get a lot of hinges to make the jet have opening swords underneath the wings. Otherwise, it wasn't that fun to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp;It is very solid. The sword function works pretty well. The jet has so many details, considering the fact it only had three stickers. The shrine is so cool! It's fairly big and has a brick wall element. So, this was a huge success.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>&nbsp; This set is&nbsp;worth your money to buy.&nbsp;Only buy it for the parts or the jet.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,4

"Matroxide","2012-08-09T17:20:20.497Z","Great for Christmas ","I realy can not think of any better ways to get Jay ZX and get an awsome set, unless of course you buy the Great Devouerer set. One of the only cons is that it did not come with a blue snake like pictured above, but not like it would realy help the playability. Jay is my favorite of the four (now five) ninjas and&nbsp;I wish he had come with his shoulder pads. Snappa was included but&nbsp;I wish someone else who looked better could have been in his place. Dispite all that, it is a realy cool set. The Jet's&nbsp;converting feature is realy cool and the function is cleaver! It is worth it's money, although there are those nagging cons that would have made the set worth more than the price!",FALSE,5,5,5,4,5
"Joefish","2018-01-24T12:00:48.173Z","Mistakes by LEGO product engineering spoil an otherwise great set.","<p>Nice enough jet fighter design, with a clever array of spring-out gold swords - at least in theory.</p>

<p>The problem is that between the time the set was designed, and the time it was put into manufacture (according to LEGO&#39;s designers at the time), another department at LEGO changed the design of the 1x4 plate hinges, making them stiffer in operation. This meant that the elastic band provided in this set was no longer strong enough to make the array of gold swords (tucked in under the wings) deploy properly when the switch on top is activated. Adding another elastic band for extra strength just makes the mechanism break apart.</p>

<p>A fact which spoils much enjoyment of the set and devalues it considerably.</p>

<p>With the parts swapped out for older versions, the sword deployment works brilliantly and is a fun feature to play with. With the parts that came in the set and ever since, it&#39;s unfortunately a bit of a damp squib.</p>

"Norikins","2018-01-22T21:09:28.37Z","One of the poorest ROTS sets","<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Really common, Jay ZX and Snappa. Jay ZX, ironically in a set all about him, comes unarmed and with no shoulder armor, which he has in just about every other set. I suppose you could detach the gold blades on the sides of the cockpit to give him weapons, but the Nunchucks of Lightning would have been more appropriate considering they turn into the jet. Snappa&nbsp;comes in cheaper sets, even in a book.</p>

<p>Building:</p>

<p>You have to begin the jet by making all these segments the blades come out of in the back, which are unstable until&nbsp;you lock them together much later. Absolutely no&nbsp;SNOT are used.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>None of the parts are really rare but the wings (which come in arguably cooler Earth Blue in many sets), and all detail is provided through&nbsp;stickers except the Fangpyre staff and minifigs. The fins on the back have only 1 side stickered, and no matter how you place the jet the unstickered side shows.</p>

<p>Staff Shrine:</p>

<p>Not bad. The brick and plant pieces are useful for making ruins and the Fangpyre&nbsp;Staff is included. There is a strange gap in it, however, with grille tiles (real tiles would be better) representing venom, presumably, but unlike in the Venomari&nbsp;Shrine set, it is literally covered and poorly placed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jet:</p>

<p>Looks okay, but it&#39;s had to hold without accidentally triggering the mechanism. The mechanism is very cool, opening up the wings into a sunrise pattern with the blades, BUT, it wears out the rubber band in 24 hours, even if you don&#39;t use it&nbsp;and needs to be replaced. An adequately strong rubber band stresses the technic pieces anchoring it, and in a short time too a replacement band will fail. You will have to keep replacing the rubber band for eternity unless you disassemble this set, which I certainly can&#39;t blame anyone for. Because the Lightning Jet is overfocused&nbsp;on this gimmick,&nbsp;<em>it doesn&#39;t include any guns.</em>&nbsp;Unless you are going to ram it (in which case a real-life jet would explode) it is completely helpless, and once it has been taken down Jay&nbsp;is unarmed unless he cannibalizes the jet and takes a blade off of it. This is one of those sets that by having 1 big play feature has no others, and thus even makes a bad toy.</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<p>This looks and feels like a $20 set, but it is not. It was originally&nbsp;$25, plus sales tax whatever it is. Even now when you can buy new for less than $25 or used for less than $20,&nbsp;<strong>don&#39;t.</strong> Unless you want it for parts like the wings. Then, unless you are doing a lightning-themed moc,&nbsp;take the stickers off, because they cover all the other rare pieces. This set escapes with 2 stars for that.</p>
