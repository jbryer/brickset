"Carnistir","2011-11-30T11:45:26.667Z","Ninja bike.  Cool!","<p>This set is cool, but a little bit too Power Ranger-ish.&nbsp; None the less, It's really cool.&nbsp;I will now present the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions.&nbsp; Lime green!</h4><p>Lots of lime green!&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; The box is moderately sized, and displays the set well.&nbsp; The instructions are simple, so that's good.&nbsp; 8/10</p>
<h4>Parts.&nbsp; Cool!</h4><p>Nice parts.&nbsp; New staff, headgear, armor, and knife pieces are great.&nbsp;The new armor holds two katanas.  Shrubery is cool, and works well with stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;9/10</p>
<h4>Minifigures!&nbsp; OH YEAH!</h4><p>Kai ZX is the best part.&nbsp; His gi features a body-armor print on the top, an a belt containing shurikens on the bottom.&nbsp; The back has a Fire symbol&nbsp;on it.&nbsp; Rattla is mediocre at best, but I'll give him this:&nbsp; His headpiece is real plastic!&nbsp; Not rubber!&nbsp; Yay! 10/10</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Excessive Technic.&nbsp; I don't like it.&nbsp; The bike is Technic, with bricks on top.&nbsp; It doesn't take that long to build, but it is not an entertaining build.&nbsp; The stand for the staff is cool, and the slime thing is nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/10</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The build will leave you with a bike that can fall apart easily.&nbsp; The transform will move farther to one side than the other, which annoys me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the bike is cool, and so is the stand for the staff.&nbsp; It is also very fun to play with.&nbsp; 8/10</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I recommend it, but know that it has some&nbsp;flaws.&nbsp; 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"Network","2011-12-01T13:33:19.39Z","Definitely a Power Rangers Feel","<div>Only my second set of Ninjago, and I'm still rather impressed. The overall feel of this set kinda reminds me a lot of Power Rangers crossed with Tron. I can totally dig it. The wheels are big and chunky, and there are lots of curves and angles.</div><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Parts</span></p><p>The parts are what I bought this set for (and I may buy more yet). There are lots of new parts, from the fold out giganto swords, the front slopes, and the long red slopes that make up the sides. Also we get some old parts in new colours such as the 1x1 clips in gold, 1x1 tooth in yellow and some hero factory spikes in gold. This set is definitely worth the price just for parts.</p><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Minifigures</span></div><p>This set comes with two mini's, I'll go into each individually.</p><p>Kai: This is where the Power Ranger vibe comes into play with his gold shoulder pads and the crest on his hood. It looks pretty menacing with his eyes scowling out at you. The hood no longer has the clip that holds a weapon, that function has been delegated to his fancy new shoulder armour. It has a circular form that will allow you to store both(!) included black swords. Kai looks way cooler with two swords coming over his shoulders. His hood, torso and legs are the same red as usual, however his arms are actually a deeper shade. The torso has nice printing on it alluding to layers of armour and hidden weaponry.</p><p>Rattla: He is certainly interesting. His headpiece, torso and legs are light grey. Dark blue with yellow highlights rundown the front. His headpiece has blue running down the top, but stops before it goes over his back. However, the piece continues to just above his waist and curls up into a pointed tail. Rattla's expression is pretty cool too, with one red eye larger than the other and a crooked smile showing more of one fang than another. judging from his swirly eyes and the gem on the staff, I'm only going to assume that he is some sort of hypnotist a la snake charmers. He's cool, but just not as cool as Kai.</p><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">The Build</span></div><div>The build was fun and rather interesting. I had to rush, but was fun to try and figure out exactly what the makers had in mind. Lots of layers and angles, but overall wasn't really that hard. The directions were easy to follow, if a bit slow. The book is quite thick but that's because sometimes they only put on one or two parts at a time.</div><p>Also included is a stand for the snake scepter. Some leaves and fire, as well as bright green tiles that I assume is supposed to represent venom. For a simple bit of terrain, I think it works well.</p><div>There are some stickers to apply to the front and sides of the bike, but I decided not to bother with them as I plan to take it apart shortly.</div><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">The Completed Model</span></p><p>The finished bike sure is ... something. Being red and gold, it strongly calls to mind once again, Power Rangers, however with those chunky tires it also reminds me a bit of the Tron Light Cycles. And I'm totally okay with that. However, I just wish it weren't so angular. It looks a bit messy with some smooth slopes and then hard edges. The colours work very well together, red and gold mostly with a bit of black, silver and light grey.</p><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">The gimmick is that when you push down on a part of the bike at the front, the wing blades pop out, however you have to manually push them back together. Not really a big deal but it would be nice if the blades popped out more.</span></h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">The other thing is that the scale seems to be just a teensy bit off. okay, a LOT off. Kai STANDS way at the back and he can't even see over the button that activates the blades. And when he is not on the bike it towers over him. Thankfully with the wide tires he won't have to worry about it toppling over on him.</span></h4><h4>Summary</h4><p>The end result of this set comes out a bit too messy for my liking. It's a solid build, the parts (for the most part) stay on well enough and there is a bit of heft to it. The gimmick is a tad weak and the scale is rather skewed. The minifigures are great and well detailed however. Also while the final model may not be MY fancy, there are a TON of new parts to play with. And that was my true intention of buying this set. The price was great at under 20 dollars, a true feat with lego sets with this many new and awesome parts.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:07:09.923Z","Not the best, but still very good!","<p>I received this set as a gift for Christmas and have finally decided to give it a review. While ninjas on motorcycles may not appeal to everybody, this set still has a lot of potential.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ninjas on Motorcycles! 
<li>Hybnobrai Staff. 
<li>Rattla and Kai ZX. 
<li>Pop-out blade feature. 
<li>It pretty stable when built, and looks good as well.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hypnobrai ""shrine"" looks a little too small; it needed extra pieces underneath the arch bricks. 
<li>Not very fun&nbsp;to build; the blades often get in the way and/or snap off. It is easier to add them at the end.</li></ul>

<p>Overall, this set is worthy to check out, especially if you are a Ninjago fan. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Mr_Malfoy","2012-03-31T12:02:06.253Z",""" I wish I could see your face now, because you just got Kai'd!""","<p>This set is a great buy (that is, if you can find it). I will be reviewing this set in five sections: Minifigures, The Shrine, The Blade Cycle, Playability, and Value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Kai ZX:</strong> A great minfigure. The upgraded armor, headband, and outfit is great. He comes with two black katanas. I do wonder where he got the scar on his face, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Rattla:</strong> The Scout of the Hypnobrai Tribe. He definitely has a cool pattern on his hood and torso. Rattla's eyes are also cool; very large and mesmerizing. He comes with a black spear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Shrine:</strong> Meh, it's OK. When you remove the staff, it looks, well ... odd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Blade Cycle:</strong> The highlight of the set. The opening blade function is really cool, but it would've been nice if the blades opened up equally. The gold details is a nice touch. The stickers showing flames really make the vehicle fromidable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong> You can play for hours with this set (it goes well with 9440).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> For 188 pieces at $14.99, it's a great value.</p>

"StynaMN","2012-03-20T22:31:02.163Z","Kai's Blade Cycle","<p>I got this set for a birthday gift this year, and I really have enjoyed it. Great pieces come with it, and the minifigs are pretty awesome, too.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box explains the functions, and tells what staff comes with the set. Instructions for the set are normal, and I found the part with the alternating layers of blades a bit confusing, but I got it fixed.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Great pieces! Nice gold staff, gold wheels, gold blades, gold jagged blades, gold bionicle blades, red bionicle eyes, and some neat Kai-themed sticker pieces! I also like the medium orange-colored teeth and silver studs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Rattla, the snake minifig, has the nice new headpiece, and a patterned body. He is pretty common in some of the new sets, but still good overall.</p><p>Kai ZX has the gold shoulder armor, and the two black katanas in the sheath on his back. His new suit definitely has a great pattern on it, and the gold on the headpiece is nice.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was normal, what you would expect from a 15 dollar set. It's simple, but like I said before, if you don't follow the part with the folding blades exactly right, you might have a bit of trouble.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a cool-looking set, and does have some playability. When you hit the button at the front, the blades pop out on the sides. Nice finished model!</p>

"Kalhiki","2012-06-18T12:52:39.803Z","Snake fighting, spinning ninjas now with motorcycles.","<p>Been a while since I've done a review. And since I just recently got this set, I thought, ""what the heck, I'll review it"". So what does this magical motorcycle have in store for you, the buyer? Read on!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is of a decent size. It features all the information like set number, part count, and set name that's standard, along with the equally standard picture of the set. In this case it's Kai on his Blade Cycle who's probably just taking a nice ride. Meanwhile, in an attempt to destroy Kai's enjoyment, Rattle is leaping from a pedastal thingy trying to hypnotize (or attack using soundwaves as it looks) the motorcycle. And, of note is the little picture saying the set ""CONVERTS"".</p>
<p>The back features the set's... Features. Primarily, how to convert the Cycle. We also see that this set comes with the Hypnobrai Staff. And, apparently, Kai's not happy that Rattla ruined his day as we can see him chasing him with his swords drawn.</p>
<p>The instructions are made of paper, which is&nbsp;expected in Lego sets.&nbsp;It's full of pictures, and, as you may have guessed, guide you through the build process. Of note is the little break in the middle that features artwork of the Snake Generals and Ninjas fighting over the Hypnobrai&nbsp;Staff, a weapon checklist, and some of the other sets released in the same wave.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Parts are actually pretty good. You get lots of nice, curved red pieces, which may come in handy if you're building a mech of some kind. And you have some cool gold blades in case you need some weapons. My favorite of these is the smaller version of the Rattlecopter's blades. </p>
<p>As for Minifig accessories, you get the new Ninja gear. The hood is great as it allows you more head articulation than the older ones. But my favorite piece is the shoulder armor which has two slots where you can store two swords, which looks great. You also get the snake hood and the aformentioned Snake Staff (still love the look of that piece).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>You get Kai in his ZX gear! He features some nice printing that shows off some belts and armor holding together his cloth pajamas underneath. His back has his little fire-headed lion symbol thing as well as some more armor. His face is very simple and looks very focused. He also has a scar over his left eye.</p>
<p>You also get Rattla! Not much to say about him. He has nice printing on his body and hood making him look nice a scaley. The head shows him with a sinister look; fangs showing, one eye open wide, the other squinting. Also to mention with the eyes are the lovely hypnotic rings.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was simple but entertaining. I didn't experience may problems, so that's always a good thing. But, I was a little disappointed with the converting mechanism. I really thought it would be more than what it was.</p>
<p>The Staff's pedastal really doesn't need to be gone over.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The model is great. The pedastal, once again, doesn't need to be gone over as it's mainly just there to hold the staff.</p>
<p>The Cycle is the real meat and potatoes, though. It truely does pull off the look of a bike. It's a decent size for a set, but for a Minifig, it would be the biggest bike in the world. I guess this is good if you want to run over snakes who are giving you a bad day.&nbsp;Speaking of running things over, the wheels roll very freely,&nbsp;so it can&nbsp;go pretty far. But, of course, this works best on a flat, hard surface.&nbsp;Also, as is usual with Lego sets, it comes with stickers, but I feel they should be applied because otherwise, you just have a red motorcycle. Plus, these flame decals mixed with the plates on the front of the bike just make it look like it's puking out flames.</p>
<p>Now for the conversion. It's a really simple mechanism that mainly focuses on things pushing other things out of the way.&nbsp; By pushing&nbsp;a red piece&nbsp;right behind the piece that features Kai's lion symbol,&nbsp;the side panels are pushed out of the way. This, in turn, pushes&nbsp;the side panels&nbsp;under it away. The final effect is a bike that's ready to&nbsp;come&nbsp;at you and slice you to bits. I've heard people complain that the plates&nbsp;don't go out very far out, and while this can be fixed&nbsp;by manually by pulling the pieces out, I like how it looks how it is.&nbsp;The bike&nbsp;looks broken up with blades flashing while still pulling off an aerodynamic look.&nbsp;My only complaint is that the panels can pop off, and usually won't come out symmetrically.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I feel this is a great set. Whether you're collecting the Ninja's vehicles, or increasing your Hypnobrai army, you won't be disspointed. Heck, even you're just a casual collecter thinking about this set, I don't think you'll be sorry. The Minifigs look great, and the converting&nbsp;feature, while simple, is very fun.&nbsp;Fifteen dollars is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reasonable price, so I highly recommend this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
