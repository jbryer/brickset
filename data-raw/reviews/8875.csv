<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly long, and zooms in on the set a lot.&nbsp; It makes the set look bigger than it really is.&nbsp; The instructions are easy-to-follow, and very good, as usual.&nbsp; 8/10</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Great parts!&nbsp; Fangpyre Staff, Shurikens, a ninja sword,&nbsp;and dynamite comprise the weapons. The ninja's shoulder armor are really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tail, snake heads, and ninja hood pieces&nbsp;are other nice parts.&nbsp; Also, the tires are great!&nbsp; 9/10</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Jay ZX- Jay ZX is very cool, and has a very good color scheme: Blue and Silver.&nbsp; I like that. Zane ZX- Zane ZX is also cool.&nbsp; His color scheme is as good as Jay's: White and Gold.&nbsp; Cool! Fangdam- Fangdam has two heads, which is odd.&nbsp; His colors are red, white, and black. Fangtom- Fangtom is mostly red, with some white and black.&nbsp; He has a snake tail and two heads.&nbsp; 10/10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build...</h4><p>...is hard.&nbsp; I'm not are really fast builder, either.&nbsp; I don't like the Technic in the truck.&nbsp; The Snowmobile is easier to build.&nbsp; I enjoy the snowmobile.&nbsp; It's really cool :P 7/10</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Yes!&nbsp; This thing is awesome when it's complete.&nbsp; The build provides you with a fairly large truck with a smacking tail.&nbsp; The mouth doesn't open when the set is on the ground, though.&nbsp; And the tail falls off sometimes.&nbsp; But, it's still cool.&nbsp; 10/10</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, It's really good, and I reccommend it.&nbsp; It's really cool.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

After getting ""Jay's Storm Fighter"" I decided to get a few more for Christmas. I ended up buying this (mostly for Zane's snowmobile thing)and enjoying it.<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The&nbsp;Fangpyre&nbsp;Truck makes a good addition to your Fangpyre army, and is the only way to get Zane's snowmobile in a box. This set comes with Fangtom and Fangdam (who's names are very confusing),Jay and Zane. You can't get an amazing amount of&nbsp;play-ability&nbsp;out of each of these alone,but together they are very fun. After all, I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this to ""Rise of the Snakes"" fans. If you like original stuff, than I don't recommend this to you.</div>",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
