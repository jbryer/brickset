"Matt_Z_","2012-02-16T18:17:37.983Z","An Intriguing Design for an Intriguing Theme","<p class=""MsoNormal"">At first glance, I didn’t really ""get"" what the Ninjago
theme line was all about. As a fan of the “classic” ninja sets, I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;understand how The Lego Group was incorporating futuristic ideas into a ninja
genre. But after picking up 9446 Destiny’s Bounty, I was surprised at how they
managed to pull it off. &nbsp;I’ll give a
rundown of some pros and cons of this set and finish off with a conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br>
</p><p><b>Pros</b></p><p></p><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; "">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; -&nbsp;</b></span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; ""><b>Exceptional Minifigures:</b> One of the first
highlights of this set that must be mentioned has to be the minifigures. You’ll
receive six minifigs, which is a good amount, all with their own unique
flavour. The wise and majestic Sensei Wu with a unique hat and white beard, Kendo
Jay and Kendo Zane, Skales and Slithra who are very neat snake figurines that
any collector would love to have, and Lord Garmadon, a unique figure with FOUR
arms (and a bone on his helmet)! All in all these figurines offer a great
variety and help set the tone of this set.</span></ul><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; "">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; -&nbsp;</b></span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; ""><b>Unique “Ship” Design:</b> Initially, it&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;readily apparent that the boat/ship on the cover had an alternate form: a
<b>flying</b> ship. This helped me understand how versatile the Ninjago line can be
and how playability can be extended. This unique design offers increased options
and value for your money. It can stay as a ship in your Lego collection, or it
can be a flying vessel in a more futuristic Lego set-up. An easy, efficient, and
interesting lever system allows the sails to instantly become wings, and vice
versa. Couple this with the sides of the boat converting to “engines” and you’ll
find a very intriguing Lego set.</span></ul><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; "">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; ""><b>Other features:</b> The set has a working anchor, working
cannon, hidden treasure/weapon caches, a steering wheel, plenty of extra
weapons, an adjustable roof, new elements, a golden staff, and much more. Plus a really cool
Dragon’s head on the front of the ship! Attention to detail is readily apparent
throughout the set and will certainly keep you busy.</span></ul><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; ""><br></span></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; ""><b>Cons</b></span></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; "">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; "">When choosing Ninjago based products, you really
need an open mind. While this set is very unique, some may argue that it has a
bizarre design and that Ninjago is “trying to do too many things at once.” They&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;be entirely wrong to say that. However, the “bizarre” nature is what
defines this set and it is this style that brings with it the increased
versatility and playability.</span></ul><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; "">&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; "">As always, the set is a bit pricey. At $99.99
CDN, you’ll really want to make sure it’s your cup of tea. But with all that it
offers, few will walk away disappointed.</span></ul><ul><span style=""text-indent: -18pt; "">- While unique, I still think that Kendo Jay and
Kendo Zane look more like hockey goalies than ninjas.</span></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><!--[if !supportLists]--><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">For Ninjago fans, 9446 Destiny’s Bounty should already be
top priority on your wishlists. For others, this set can be what you want it to
be, whether you collect Lego ships of all sorts or whether you’re into
futuristic designs.&nbsp;Collectors of all
themes will find something rewarding in this set. Personally, this set is
currently docked in the harbour of my Medieval Castle set-up, as a trade vessel
from overseas, and it’s working out quite nicely. Overall, a very unique set
with a ton of versatility and playability. Definitely recommended.</p>

"Ypres","2012-03-07T20:15:18.423Z","A Definitive Set for 2012","<p>As an avid, but selective, NinjaGo buyer I quickly came to like and acquire Destiny's Bounty. What seems like a design straight out of a&nbsp;Japanese-RPG became a modern hallmark for Lego's desire to inspire young builders. The Dragon-winged sails come protected in plastic with a small sheet of cardboard to keep them straight in the box. The sail's function is sophisticated yet easy to comprehend at the same time... what remains engraved to&nbsp;memory is predominantly its beauty! There are no hidden compartments (aside from obvious weapon stashes) for playability, so you should know exactly what you're paying for before you buy it. I bought this set for just under $80 CAN, which to me is about right (Considering American buyers would be paying just above that amount). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building the set was fun and, as memory and appearance serves, has no repetitive&nbsp;steps like we see in various winged symmetrical models. Kids are more than capable of putting this together in one sitting if supervised and should have no trouble grasping the wing/sail function element(s). Buyers like myself should be highly <strong>CAUTIONED</strong> because the new kendo minifigures do not actually come with new outfits. This is still a great set, however, don't feel the desire to buy separate sets (9558 &amp; 9551) because of the need to ""complete"" your ninja collection. The armour they're wearing&nbsp;is instantly recognizable as the old-school samurai design, while the kendo helmets (being new) look alike on all four ninjas...&nbsp;in other words what you're looking at is their original outfits featured in NinjaGo's first release!&nbsp;At the very least owning this set does give you two kendo outfits for play-sparring between two ninjas, etc. There's really not much else in the set for ""mystery"", so what you see is exactly what you'll have to look forward to come purchase time!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My only complaint (for which I provided my own artificial remedy) is that the Dragon boat has no stand/base for its flying mode. This might not strike kids as all that important given the fact that you can easily pick it up and fly it around in your hands, BUT if you want to display it I suggest using practical stands of your own. What I found to work quite well was the stands from the old space monorail playset. Pricing... when is that not ever a CON these days!? If retired, I myself would still feel comfortable paying just above the Canadian retail of $100, but then again, nobody yet knows the future sell value of NinjaGo. I know I will hold onto Destiny's Bounty until the day I part with my entire collection... so you won't ever be bidding on mine! </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Tramapolean","2012-05-16T22:46:26.73Z","A surprisingly brilliant set!","I picked this set up recently because I was craving another Lego ship after building the imperial flagship, queen anne's revenge and the black pearl. I did not have high hopes as it is from the Ninjago series, which strikes me as a pretty silly little series to be blunt. Well, I use to anyway!<br><br>This set is a very interesting build, with some great pieces and construction techniques, that then makes for a very playable set with some great swoosh factor too! Very swooshable in fact as it can work as both a ocean going vessel and an airship.<br><br>Beyond these surprises, the dragon prow, ram, moving sails with a really elegant rig, hidden compartments, stylish railings with weaponry, rotating firing cannon, deck canopy that can flip open, rotating wings for flight or sea mode, and a couple of very good licking printed banners! Wow!<br><br>Even full priced, this is a brilliant set! At the discounted price it seems to be kicking around though it is an amazing bargain! Very impressive!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"mathew","2012-07-03T10:54:53.827Z","Destiny's Dragster","<p>If you like ships and Technic then you'll probably like Destiny's Bounty.&nbsp; I myself am not a huge fan of Technic as the final models often have a skeletal look to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Destiny's Bounty unfortunately looks a little incomplete and skeletal as a completed model.&nbsp; In fact it reminds me more of a hotrod&nbsp;than a fully featured battle ship.&nbsp; I would of liked a larger model, perhaps 1,000 pcs. with&nbsp;a complete hull and lower deck.&nbsp; That's not to say that I don't like it.&nbsp; The overall engineering and design&nbsp;are a true marvel.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's actually the perfect size for ""swooshing"" around the room although it lacks a good place to grip the bottom.&nbsp; It's fun to flap the sails like wings (the ship resembles a Dragon afterall)&nbsp;however that often causes one of the little tooth pieces&nbsp;to pop loose.&nbsp; It's the first time I'm tempted to actually glue a Lego piece.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigs are fine.&nbsp; I'm not crazy about snake guys&nbsp;and the extra battle suits the Ninjas wear.&nbsp; I do like Sensei Wu and he looks cool pioliting the ship.&nbsp; The snake totem (or whatever it is) seems un-necessary and is there just to give the snakes something to hang out and worship.&nbsp; I'll be parting it out soon enough.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum it up:&nbsp; Definitely the best model of all the Ninjago sets.&nbsp; Would love to see a UCS&nbsp;version though.&nbsp; The final size and somewhat incomplete looks make it more of a older boy's toy than something a AFOL will want to display.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"brickspy","2015-02-01T22:23:34.8Z","Maybe My New Favorite LEGO Ship!","<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/YL1J-ktKAL4"">http://youtu.be/YL1J-ktKAL4</a></p>

<p>This is a great set, and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t miss out on getting it. &nbsp;I just cracked into the box to review the set for my YouTube channel, only wish I had done so when I first purchased the set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set is well designed. &nbsp;The set contains two instruction booklets, which were not folded in half (a rare treat with LEGO sets). &nbsp;The instructions were easy to follow as usual, however I did have a hard time determining which head to use for Zane and Jay as it was hard to tell in the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As usually there were a few extra tiny pieces, but none missing (there never are...)</p>

<p>Sensei Wu&#39;s hat... While it looks cool, it honestly doesn&#39;t feel like a LEGO piece. &nbsp;I suspect the designer&#39;s attempt was to make it look as realistic as possible, but it just feels foreign, and doesn&#39;t have the feel of a regular LEGO piece.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build went smoothly. &nbsp;I did a time-lapse build video for my channel on YouTube, unfortunately my camera kept overheating (obviously not a LEGO problem...)</p>

<p>My disdain for stickers was amplified by this set, there were round stickers to place on the round tile pieces for the jet engines, however getting a round sticker on a round tile perfectly is impossible... so they are all uneven...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion of this set is that the set is AMAZING. &nbsp;Despite my sticker problem, I did enjoy building this set... I am keeping this one constructed and placing it on my shelf!</p>
