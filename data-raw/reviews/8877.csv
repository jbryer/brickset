 I&nbsp;first saw this set on other Technic websites. Right then I had decided to buy this set when it&#39;s available. As the title says this set has a great value for money, it has 954 pieces for $70 which I think is a very good price for this set. It has realistic functions plus you can motorize the tow-fork and winch with set 8293, the best part all the pieces you need to motorize this set are provided. As to the design of the truck, the truck has a compact design and looks realistic, considering the size of the set. When motorized, the motor does stick out of the back( not a big deal because you can lower the fork, right above the motor so it doesn&#39;t look that the motor is sticking out. for more reference there is a link to my video at the bottom of this review.</p>
<h4>
 Pros</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Opening doors and hood</p>
  <p>
   Reclining seats</p>
  <p>
   Detailed cabin</p>
  <p>
   V4 engine</p>
  <p>
   HOG steering</p>
  <p>
   Decent turning radius</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h4>
 Cons</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   The tow-fork doesn&#39;t rotate,(hard to turn while towing a vehicle)</p>
  <p>
   I wanted to see a v6</p>
  <p>
   It would have looked more detailed and heavy duty if the rear axle had 2 wheels &nbsp; on each end, like 8285</p>
  <p>
   The indicators on the front and side of the truck could have been more detailed</p>
  <p>
   Should have had a working steering wheel(in cabin)</p>
  <p>
   When motorized the light bar cant be fitted</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Don&#39;t take me wrong, even though there are somethings I would have liked to see in this set, it is still a brilliant set for it offers at an affordable price. Personally I really like the black color. Also this set looks great on the shelf (where ever displayed) good job on this LEGO!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set includes only the instructions for the A model. The B model instructions are available in PDF for download from the Lego website. Only including the A model instructions and making the B model instructions available electronically has been the trend with Lego in recent years. I&#39;m indifferent about this trend. Sure, it&#39;s nice to have a physical copy of instructions in front of you when building a model, but it also uses a lot of paper and adds to the overall weight and price. Besides, with today&#39;s proliferation of tablets and other electronic devices, it&#39;s actually quite convenient to have electronic instructions. In fact, I always download the A model instructions too so that I have an electronic copy of them as well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is just shy of 1000 pieces, and with a US$70 price tag, you get a lot of value for your money.</p>

<p>This model comes with a great assortment of parts that are useful for a large variety of builds. First, it comes with a differential and four cylinder piston engine. It also includes four wheel knob gears and a transmission ring, among the 27 gears included in this kit. In addition to the good amount of gears, this set includes several black panels, including the rare large black panels that, to this day, are only found in one other set!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I have greatly enjoyed the build of this model. I taken it apart and have rebuilt it several times, and I find it a joy to build every time. I especially enjoyed building the transmission and compact gear mechanism that is used to drive the winch and the towing boom.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the build includes a perfect amount of interesting and intricate techniques and mechanisms for building it from start to end in one sitting without losing interest or getting exhausted.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model looks great! Once it&#39;s built, I have a hard time wanting to take it apart because it looks so good. Part of what makes it look so good is the excellent use of black panels that cover up the gaps and spaces typically found in modern Technic sets. Also, speaking of black, that was a perfect choice of color for this model.</p>

<p>The model has good playability. I really like how the function selector was elegantly implemented using a lever beside the driver&#39;s seat for switching between the winch and lowering/raising the tow boom.</p>

<p>While I think this is an excellent model, I do believe there is some room for a few minor improvements. It would have been nice to have dual rear wheels and a V6 or V8 engine like the real vehicle. However, that would have of course driven the price up. Also, it would have been nice if the towing boom could swivel side to side rather than being rigid.</p>

<p>The set includes instructions for adding power functions, i.e. the Lego electric motors. The instructions call for one of the common medium sized motors to be placed at the back of the truck. The mechanics of the installed motor work well and are fun to operate, but unfortunately the motor sticks out the back of the truck and looks out of place.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a wonderful set. I highly recommend it for its parts, looks, and value.</p>
