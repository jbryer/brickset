I builded the jet plane first and wanted to look how the ""old"" fighter was but didnt manage tearing my new plane a part so i had to buy another one :)</p><p>Best of all... I dont regret that choise, cuse the both looks pretty ool on my shelf !<br><br>Just buy, dont think twice.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"zanthrax","2012-01-14T20:40:49.04Z","Big model, nice functions, low price. What's not to like?","<p>The thing that surprised most me while building this jet is how large it is. It's a lot larger than pictures and the box size suggest.</p><p>The sets contains an above average amount of pieces for it's price, most parts are regular parts like beams and connectors. There aren't many more expensive,&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;parts like&nbsp;linear&nbsp;actuators, suspension components or big, rubber tires besides one rim and 2 toothed beams which explains the low price per piece for this set. There are a lot of panels that help making the plane look very sleek, I especially like the way the air inlets besides the cockpit are made with 2 small panels. It's simple and effective.</p><p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow, as usual. Instructions for the main model are separated over 2 books, the second model, a propellor plane, has one book.</p><p>There is a large sticker sheet that covers a lot of the panels but this plane already looks great without then.</p><p>The plane has 4 functions:</p><p>- The cockpit canopy opens, this is operated by a gear behind it that is a bit difficult to reach for adult fingers.</p><p>- A small knob under the left wing raises and lowers the landing gear. I really like the way the wheels under the wings fold in. They make the bottom look very nice. This mechanism contains most of the gears in this set, there are 18 in total.</p><p>- Turning the black 'jet outlet' on the end rotates the wings in and out. The mechanism that does this is nice and simple but does make the tail a bit bulky.</p><p>- The control stick moves back and forth to move the tail wings. Too bad moving it from left to right doesn't move a pair of flaps on the wings like on the 8855 seaplane. But this is forgivable because the moving wings would make this difficult to&nbsp;achieve and there isn't any room left in the hull for an additional mechanism.</p><p>The sets has some room for improvements and modifications. I'm thinking about adding an ejection seat since 4 of the stickers reference one. While doing that I also would like to reenforce the front section, it's a bit floppy.</p><p>On the whole, I like this set very much. It's affordable, looks great from any angle, has many fun functions that work nicely and it's a lot of fun to swoosh around the living room.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of panels and gears.</li><li>Great value for money.</li><li>Looks very nice without stickers.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Control stick only operates in one direction.</li><li>Odd placement of landing gear knob.</li><li>Front is a bit floppy.</li></ul>
<p>Highly recommended, my favorite of the first wave of Technic sets for 2012.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"kaans","2013-08-14T18:39:17.18Z","Above expectations","<p>This set was far more fun that I imagined it would be.</p><p>I buy Lego's for the build, but the end result was also very pleasing with this set, function/size ratio is really high.</p><p>The only really minor con could be the wings, but generally it's a great set/model, much better looking in person, really fun/mid-length build. One of the best for me.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Matthias_K","2016-12-06T23:12:31.4Z","This jet soars","<p>A jet is a very unusual choice for a Technic set. It&#39;s very difficult to replicate the needed&nbsp;sleek lines&nbsp;with Technic parts and still have room for functions. The designer of this set did not create the sleekest of jets, but did manage to create a big&nbsp;model and&nbsp;include a whopping four functions with only a few parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was much less enamored with the B-model. It doesn&#39;t look as good as the A-model and has less functions (2 of which are copied&nbsp;from the A-model). I build this model once and disassembled it within a day.</p>

<p>All in all: this set can be had for only a little money and the jet is easily worth it.&nbsp;</p>
