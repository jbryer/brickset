started building it as soon as i got home. It was very easy to build and
 took about 20-30 mins to complete. The front is a bright orange color (
 i have never bought a technic set with orange pieces so i was pleased 
with it) with a small piece representing the light there were blue seats
 (not mini figure size) and 1x2 transparent plates used as headlights.<br>The backside is red with a couple of grey elements.<br><br><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>nice orange pieces<br></li><li>good price</li><li>some spare pieces</li><li>cute<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing much really, it is very easy to build and on the back-end of the truck, there is a gear and next to it there is and empty space on the axle, it looks unfinished so maybe they could have added a piece there or something. But other than that, the tow truck is pretty AWESOME!</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, this is a nice 2012 set and it is only 7 pounds! great for kids and it is a good beginners set! highly recomended!<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3
"GarethMoore","2012-01-09T16:20:38.163Z","Poor Effort","This set is not a patch on last year's smallest Technic set, the 8065 Mini Container Truck. That set was clever and had some very interesting design - this set, by contrast, has no clever mechanical component (there's just a friction pin holding a reel of cotton in place for the hook, and a simple steering mechanism) and some surprisingly poor design.<div><br></div><div>The design has two flaws. First, the front two wheels have bushes on whereas the back two don't, which looks very ugly, and secondly the red crane unit is lacking a friction pin and so is very loose and wobbly - not very plausible for a crane. The cheapness in excluding these three small parts spoils the model.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, it has lots of nice orange Technic parts and it looks nice enough (wheels excepted!).</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"zeeverse","2012-03-06T23:03:53.023Z","A Solid Technic Mini Set!","<p>When I saw the release info on this set, I knew it would be in my collection for a lot of reasons. First, and foremost, it is a mini-Unimog. That for me is a great thing because I can actually afford this mini Technic Set! Second, this set returns to the classic technic wheel without the protruding hub - Yay! For what I do, these wheels are much more fun and interesting to work with. Third, the 9390 might be one of the first Technic Mini-Sets to actually offer two functions! I can't remember a set that did that before, so for me, this is actually a really cool feature for the 9390! Kudos to Lego's designers for pulling off a new experience.</p><p><br></p><p>In building the A-model, it was yet another experience for me in learning a new way to put together a steering linkage system. And I had to spend a few minutes marveling at how well it works in spite of the very unusual design. Assembling the A-model was enjoyable and well worth the $12USD price tag. The creative solution for adding the second function to this kit, which is a working hoist, was really neat to see done, and build, as well. The lift is not super strong, but with a Mini Technic Model, compromises have to be made. And I think all of the right compromises were made in delivering this mini-Unimog model with two working functions in a mini kit for less than $12USD. What a fun building experience. There are lots of opportunities to customize this model into a Unimog with different configurations, and I'm going to have a lot of fun designing those other fun items (a trailer comes to mind!).</p><p><br></p><p>The B-model for this kit builds a more artistic looking car design that also features functioning steering. Now, when it comes to a B-model in the mini-Technic line, I'm always very open-minded towards the effort on the Lego designers to come up with a second build. And I was surprised at how well this vehicle design stretches the small parts of the 9390 kits into a longer car body. Nicely done, Lego designers.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - A surprising two functions in a mini Technic Kit! Wow! I'm impressed!<br></li><li>Pro 2 - The A - model looks great, and the B - model looks interesting<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - Could use a few more parts to really make the A-model look complete (rear bumper would have been really nice.).<br></li><li>Con 2 - Orange is a great color, but a red, blue, or yellow version would have been much more useful parts-wise for me.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I think the Lego Technic 9390 is a great kit. I will be picking up a few extra 9390 Kits throughout the year given the awesome price and the useful parts. As a collector, I think the Lego Technic 9390 is a very unique mini-Technic Set because it offers a great looking A-model with two functions. Given that unique feature, I had no reservations in adding it to my collection!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Steers better than that model, too.</div><div>It's a quick, fun build but I do have to ask why the instructions for the main model are split into 2 tiny books when the B model instructions are one, larger and much better, book. Strange...</div><div><br></div><div>The model itself looks good for the size and it has a cleverly done steering linkage which works unusually well. The rear part, however, could stand some improvement. The tow hook is operated by the simplest means possible, and there's too much friction to use it easily. There's space back there to give it a proper worm gear driven mechanism. Still, a set this small having two functions of any kind is pretty good; it's just that the towing hook feels like a bit of an afterthought.</div><div><br></div><div>The B model - a race car of some kind - makes good use of the pieces to build something very different, and I like the way you use what looks like the driver's head to steer it. A nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it's a sweet little thing and a good enough way to spend those VIP points.</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,5
"astarguy","2012-03-11T16:57:04.1Z","good effort","This is my first review due to the fact that i do not write well. <br>this is a good mini technic set for the money i love to collect trucks and this was a easy buy. the biggest thing i didn't like is the fact the winch is only supported on one side. i am going to look and see if i have any spare parts to correct this flaw. other than that i really like to orange cab. for me i like the color. the steering is very well thought out other than i feel that the turning radius on most lego's is to large. i hope that people find this helpful. thanks.<br>",TRUE,3,4,5,5,5
