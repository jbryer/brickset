The design really makes parts count, as weighing in at 199 it is almost identical to 2006's 8282 Quad Bike's 200 pieces while providing a significantly more realistic look and more functions. The orange and black scheme looks good, and the stickers accent both the A and B model very well. Instruction booklets are included for both models.<br><br>The A-model is outstandingly detailed, looking very close to an actual quad/all-terrain vehicle. Despite the low parts count, assembly is interesting and challenging since the design takes full advantage of angled Technic beams and the unusual geometry they make possible. The handlebars function but the steering is wobbly and imprecise due to the geometry and play that the front suspension set unfortunately introduces. There is very little space in the model for steering, however I feel that there still is some room for improvement here. The chain drive for the engine works quite well, with less skipping and catching than I've seen from most of the other sets using the newer revisions of the chain links.<br><br>The B-model resembles a typical radio-controlled buggy. It retains full suspension and steering, but the steering mechanism is even sloppier than the A-model's. Despite this, I find the steering mechanism to be interesting from a technical standpoint as it takes advantage of the same play between parts that cause its wobbliness in the first place. Most B-models in a set with stickers can end up looking silly if the decals had been applied, however, this model still looks normal since the numbers and patterns can be of either orientation.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of special parts.</li><li>Very detailed A-model.</li><li>Full suspension.</li><li>Good color scheme.</li><li>Instructions for both A and B model included.</li><li>Inexpensive.<br></li></ul>

<p>9392 Quad Bike gets almost everything right, only the marginal steering mechanisms keep it from a perfect score. The set has plenty of functions and special parts, excellent design, a pleasing color and decal scheme, a fair challenge with building, and excellent fun.<br></p><p>On a miscellaneous note, the fit and tolerances of most of the parts are noticeably improved over those made in the previous 3-4 years.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

<p>I just finished building this set and I'll have to agree with pretty much everything the previous reviewer said.&nbsp; The comparison to the 8282 Quad Bike from a few years ago is unavoidable, and this set wins in almost every respect, except for the steering (as the previous reviewer noted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build took me almost an hour, and, despite the small size of this set, I found it fairly intriguing.&nbsp; One of the things that makes it interesting is that the frame of the bike is constructed by attaching liftarms at various unusual angles, rather than the typical parallel or perpendicular angles.&nbsp; I liked that the instructions included special, extra&nbsp;side-on views at several points in the build to assist the builder in making sure that the liftarms are joined correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the model is built, you have a nice looking four wheeler.&nbsp; The color scheme, which makes use of the orange parts introduced with the Unimog, is awsome.&nbsp; The functions in the A model are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent suspension for each of the front wheels. 
<li>Suspension for the entire rear axle as a unit. 
<li>Steering via the handlebars. 
<li>A single-cylinder dummy engine driven via a chain connected to the rear axle.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspension, both front and rear, works very nicely -- it seems to be tuned just right.&nbsp; The frame will bottom out if you push down hard on the front suspension, but that is not a major issue, since there is plenty of clearance for a decent amount of travel in the front springs.&nbsp; The drive train also works great.&nbsp; The chain is fairly taut and doesn't skip or bind up as in some other sets.&nbsp; The only function that has a problem is the steering, which is loose and has an extremely limited range of motion.&nbsp; The links used in the steering linkage simply have too much play to be used in combination with the short steering arms.&nbsp; Even worse, the steering geometry exhibits a very slight ""reverse Ackermann"" effect -- the outer wheel turns slightly more sharply than the inner wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts inventory is very good.&nbsp; The suspension/steering parts include 3 springs, 4 control arms, and&nbsp;2 steering arms.&nbsp; You also get the single cylinder block and piston,&nbsp;as well as 27 chain links, which are very useful.&nbsp; The orange panels, liftarms, and connectors are also great to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I have a very positive opinion of this set.&nbsp; It is a big improvement over its predecessor, and at&nbsp;US $25.00 it is a great deal.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Capit√°n_Skrall","2012-04-29T18:20:01.127Z","A really cool quad  ","So, another Technic quad bike. This time including 199 pieces of which 27 are chain links. We're also getting some panels, wheels and three shock absorbers.<div><br></div><div>The main model uses almost all the available pieces. While having a simple design and built with less than 200 pieces the finished model is quite impressive. The model has covered all the main functions (and the way these are accomplished) that a real quad bike could have. The front axle has steering and suspension via shock absorbers, and the rear axle includes suspension and it powers the piston engine with a chain.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of looks it's recognizable. Actually it's a really good looking model when finished thanks to the panels and the nice black wheels. But they kept this one really simple, nothing more than the absolutely necessary for the overall details. It would have been nice if we had a seat and an exhaust pipe.</div><div><br></div><div>It's so far a cool model in terms of inventory and design. Also delivers a great play experience. It's a nice, bouncy ride on the desk (at least it's how I played with it). However, the steering ratio isn't the best, the set would have been bigger and more expensive with another steering system. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As usual we get instructions for another build. Not the best looking buggy I've seen, but I guess it does the necessary and is a secondary model after all.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, a recommendable model if you're after the steering links, shock absorbers and some wheels or just for a good looking model for playing around. A really cool set overall.</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"DrFrankenstein","2012-05-18T17:57:25.613Z","A very enjoyable economy set","<p>Overall, this is a very enjoyable set that is worthy of the Technic brand name. The build is quick but interesting demonstrating of the stud-less construction possibilities at their best. The final result is a handsome ATV-like bike that has a soft bounciness to its suspension. One can hardly ask for more from a set in this price range. <br></p><p>The only downside to the model is the steering, which has limited range and doesn't feel good.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice looking model<br></li><li>Interesting parts<br></li><li>Fun build</li><li>Reasonable price</li><li>Awesome suspension and chain mechanisms<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Imprecise and limited steering<br></li></ul>
<p>If it weren't for the shabby steering, I'd say this set is perfect. <br></p><p>P.S. IMHO the quad bike is the most attractive of the somewhat disappointing 1H2012 lineup. It's not exactly a strong start for the Technic brand this year. Let's hope that the 2H2012 sets are more exciting.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

As a result I had almost no expectations of what to expect other than I know it was huge fun when I was young. As a building experience it was fantastic, almost an hour of building, then another hour of building to get to the secondary vehicle (A race car) then another hour of building to return to the Quad which is a far better kit.</div><div><br></div><div>This kit sits on my desk and gets a workout whenever I need a break, it easily handles jumping and driving over my keyboard as well as any other items I have loosely sitting around the place.</div><div><br></div><div>The only downfall that I see (which has been mentioned already) is that the suspension bottoms out quite easily, however, the build is really great with a very slick layout that isn't rigid up and down, left and right like a lot of other kits I have seen in the past.</div><div><br></div><div>A great buy at an awesome price!</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
