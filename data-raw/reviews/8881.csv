It's no secret that I love tracked vehicles, I love the Lego Technic Mini Construction Equipment kits, and I dig cranes. Needless to say, I happily picked this little gem off of the shelf and took it home to build.<br><br>The A model is awesome, and the build was very interesting. I always start with assembling the tracks first thing off the bat. I don't know why, but I just have to do it that way after building several Lego Technic tracked vehicles. And these small tracks are awesome. I've loved them ever since I built the Lego Technic 8259 Mini Bulldozer kit. And needless to say, I parked my freshly completed 9391 Tracked Crane right next to my 8259 Mini Bulldozer and they both look like they're ready to take on any construction site.<br><br>The B model for this kit is a surprise, and by surprise, I mean in a good sense. The B model is unusual in that I found that it is just as good a design as the A model, and that's always a nice bonus in a Lego Technic kit. The B model builds a medium sized bulldozer in Mini Scale and the B model looks right at home also next to my 8259 Mini Bulldozer. Of course, having already loved the A model, I was forced to go out and pick up another 9391 kit so I could enjoy both models at the same time. <br><br>In short, If a Lego Technic fan likes tracked vehicles, cranes, or bulldozers then I would think that the Lego Technic 9391 will find a lot of fans and could possibly be one of those kits that Lego Builders will have multiples of in their collections. In short, the 9391 is a great kit just on the single aspect of having what I think are awesome A and B models. I think it offers a lot of bang for the buck.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There's not much to say about the box and instructions of this model. It's a normal box with A model on the front and the B model on the back. This model has the ""new"" type of Technic instructions were the beams are less detailed. I don't like that very much.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This is a great small parts set:</p><ul><li>The new mini turnable</li><li>The tracks</li><li>The telescopic boom</li><li>The new version of part 2905; part 99773</li><li>And 2 black versions of part 87082</li></ul>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not great, but good enough. Of course it's a small set, so, for it's size it's ok. Not much to tell here...</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is very good. It's functons are:</p><ul><li>Turning the upperstructure</li><li>Lifting&nbsp;the boom up or down</li><li>Lower the rope with a hook</li><li>Extend the boom</li></ul><p>There is one thing I think is a bit unnecessary: there is a gear to turn the upperstructure, but it's much easier to do it just with your hand. I know this is to let it have more funtions, but still it's a bit unnecessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raising and lowering the boom goes very smoothly.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a very good set. E<span class=""hps"">specially the parts. It has also a good playability, but it can be a bit unstable sometimes. I can really recommend this set.</span></p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
