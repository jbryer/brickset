"Legoless","2011-12-26T13:23:45.81Z","This is the model I could never build 30 years ago","<p>Once again, thanks to <em>Argos</em> and their system glitch that allowed me to get my hands on this and the Tie Fighter (9492), before, i'm sure, I was supposed to.</p>
<h4>The Mini Figures</h4>
<p>Two figures here and two (very old) ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jek Porkins (New) </strong>- The unfortunately named, rotund pilot from Episode IV makes his first appearance in a Star Wars set, and is Disappointingly thin. In fact, from now on I shall refer to him as ""Beardy Luke"". One thing to note is the nice detailing on his helmet which differentiates him from Luke (""Beardless Jek""). 
<li><strong>R2-D2 </strong>- Who doesn't own one of these? 
<li><strong>Luke Skywalker </strong>- It's Luke, in a flight suit, and look, he's got a light saber! 
<li><strong>R5-D8 </strong>- No it's not a couple of guesses in the (once) popular boardgame BattleShips. Rather, it's a new Astromech Droid, and&nbsp;how fine&nbsp;he looks too? He's got a different head shape than R2, which makes a nice change I suppose.</li></ul>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>The ship build was in 5 seperate bags and I have to say was one of the most interesting builds&nbsp;I have ever undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The interior framework </strong>- This consisted of all the internal workings of the wing mechanism and the basics of the main cockpit section 
<li><strong>The outer clading </strong>- That's right, most of the X-wings iconic shape is bolted on. The design of the nose and how it attaches to the rest of the model&nbsp;is genius (although it shares a few similarities to 2010s ARC-170 (8088), this model takes it to the next level). All this to get just the tiniest of tapers, that's real attention to detail! 
<li><strong>The Wings </strong>- These are done in opposite pairs and were&nbsp;quite fun to build. Unfortunately, the inside of the engines and the wing markings are stickers (oh the humanity!) 
<li><strong>Moving Wing Mechanism, exhausts and guns </strong>- This is just the finishing touches (including yet more wing stickers on 1x1 bricks of all things - WHY??)</li></ul>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4>
<p>This ship is simply stunning, from every angle, it just looks and feels ""right"". The wing opening mechanism is much improved from the ARC-170 with the wings snapping open instantly&nbsp;with a half turn of the knob at the rear (not movie accurate, but much better than winding for&nbsp;10 seconds). I nearly bought the 2006 X-wing (6212)&nbsp;a month or so ago as it is still available in Toys 'R Us, but i'm so glad I waited. Buy this with the Tie Fighter and recreate the most iconic intergalactic dogfights in cinema history!</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>I loved the new 2012 Tie Fighter and thought that it was good value for money, but this is just off the scale! For Â£49.99, I think you simple can't find a better Star Wars LEGO set out there. Finally I have the model I tried to build again and again out of ordinary LEGO bricks over 30 years ago. It's a shame I never succeeded, just think of the royalties!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"CapnRex101","2012-01-02T08:11:54.807Z","9493 - X-wing Starfighter","<p>The X-wing is one of the classic ships from Star Wars and it has been created in Lego several times&nbsp;previously, this quite simply put, is the best ever X-wing! The Minifigures are all&nbsp;brilliant&nbsp;and the ship itself is so accurate to the films it is almost unbelievable. It has plenty of features, loads of detail and a huge amount of playability, especially if you have set 9492, TIE Fighter. Anyway, I am going to cut to the chase and we will see what all the fuss is about...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nice with the same excellent design as all of the other new Star Wars boxes with the dark blue borders and Darth Maul in combat at the top. The set itself is shown flying through the Death Star trench as three TIE Fighters follow it. There are laser blasts all around and explosions around the ship. The way they have added a sense of speed by making the edges of the wings blurry is genius, and looks amazing on the box. In the far background behind the TIE Fighters you can see a purple nebula. There is a small box which shows how the wings can fold into attack position or closed in the bottom corner and along the side there is a picture of the four Minifigures included in the set. The back of the box shows the features of the set and another picture of the X-wing from different views on a blueprint background like the other new boxes. I like it even more each time I see it!</p><p>The instructions followed the same design as the box and there were no mistakes. I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of useful parts in this set, not least the four white plates which form the shape of the wings. There are also four white engine parts, four red two by four smooth plates and four white six by three wedge pieces. There are lots of slopes in this model which are very useful and quite a few wheel hubs too which are incorporated into the engines. There is a bit of dark red which is a fairly rare colour too, so that could be required for some MOCS. Of course there is the new Astromech head as well which is printed with red highlights for R5-D8 in the Battle of Yavin or more famously R5-D4 from the Sandcrawler scene.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The four Minifigures are all good. <b>R2-D2</b> has been seen a lot before but is a nice figure nonetheless. <b>Luke&nbsp;Skywalker</b>&nbsp;in his Pilot uniform is a great figure, with plenty of detail both on his torso and his helmet. He comes with his blue lightsaber like he does in the most recent AT-AT. The best two figures however are these, <b>R5-D8</b> is accurate to the droid at the Battle of Yavin, and is great for being R5-D4 in Star Wars&nbsp;Episode&nbsp;Four when Uncle Owen buys some droids as well. The best figure by a mile though is <b>Jek Porkins</b>, just to have him in Lego is fantastic as he is probably my favourite pilot attacking the Death Star. His face&nbsp;definitely makes&nbsp;him look a bit fat as he has very pronounced cheeks and a small mouth, his helmet is accurate to the film and he wears the standard Rebel Pilot uniform. He comes with a&nbsp;regular&nbsp;blaster to complete him.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fun but not very long. It took me about&nbsp;forty&nbsp;minutes but did have some excellent moments throughout. I always love how they create the nose of the ship and this version is better than ever so for me that is a big plus. They have also improved the way the wings open, having to turn the knob on the back for about a minute to get the wings fully open is a thing of the past as now it takes just one half turn! The guns look better than ever as well with coils adding some really good detail. They are much longer now as well which is more accurate.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When it is all together, the set looks fantastic. There are plenty of features including an opening cockpit, folding landing gear and of course the ability to open the wings to attack mode or close them for more speed. There is some excellent engine detailing and I like the stripes on the wings. There are two proton torpedoes included as well, one on each side of the vehicle. They do not fire off, but can be removed for launching, it just needs a bit of imagination! Inside the cockpit there is a target screen, similar to the targeting computer in the film, and a nice grey seat for the pilot, better than sitting on bare bricks I suppose!&nbsp;</p><p>You can choose whether to have Luke and R2-D2 or Jek Porkins and R5-D8 man the ship and I glad they included both. There is just one problem, there are a lot of stickers. The stripes on the wings are stickers and if you are thinking that there is a new one by five smooth plate where the stickers go I am sorry to disappoint you but it is actually a one by four plate with a sticker on, and a one by one plate with a sticker. A real shame but it looks decent once you have the stickers on.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I would certainly advise you to purchase this set at the first opportunity. I think it is the best set in this wave and goes very well with the TIE Fighter set as they are in just the right scale with each other. By itself the model looks great too with some lovely bodywork and nice detail all over. It is sturdy too so you can swoosh it about without fear of it breaking or if you prefer it looks fantastic on display as well. As I do not really mind stickers I am not going to count that against it, but bear in mind if you dislike stickers, this set has a lot of them. If you cannot get the set though, buy the Jek Porkins figure from eBay or Bricklink as it is sublime and he is a great character.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 10/10</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Brickmeister1138","2012-02-26T17:32:58.62Z","The Fighter That Killed the Death Star Finally Given Justice","<p>In the Star Wars Universe, the T-65 X-wing is considered to be the most advanced one man starfighter of its day, which one could easily believe by looking at this set.&nbsp;It gets almost everything right, the fuselage is hexagonal, the proportions are right, and the nose does not look pinced like in the last two versions. The ""swap"" feature introduced with the last X-wing set is also used in this one, allowing the model to represent either Red 5 (Luke) with the default decoration, or Jek (Red 6) by adding 4 1x1 white tiles (with red stripe sticker) to the edge of the 4x1 tiles that have the&nbsp;stickers of Luke's 5 Red Stripes.</p>
<p>The fighter would steal the show in this set, but Lego did a very good job with the minifigs as well. The Luke&nbsp;figure is the same one that was included in the last AT-AT set (8129), which is nice since he can be obtained in a smaller (though still expensive) set. He is a vast improvement on the older style&nbsp;pilot&nbsp;Lukes&nbsp;in terms of detailing on the torso and helmet. The other pilot in this set is the ill-fated Jek Tono Porkins, Red Six, a.k.a. ""Piggy"". Jek was one of the many pilots who got killed in the Battle of Yavin, and has less than a minute of screen time, but the Star Wars novels and comics built up his backstory quite nicely. That said, this choice of a second pilot is odd considering Wedge, Biggs or Red Leader would have been more recognizable; but the minifig itself is quite good (new face and detailed helmet printing), however,&nbsp;Jek ""Piggy"" Porkins looks a bit slim as a minifg. The set also includes 2 Astromech Droids, the now-common improved R2-D2 with the grey dome, and a droid that is locked in a three way tie for being Lego's first good R5 astromech. R5-D8 is very well done, and the printing on the flower-pot shaped head is exquisite. This figure will also work extrordinarialy well as a replacement for the poor attempt&nbsp;at an R5 unit back in the Sandcrawler set, especially since R5-D8 and R5-D4 were filmed with the same prop...</p>
<p>The build is a little complicated, but it is not difficult for most Lego Fans.&nbsp;A kid may need a bit of help with the S-Foil assembly though. There are&nbsp;no really new&nbsp;parts in this set (the R5 Head being the main exception), but they are not needed in the least.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The detailing is excellent 
<li>The minifigs are well printed and authentically detailed (except for Jek's slim Torso) 
<li>The X-Wing can be either Red 5 or Red 6 
<li>Lego finally made a good R5 
<li>The S-foils deploy quickly and easily, no more tedious knob turning 
<li>â¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Price is high 
<li>Jek is thin 
<li>â¦</li></ul>
<p>This set is the best version of the X-wing Lego has made to date. The detail is right, the minifigs are great, and the set, while a bit of a complicated build, would be quite fun for a kid to play with. This set is good for FOLs of all ages, and is a must have for any Lego Star Wars Fan. </p>
<p>Overall, as an AFOL Star Wars nut, I would give this set a 10/10, but it is a bit pricey so my final score is 9.7/10: A Must buy for Lego Star Wars Fans.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 72 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 560 pieces and it is 60 USD. That means that the price per piece ratio is 11 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with 4 minifigs. One of them is R2-D2 who isn't a very special minifig. The other figure we get is a new version of Luke Skywalker in his pilot uniform. He has much better markings on his helmet now and he also has his lightsaber. One of the new minifigs we get here is the R5-D8 figure which comes with a new head mould.

(some what of a bummer for me) but i think that to make it sit what i would consider correctly it would ruin the scale and detail of the ship. the other thing that i do not like is the rubber bands hanging off the back. i am going to try and move them forward to hide them. other than that i love the scale and the detail. i am not sure how it compares to the large x wing that lego put out a number of years ago but this one is a keeper. i also like the way some elements are installed upside down. way cool over all i would give this set a 9.5 out of 10.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

"Chills","2012-08-28T13:32:07.96Z","Lock S-Foils in attack position...","<p>Being a big fan of Imperial ships and sets I am sometimes lacking in my Rebel ship sets, so I had high hopes grabbing the X-Wing earlier this year and I was not disappointed. This is really a wonderful set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The iconic X-Wing is ""Luke's ship"" and is one of the most identifiable models in the SW universe. This LEGO set does a great job of replicating the fighter with bricks. The S-Foils open and close, the laser cannons are accurate, the cockpit is set back near the engines which are also detailed and movie accurate. The overall shape is just like in the movies. I bet the designers had a great time putting this ship together.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The build was a lot of fun. It was straight-forward, but you can see a lot of creative elements and building techniques the designers used. The use of upside-down pieces locked in to give the ship it's symmetrical&nbsp; shape was clever. I also like the use of the colors in the set; the dark red squadron colors are well done, and I also like how bright colors (blue and green) are used in the fuselage.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The minifigures are great! Sure, Jek Porkins could be a little heftier, but he's finally a minifigure along with his droid. And you get a cool Luke figure, too, which is obligatory for an X-Wing set.</li><li>Pro 4: Playability... this set is swooshable and can do battle with all the TIEs LEGO has out there. It's got proton torpedoes (thankfully NO flick missiles), retractable landing gear (in the nose), and of course S-foils that lock in attack position.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1:&nbsp; It's hard to find a con on this set, but one thing I would do differently is make the nose longer. They are called ""snub fighters"" but they don't have snub noses. It should be at least 4 studs longer.<br></li><li>Con 2: Stickers. There are a few to put on the wings. Not too many, and not too difficult to put on like the ones on Plo Koon's fighter... but there are stickers.<br></li></ul>
<p>I don't have any other X-Wing sets so I can't comment on how close to the movie models they are, or how the builds are for them, but this version is really great. It brings you back to the scenes of Luke doing battle against the TIEs, or flying through the clouds of Bespin, or crashing into the swamps of Dagobah. LEGO did well with this set, and it's a lot of fun to build, too.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

"zipsforbananas","2012-07-05T17:58:19.33Z","Almost the definitive X-Wing.  Beautiful but flawed.","<p>
	I didn&#39;t see the fuss when this series of sets was released, the TIE fighter looked so out of scale, and this set didn&#39;t seem all that different to the previous version. I still think the TIE is far too big, but I&#39;m happy to forgive it as it&#39;s just so good in every other way. And I have warmed to this X-Wing, it is a vast improvement, but sadly it&#39;s developed it&#39;s own problems.</p>
<p>
	On the plus side, the figures are fantastic, and overall it is so much more sleek.</p>
<p>
	Luke and R2 are wonderfully detailed, although we&#39;ve seen them before. Jek though is marvellous, and what can I say about the new astromech! A conical head?! I&#39;m geeking out!!</p>
<p>
	On the ship, at the back, there are smooth lines down the back of the ship and actual greebles for R2 to tend. And the pillar pieces at both ends that are brilliantly attached half upside-down give the ship a wonderful shape.</p>
<p>
	At the front the new 10 long slope pieces on the side, a fatter end to the tapering, and a flat top (which I initially didn&#39;t like but now do) make it smooth all the way down.</p>
<p>
	The wings are rendered far, far better, and are upside-down on the underside (why they couldn&#39;t have done that with the last one I don&#39;t know, they&#39;ve always been bolted on with Technic!). And the mechanism is brilliant too, with just a half turn required now. The engines and guns are the biggest step up with decent length guns, stickered vents and proper exhausts.</p>
<p>
	However there are big problems.</p>
<p>
	The nose cone is mystifyingly unattached, in that if you tried to pick the set up by it it would simply come off. (Okay, you probably wouldn&#39;t want to, but it&#39;s the principle of the thing!) It just takes a few extra washers, which mercifully you get as spares anyway, and switching the 2x2 and 2x4 flats on top to tether it (I bought a white 2x2 to solve the colour problem).</p>
<p>
	The wings have quite a few problems too. The 3x6 slopes look clumsy with the gaps between them and the engines. These can be filled fairly well with 1x1 slopes. The joints are strangely untended too, with 1x1 flats needed on the front hinges, and on the underside, where the top had unbroken, smooth lines, the 1x2 flats on the pillars could do with being 1x3 to cover the hinges. These can all be solved with extra bricks, but extra bricks do cost...</p>
<p>
	Worse than that though, the connections and stresses are off. The exhausts are great, but are only attached by a simple Technic connector and are not attached to the engines. And the bottom two take the weight of the model so get pushed off straight with such little support. The fatal flaw is that the hinges constantly pull away from the rest of the wings - open them out and close them once and you&#39;ll see gaps appearing as the wings slowly come away. They&#39;re awfully fiddly to fix too. Classic Technic-not-quite-working-in-a-Lego-set stuff with the Technic joints needing Technic-scale reinforcing. Shame!</p>
<p>
	(I must also share, I&#39;ve spotted a few mistakes in the instructions too! On page 8, the 3 long Technic shaft is in the green 1x2 bricks the panel before it&#39;s added. And on p45 the cockpit screen is just lines, no rendering. I love spotting typos. I know, I&#39;m sad!)</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		So much sleeker!</li>
	<li>
		Sleeker! It&#39;s that much that I&#39;ve made it two points!</li>
	<li>
		A good number of new pieces (1x10 curves, 4x4 plates, with a 2x2 hole or corner missing)</li>
	<li>
		Much better detailing, particularly on the wings</li>
	<li>
		Great figures, especially R5-D8</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Loose nose-cone</li>
	<li>
		Clumsy-looking 3x6 slopes seemingly just dumped beside the engines</li>
	<li>
		Poor attachment on the wing hinges that makes them start to come away</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Overall it&#39;s a great model, but the problems make it sadly flawed to my mind. In fairness, all but the wing-loosening are fixable, but it&#39;s a pity Lego left them needing fixing. I&#39;m not sure how the wings could be more secure without them becoming bulkier either, and they only start to separate, they don&#39;t actually fall off!! I love it, and would recommend it, but will always be a little disappointed by the flaws.</p>

"Lord_Kun","2013-02-02T09:41:59.993Z","My ticket back to Lego after years... and an amazing one!","This set will ever have a special place for me, as it represents my first
 birthday gift of my Alessandra (yes, I write from Italy) and I'll 
always remember the incredible sensation of hearing bricks falling one on 
the other when I raise up the package... It had the power to bring me 
back far over one decade of my life, directly before the computer's 
screen sucked me in, when all my fantasies became real thanks to Lego constructions.<br>And
 so here I am, I feel really compelled to write this review, 
hoping that others might find it useful, even if this set it's been out 
for more than an year now.<br><br>The <b>building experience </b>was great, so great that I've already 
rebuilt it other two times, every time picking a different starting point in 
the instructions. The reason for it it's also the one why there's a 
missing brick in my rating: four wings looking the same, even 
considering the difference each two of them for the direction, are quite
 boring to put together<b>.<br></b>Yes, it's the base concept of this starfighter, but I founded the right amount of 
satisfaction by switching the building of the wings between the other 
parts, aided by the fact that I always made one, huge pile of all the pieces prior the beginning (and I'm sure I'm not the only one that 
doesn't use at all the numbered bags, even if they are a good idea for 
youngsters). <br>This said, you'll love how the build came together, beginning with the Technic gears to open the wings, to the construction of the convergent nose, by far my satisficting part, for the cunning solution they applied. No fear of the striking coloured bricks, they are all going to be covered in the end!<br><br>The <b>parts </b>are the real strength of this set, as there are a lot of special ones for all the purpose of building a collector item that it also possible to play with. The cockpit glass is just the right one as the engines, but what I like most are the laser cannons. And I found that just by looking at them, even on the pictures on the box: if you want your Lego X Wing, you have to buy this 2012 set. Have you seen how short and bad made they look in the previous ones?<br>I found no review pointing this out loudly, but I insist in it because that's one part of the original X Wing that I always found remarkable: ""These Laser Cannons are huge!"", I've always said to myself while watching the movies. And, finally, we have a set where they really are huge, long and sleek, just by chosing the right pieces.<br><br>As for the stickers, it was my first time facing them and it went quite easy (even it was 2.00 am), the only ones that could give troubles are the four circular front of the engines, those really had to be printed, and maybe the solution for going from Red Five to Red Six could be resolved by adding a longer smooth piece and a totally new sticker (I don't quite like the look of the 1x1 next to the standard 5x1), but these are really small complains and I don't feel to subtract a rate, comparing the greatness of all the other parts.<br>Sorry for the Minifigures estimators, but this is not the review for you: I love how the minifigures in this set are made and painted, I want to be clear, but they are just what you had to fit inside the beautiful Starfighter you are going to build. The best satisfaction I had from them was seeing how much good the proportions were respected.<br><br><b>Playing </b>with this set is immediate and really satisfactory, you can grab it by the rear, between the wings (the smooth and long white bricks are just there to be touched by your fingers) and the starfighter rises in the air with ease. I've quite a reputation in crashing Lego starships (you can call me Launchpad Kun) and I could say this set it's really sturdy, a feature long sought by anyone, I know, in every set. <br>You can swoosh it, looping and tilting the Starfighter at will, without worrying about pieces falling over: of course the cannons are the most fragile parts, but that's also in the original one, being on the edge of the wings as they are. Thanks to Lego, you'll have some replacements for the gear piece that takes all together, the only part that ever fell off so far in my experience. <br>Pity for the missing space for the equipment, but my girl found that the large and white triangular pieces are just perfect to store things.<br><br>There are just two complains about playability and both are related to the same part of the X Wing: the landing gear. And I'm sorry to take a rate off for this, but I think it could be a real improvement.<br>I'm talking firstly about the existing one: it goes up and down real good, but in flight mode it doesn't precisely fit inside the nose, a feature that the new A-Wing (and yes, I've purchased it after my Lego mania returned) beatifully accomplish. <br>The second one is more pratical and important: without two rear landing gears, you have the ending and upper part of the engines of the lower wings that remained a bit under the landing line, resulting in a progressive bending of them, as they are connected just by a little Technic piece. Up to the present, no problem at all, you could easily made them straight with a little pressure, but I'm a bit concerned for the future...<br><br>And, last but non least and specifically not to throw a gloomy aura, I really want to mention the way Lego found to open the wings, because it's pure perfection for me. I know that's faster than the movies, but it's the sensation it gives what matters and, for me, it's like a metamorphosis: if you had any doubt about what have you in your hands, what have you built, it immediately falls off the first time you open the wings and the Star Wars's X Wing come into being, with all its right proportions and shapes... just try to catch Luke's eyes watching sideways between two laser cannons in attack mode and I'm sure you'll be satisfied.<br><br>The <b>value for money </b>wasn't a problem for me, as this was received as a gift, but of course I've seen how much does this set cost and, as usual for Lego, it's too much.<br>The result it's a big spaceship and the set is totally worthy, but there is the usual problem of the box totally out of proportion for what it has inside and in general the price is high, the ideal should be around a minimum of 10$ less, to a total of between 40-45â¬ for us Europeans.<br><br><b>Overall</b>, it has some functions and part that could be improved and I have tried to be more honest that I could in this review, but the 9493 Lego set IT IS the X Wing out of Lego bricks and I love to have it and to play with it, not to mention how much it's been showed to anyone happens to be in my house... so, for me, maximum rating guaranteed!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,3

<p>And boy, does it show how things have changed.</p>

<p>Compared to that original, this is definitely the larger model, with more detail on this one than before.&nbsp; Unlike it&#39;s 1999 counter-part, it also has a mechanism for opening/closing the wings, rather than the manual intervention (toothed bricks) that was previously required.&nbsp; The wings seem larger and more in scale, while the engines more in tune with what was shown but (unfortunately, IMO), this also uses stickers for the engine intakes - I hate stickers :(</p>

<p>This model has a front landing gear that folds up in the nose (rather than the previous remove and forget), but has no back landing gear, resting on the bottom engines instead.</p>

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2013-05-23T23:16:40.367Z","Perfect X-Wing Model","<p>Anytime LEGO releases a new X-wing, my interest is immediately piqued. As an owner of most of the models in the recent past, as well as several other starfighters, I can say the improvement to this particular model over its predecessor (6212) is absolutely incredible. This model is a must have for any self-respecting LEGO Star Wars collector.</p><p>First off, I'd like to start with what was, in my opinion, the only odd part of the set: the minifigures. You've got the ever-standard Luke and R2-D2 combo as the movies would dictate, but as with previous models, an additional pilot from Red/Rogue Squadron is included. In the first model Biggs Darklighter was included (a natural choice given his connection to Luke) and the previous model to this included Wedge Antilles (also a natural choice given appearances in all three movies; was a surprise he wasn't included sooner). But this model, instead of perhaps updating and giving one of those famous pilots, went off the wall. We got Jek Porkins. The official Star Wars Wiki is very generous on its depiction of ""Piggy"" (thanks to the Expanded Universe fill-ins) but most fans know him as the first Rebel pilot to go in the Death Star run. Up until I stopped laughing they included this guy, I realized he got more detail than Wedge or Biggs ever did. So the figures could have been better as a whole.</p><p>The model, however, is the part that deserves the praise of the set rather than the odd minifigure choice. The wing configuration has been overhauled, and the end result is a double-banded gear mechanism that opens with a single turn of the knob rather than multiple twists that 6212 required. The wings are also more securely attached and don't fall apart as easily. The cockpit is more detailed, including a command chair and more detailed targeting computer. The outer details are much more obvious in comparison to past models, such as the laser cannons and wing details. Despite the lack of a storage under the fighter in past models, the lack of it in this model leads to a higher ""swoosh"" factor in the fighter. The back of the seat has a slightly open area to store the accessories in, but this however is not completely perfect.</p><p>To conclude, this fighter is a vast improvement upon its predecessors, dispite its less than superb minifigure selection in regards to the most significant of Rebel pilots (and the odd advertising on the box -- Porkins storming an Imperial facility seems odd) but this set should be at the top of any Star Wars collector's list.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

Get it if it's on sale.","First, let's start with a bit of backstory.&nbsp; I got the X-Wing sets from 1999 and 2004, and while both of them were okay, they both had their problems.&nbsp; One was too small, one was missing a lot of details.&nbsp; I didn't get the 2006 version, but it looks exactly like the 2004 one, minus Yoda.<br><br>This X-Wing soared past those ones, blasted them to space dust, and then did a barrel roll just for fun.&nbsp; On the old ones, the wings were too weak, opened too slowly, and the 2004/6 one was missing the slope up to the engines.&nbsp; The guns were too short, the little T things were missing from the engines, the back end looked ugly, the back part of the thrusters was all wrong, and the nose was too skinny.&nbsp; This one fixed every one of those problems.<br><br>That said, I'm not entirely happy with the new X-Wing.&nbsp; The engines and wings have too much space between them, and the landing gear doesn't work very well.&nbsp; I understand though, as there needed to be room for the mechanism, and ..again, there needed to be room for the mechanism.&nbsp; I've found standing the model on the back of the engines (so it's vertical) makes it easier to display.&nbsp; Also, the price here in Canada was about $25 more than it should have been.<br><br>However, the improvements far outweigh the problems.&nbsp; The shape of the body is essentially perfect, and the nose narrowing only to three studs rather than two (before the nose cone) really makes the whole thing more sleek and smooth.&nbsp; It has missiles that fire, but no ridiculous flick-fire contraption.&nbsp; Flick fire is stupid.&nbsp; (Though if I may take a moment to predict the future, something worse is coming: spring-loaded missiles)&nbsp; Normal missiles, like this has, are good.<br>The wings are attached very well, and I've had no problems with them coming off or anything.&nbsp; The blasters and engines are nicely detailed, and look way better than the lousy ones we've gotten before.&nbsp; And the best part about the wings was the improved opening mechanism.&nbsp; That's why I'm so forgiving of the wings and engines not being as close together as they should: the mechanism is superb.&nbsp; Where it used to be ""Lock S-Foils in attack position.""&nbsp; ""Okay, gimme a minute...&nbsp; Hold on..&nbsp; Almost there...&nbsp; ...Almost there....""&nbsp; Now it's ""Attack position.""&nbsp; ""Done.""<br>The back of the main body looks way better too.&nbsp; As in, there's more than zero details on it, and what's there looks like it actually is something, and as an added bonus, it looks like what's in the movie version.<br><br>The minifigures in this set are great.&nbsp; Luke and R2 are kinda.. yeah, whatever, I've got a dozen of 'em already.&nbsp; But I get why an X-Wing set should have them.&nbsp; However, the Jek Porkins minifig was pretty much the selling point for me.&nbsp; I wish as much detail had been put into the Wedge Antilles minifig back in 2006.&nbsp; Porkins gets a lot of hate, some even going as far as to give him insulting nicknames like ""Piggy"", but I say he's awesome!&nbsp; When I was building the set, I tossed Luke and R2 aside, because this pride of my fighter squadron was going to belong to none other than Porkins!&nbsp; Also, the extra parts they included to make it Red 6 instead of 5 was a nice touch.<br><br>As a model, it was fun to build.&nbsp; Stickers were annoying as always, but there weren't too many.&nbsp; As I was putting it together, I had a great many moments of ""Aww, cool!""&nbsp; ""Yes, they finally made that work right!""&nbsp; ""Thank you for being smart with this one, Lego.""&nbsp; I hear a lot of complaints about repetition, and to that I say..&nbsp; If it gets boring building four X-Wing wings, then A: You don't like X-Wings enough.&nbsp; And B: Build all four at the same time.<br><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Porkins and his droid. +1<br></li><li>Wings open quickly. +1<br></li><li>Incredible details. +1<br></li><li>No flick-fire missiles. +1/2</li><li>Fun to build.&nbsp; +1/2<br></li><li>Fixed many of the problems earlier models had. +1<br></li><li>Very sturdy. +1<br></li><li>Great to play with. +1<br></li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive. -1/2&nbsp; (If you get it on sale, or in the US, not so bad.)<br></li><li>No rear landing gear. -1/2 (Sits nicely on its back though.)<br></li><li>Wings and engines have too much space between them. -1/2 (Acceptable because the wings open so well.)<br></li><li>Astromech socket is sideways. -1/2&nbsp; (The other options are make the body wider and mess up the model, or have R2's shoulders sticking out too much.&nbsp; Close enough.)</li></ul><h4>Total Score:&nbsp; 5/5&nbsp; A brilliant model!<br></h4>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

Released in 2012 at a value of $59.99, this was my first STAR WARS set. Although it may not be the most screen-accurate, this is one of the most fantastic, playable, and purchase-worthy sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The X-Wing Starfighter includes two minifigures and two droid figures. The Jek Porkins&nbsp;minifigure has a single-sided face with a printed visor, along with a standard issue blaster pistol element as an accessory. The Luke Skywalker minifigure has an iconic Red Five pilot helmet and a single-sided face, along with a lightsaber as an accessory. The two droids are fantastic, and both fit easily into the provided slot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The X-Wing itself has a beautiful, sleek body. It is stable in all points, but I do not recommend lifting it by the nose cone, as it is detachable, and not firmly connected. The cockpit provides a seat for either pilot minifigure, and has a dark green seat element and a stickered targetting screen. The droid slot, slightly farther back, fits either droid, depending on which pilot you use. There are missiles on the base of the cockpit, although they are not flick missiles or stud-shooters, since stud-shooters were not created yet. On the back of the set, there is technic gear that can switch the s-foils from cruise mode to attack mode. The wings themselves have the option to switch between the Red 5 stickers and Red 6 stickers, based on the pilot. There is landing gear for the model when it is in landed mode as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I find nothing negative about this X-Wing set. An important part of my childhood, this X-Wing contains a perfect minifigure selection, plenty of play features, and is the perfect set for STAR WARS fans, adults and children alike.</p>
