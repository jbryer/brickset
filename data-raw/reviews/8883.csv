"CapnRex101","2011-12-28T18:05:20.907Z","9488 - Elite Clone Trooper and Commando Droid Battle Pack","<p>This is in my opinion the greatest battle pack ever! None of the others come close to the sheer quality and playability of this set. It will come as no surprise that the ARC Trooper is the highlight of the set and one of the best Lego Minifigures in my collection, the detail is almost beyond&nbsp;comprehension. The other three figures are also brilliant, in particular the two Commando Droids which I have been after for a while in Lego. Even the cannon is decent, a rare&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;for this type of set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is brand new and I love it! The bordering has changed with the old Rex picture gone and a magnificent new shot of Darth Maul in an action pose now glaring down at the set. The Star Wars logo has also been changed, written in blue with a white border. All in all the border looks brilliant. The set image itself shows the cannon (driven by the ARF trooper) surrounded by the other three figures with laser blasts and explosions flying everywhere. The background appears to be Geonosis which is an odd choice as the two clones at least appeared on Kamino, and there were probably some Commando Droids running around! The flick fire missile is flying through the air to finish off the box front. The back shows the features and a sort of blueprints section which has pictures of the cannon at different angles, which looks great.</p><p>The instructions have a very similar design to the box and are fine with no mistakes. I had no missing pieces (happy days).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are quite a few interesting new parts in this set, of course there are the new helmet, Pauldron and Kama which are lovely, but there is also the new Commando Droid head which is a delight as well. There are five of the fairly new three stud long flat tiles in light grey which are very useful for making your own creations I have found. There are a couple of gold cones and a light grey pillar piece too!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This is the best bit of course. All four of the figures are brand new and as I&nbsp;previously&nbsp;mentioned all are fantastic.&nbsp;</p><p>We will start with the worst of them (although he is great) the <b>Kamino ARF Trooper</b>. He is quite basic with a standard clone torso with dark red arms, and average Clone Trooper legs. He has a normal clone head and a regular black rifle. So what exactly is special about this guy? The helmet, that's what! I have almost never seen a more wonderful printed piece. The mould is the same of the older ARF trooper figure from last year, but printed with a different design, there are red stripes and patterns all over the piece and it certainly makes him look unique. In case anyone is wondering, clones with this armour appeared briefly in the Kamino episodes of the Clone Wars at the start of Season 3, three of them can be seen running along a corridor before one of them kneels down to fire a rocket launcher.</p><p>The <b>Commando Droids</b> are a sight to behold. I for one have been desperate to get my hands on these guys in Lego since we first saw them in Season 1. Lego's attempt does not disappoint! The legs are that of a Super Battle Droid or Tactical Droid but in brown and the torso and arms belong to regular Battle Droids but in brown also. On the torso a small red dot is printed just like they have in the show. They each carry the same blaster as most other Battle Droids and Clones. The head is the really special bit of this Minifigure though, it is sublimely&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;with light grey highlights and two penetrating white eyes. Incredibly accurate to what we see in the TV show. To sweeten the deal we get a pair of these terrifying Droids to add to our army.</p><p>The <b>ARC Trooper</b> is, simply put, one of the best figures Lego have ever created. There is no fault whatsoever and it is absolutely smothered with gorgeous details which just bring this figure into a league of its own. I will start at the bottom. The legs are printed with a similar design to the Bomb Squad Troopers and Horn Company Troopers from the last Clone Battle Pack, but this time on dark red legs. Even the feet are printed with Clone boots which is a lovely touch. Next comes the new fabric Kama which is nice and a huge step up from the older hard plastic ones. This one is black which is lucky as it can also be used for Captain Rex if you want to upgrade him a little. It allows the figures to sit down easily and means the legs can be put in a running pose. The torso is excellent, it perfectly represents the ARC Troopers seen in the show right down to the ammo pouch and four red spots on the breastplate. The Pauldron is also made from a cloth material in dark red, it is not&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;accurate but looks amazing nevertheless. He includes a brick-built backpack which is quite nice and fits well behind his back without interfering with the Pauldron at all. The head is the same as that of most of the other Clone Troopers. The helmet though, as with the ARF Trooper, is where the Minifigure really comes to life. It is a fantastic mould with grey and black and red printing providing as much detail as could possibly be needed. He inlcudes a set of four rangefinders and four visors in dark red, the visors go great in Commander Fox and I have found very useful.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is short, abut five minutes, it almost takes longer to&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;attach the fabric pieces than to build the cannon. I do like the use of ratchet joints to form the legs and the way the feet are design but apart from that there is little of real interest.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As a set the model is very nice, there is all you need for a rather one sided battle unlike the old Battle Packs and I quite like the new direction they are going in personally. The cannon has one feature and that is to fire a gold tipped flick-fire missile from beneath the gun barrel, not a bad feature for a child I suppose but a bit boring for anyone else. I am actually very surprised at what a good&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of an AV-7 Antivehicle Cannon the gun emplacement is, sure it is far too small, but nevertheless it gets the key look of the cannon into the design with ease. Inexplicably there is a translucent&nbsp;cylinder&nbsp;piece supporting the cannon from below which is not really needed as the cannon stands well on its four legs as it is! On the left side of the cannon (when it is facing you) there is a black seat for a figure to drive the cannon, finally a place for all those gunners to go!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Buy this set when you see it is the main message I have for you, the cannon is nice, the figures are even nicer! What is not to like? The price is reasonable in my opinion, it would be nicer to see it stay at the ten pound price point here in the UK, but you can't have it all. Of course my rating is...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Paradoxymoron","2012-01-28T17:44:19.747Z","Best Battle Pack By Far","<p>Found this at TRU along with other SW sets. Of course the price was higher than normal ($15) however I have two coupons that I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">had </span>to use. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has the usual info and picture portraying the set in an action pose. As I'm sure you know, the SW Banner now includes Darth Maul, with his angry face peering at some unseen foe. The back of the box shows the cannon again from a few more angles, as well as the set's ""play features"".</p><p>The instructions were clear, with no misprints or missing pages. I was glad to see that they squeezed the parts list onto the same page as the last step (kind of- it starts on that page, while the majority is the next page). There is also a small comic at the back, in which our Hero the ARC Trooper (and I guess his companion the ARF Trooper) chase off the Droids with their cannon.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts outside those used on the minifigs are standard. I found it interesting not only that the new (fabric) kama and pauldron were in their own cardboard container, but also that four (!) dark red antenna/rangefinders and four (!) clone visors (again, dark red) were included in their own separate bag. I was intrigued by this, as only one rangefinder is used, and none of the visors are. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The ARF Trooper is essentially the same as he was last year. The only major difference is his dark red arms. And also, he has some absolutely <span style=""font-style: italic;"">awesome </span>printing on his helmet. Aside from the standard Clone Trooper printing on his torso and head, nothing else special about him. <br></p><p>The Commando Droids are something that I have been waiting for in LEGO form since the airing of the episode ""Rookies"". They are built out of Super Battle Droid legs, with a Battle Droid body and arms, and a new head. the head is beautiful, and captures not only the droids' heads themselves, but also the way they hold the heads. All in all, they are pretty good. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">However. </span>I have two minor gripes. The first is that the Super Battle Droid legs (which are longer than regular Battle Droid legs) look oddly out of proportion compared to the body. The second is that they are not black (like they were in the show) but a dark brown. <br></p><p>And finally, the minifig that everyone will be after this set for... The ARC Trooper. Let's start with his least interesting feature: his head. He has the standard Clone Trooper head which I believe everyone is thoroughly sick of by now. Next, his helmet is a brilliant mix of the Phase I and Phase II helmet designs. I was delighted to see that the helmet is not lowered at the front, meaning he can turn his head (unlike his Episode III brethren). The helmet is, like his ARF companion, printed brilliantly. On his helmet is the rangefinder which we are all used to now, except it is now in dark red. He wears a small backpack made up of a few parts, and while it is not very exciting, it is an interesting design and adds to the character. The new pauldron and kama are great, and do not hinder the movement of the arms or legs, as previous attempts did. The torso printing is nice, and makes the torso stand out from the other clones due to it's large grey vest thing. There is also back printing, though this is not visible due to his backpack. His legs are dark red, and have great printing. Unfortunately, the red shows through the printing ever so slightly, so the white on the printing is now as bright as the white pieces which make up the torso.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is, as one would expect from a Battle Pack, not very challenging or entertaining. Despite this, I was shocked to see the use of SNOT techniques here. I haven't seen them use these in Battle Packs since 2007. There were also a few instances where I was curious as to why two pieces were used when one would have been sufficient.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Really all this set is a small cannon and the minifigs. Don't get me wrong, the cannon is cool, and the minifigs are great, but there is not really even a balance of power here. 9489 has a base for the rebels and a speeder for the Imperials, while this has a cannon for the Clones and... nothing for the droids. At the same time, this set has more pieces, and the cannon is a bit more exciting than 9489... <br></p><p>I was a bit puzzled at the inclusion of the clear piece below the cannon. It isn't really needed. The cannon stands fine on it's own. I am rather fond of the technic axle used to fire the flick missile though. Between the flick missile, the movable legs, and some baddies, this set definitely possesses some playability. <br></p><p>I can't remember for sure whether or not these cannons have appeared in the show, but I think that if they were, they have been grossly undersized in this set. <br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>While I did have a few minor complaints, this set is actually pure excellence. It is, in my opinion, the best Battle Pack yet. On top of that, the ARC Trooper is worth every penny of this set on his own. I would highly recommend this, especially over 9489.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"Niallskie","2012-01-21T04:04:35.52Z","Blasting them Droids...","<p>Got these set at our local Fred Meyer, and for an awesome deal of buy 2 take 1. Too bad when I got there they only have two of these set, so I have to get Mandalorian Battle Pack (7914) as it's the only battle pack available on the store. I'm a bit disappointed of the dollar increase, as the Star Wars Battle packs price is increasing yearly, now $12.99. What more if I got these from TRU, im sure it will be around $15-$16...OUCH. Don't know if its because of the brick count, which on this set is at 98pcs., yet the Endor Rebel Trooper Pack (9489) is just around 77... so I guess it might&nbsp;not be&nbsp;the brick count?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the set review, box image is awesome and it does basically tell you what to expect from the set. Specially at the back, gives you an abundant of pictures, specially the cannon itself. I'm sure the higlight of these set is the Elite Clone Troopers minifigures&nbsp;first, then the cannon second. Lets talk about the Arc Trooper first... this minifigure is AWESOME, from the helmet to the torso print, then the leg print is just fantastic. The skirt (dont know what its called LOL) are a great addition, better than what they were using before, im talking about the solid plastic one for the clone commanders that make it impossible for the minifigure to move its foot forward, what more to sit down. It lessens the playability of the minifigure. The shoulder skirt (again dont know what its called) is nice, give it more character. Then the backpack, simple yet&nbsp;it gives the minifigure a better look.&nbsp;Guns are perfect for the Arc Trooper, not too big and not too heavy. I dont know why SW&nbsp;blasters is kinda too big? This size is perfect I think, so hope the lego guys do this adjustment on the SW blasters. I just love the Helmet on this Arc Trooper, color combination is magnificent. On this set there is a bunch of extra helmet gadgets in which the antena was the only gadget you will use when you follow the intructions... but who is arguing, any extra pieces is a plus. The Cannon gunner is cool as well, though torso print and legs are basically old parts of the SW set. A little extra color would have made it better, like the green color added in one of the minifigures in the Clone Battle Pack last year. Helmet was also the same in the said minifigure, but different print design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannon looks devastating, with or without the flick missile below the main cannon barrel. Yet its there for additional playability, so it does serve its purpose. The build of the Cannon is unconventional in my opinion, but effective. Makes the building process very interesting and not a boring build. Would have been nice if the actual upper cannon swings from side to side. Even the cannon legs looks unconventional, yet it gives cannon an awesome look. Cannon legs also looks like it can walk when the cannon want to be moved (I dont know if there is an actual cannon like this in the SW shows). All in all this cannon rocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Droids are so so for me, though they are new in color it just don't dont cut it for me. If you dont have a minifigure stand like the one used for the collectible minifigure or your not playing on a lego plates, you have to make them lean back a bit because the blaster is too heavy and will make them fall forward. Then again this set will not be a battle pack without 4 minifigures so that's that. All in all this battle pack is superb and I will not hesitate to get more of these. Arc Trooper alone made buying this set a must...</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Huge_Nerd","2012-02-27T20:32:00Z","An elite battle pack!","This battle pack has received a lot of hype and I believe it lives up to it.<br><br>The ARC trooper is amazing with his front, back, leg, and even toe printing. His cloth pieces are nice, but the waist/leg sloth is a little&nbsp; more difficult to put on due to the hip pegs being shorter than the neck peg.&nbsp; The little backpack is simple, yet&nbsp; effective. It looks like it a communications pack or something like that.<br><br>The ARF trooper's best attribute is his helmet--it even bests the Arc troopers's helmet when it comes to printed detail. The wolf symbols are especially nice.&nbsp; I think this helmet may even be better than my favorite helmet to this point, the AT-AT driver helmet from a couple years back.&nbsp; <br><br>The droid commandos are nice change of pace from the usual battle droids. I think it was clever using the super battle droid legs to give them some extra height--they're nice and tall.&nbsp; The new heads are nicely painted and the brown color helps them stand out. Overall they make good opponents for the clones.&nbsp; I think I like having both factions in one pack.<br><br>The model itself is very nice for what it is. It does a good job of being a scaled down version of the AV-7 anti-vehicle cannon--it's always nice when a battle pack vehicle is canon (pun intended!)&nbsp; The build was surprisingly interesting and the piece selection, while not too unique, had some pieces in some rarer colors. I especially like the gold conical pieces.<br><br>In conclusion, this is a great battle pack and well worth the price.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"BrickPro555","2012-02-22T23:01:50.27Z","Get This Battle Pack!","<p>This is a great set! It is a dollar more than the last battle packs, but it is totally worth it. I love the elite clone trooper, it&#39;s why you get the set. The new cloth poldrin and waist cape is awesome. The trooper has a 1.5 clone helment,meaning that the helment is a cross of a phase 2 helment and a phase 1 helments.It does have back printing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The next minifigure is the new scout trooper. The figure has a regular clone torso except for the dark red arms. I found that the visor is actually different from the scout trooper visor in the Clone Trooper Battle Pack! He also comes with a blaster rifle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The last 2 figures are the new commando droids. They have a redish brown body and also have super battle droid legs. The heads are very small and need to be pointed at a different angle. The droids come with standard guns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The cannon itself is awesome. It can fire a flick fire missile and the legs can move. The cannon can move up and down. It has very nice details. You can put a minifig inthe operater&#39;s seat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This a very nice set. I recomend getting the set at full price. Once again, very nice set.</p>

Choosing over either this or the Endor battle pack, I so far think I might have picked the right set. However, I join those who don't like the new deal with giving us only two clones or two separatists in a set like this. Still, it IS a <i>battle pack</i> so in a way it makes perfect sense.</div><div><br></div><h4>The minifigures.</h4><div><br></div><div>You get some great minifigs in this set, I have to tell you. Highly detailed and you get lots of extra commando gear for the clones. That's a nice touch, especially if you already have a ton of clones that you want to get battle-ready. The collectors' value with these might go sky-rocketing in a few years, so for that reason alone these minifigs can be interesting.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ARF</b>: This is spot on similar to the ARF trooper you get in the recent <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7913-1"">clone trooper battle pack</a>, except for the red colours and markings. The coolest part is, as for the latter, the helmet and a very nice paint-job.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ARC</b>: I think this might be one of the big draws for this set. The ARC-trooper has the same red tone as the ARF and has the most torso and leg markings of the two. He comes with a backpack, shoulder pauldron and leg armour, which all make him slightly immobile. He still look cool enough, though.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Commando droids</b>: The commando droids from the Clone Wars tv-series look are true to the series and has some nice printing on head and torso.</div><div><br></div><h4>Cannon.</h4><div><br></div><div>I am no real fan of this cannon. Still, it's nice to get something else than a speeder everytime there's a battle pack. The cannon uses some interesting pieces and colours in its build, in case you want to use them for something else. As function goes, it does its job fairly well. There's a seat for a clone and flick missile (that shoots well).

Myself, I'm not sure it's the way to go to have a 50/50 pack and really pay more for less clones/separatists considering you get two additional minifigs in previous packs. But that's just me. Some might really disagree and that's just fine. It is a good set, perhaps the best battle pack for 2012 so far.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,3

I just went to my local Target and picked up the new Elite clone Trooper and Commando Droid Battle Pack! Whew, that's a mouthful! But anyway, let's get to the review!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the nomal BP size and now&nbsp;has&nbsp;Darth Maul as the mascott in the top right corner due to Episode I being shown&nbsp;in 3D.</p><p>The instructions where fine and had no bugs.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are good. Only 3 new pieces though, including the Arc Trooper helmet, and the two Commando Droid heads.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are all exlusive to this set and I will review them here:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ARF Trooper:</p><p>The ARF trooper is the same mold as in the previous BP, but with different printing.</p><p>He has a normal Clone&nbsp;torso with Dark Red arms with the normal Clone head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commando Droid:</p><p>The first thing&nbsp;I have to say about these guys is that they are tall, about as tall as a Super Battle Droid. They use the same legs as a SBD in Dark Brown. The new head mold is very cool, with printed eyes and pin-stripes. Thier body akso have a printed Red dot on the right side of their torso.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ARC Trooper:</p><p>The ARC Trooper is the downright coolest SW minifig in production! His helmet is a new mold and includes fapric Shoulder-Pads and Kama Skirt, the same material used on Capes.</p><p>He has awesome printing and a cool Back-Pack that uses 3 pieces. His weapons are dual Pistols with Scopes.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build was acually very fun, for a BP model! The ARC Trooper&nbsp;took 7 steps to build, which is rare for a minifig!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The A. Cannon is perhaps the best BP model I've seen, the designers put alot of thought into it. It is easily recognizable from the SWCW episodes.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This Battle Pack is easily the best BP so far, I hope the future BPs are as good as this one.</p><p>I reccomend this set the SW and&nbsp;SWCW fan af all ages.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"dixondog","2012-03-09T17:17:51.93Z","ok set, not good for the money. ","ok, i will get right to the point: MINIFIGS! these are the best part of this set. to start, ARC trooper, the best minifig in this theme, (other than Boba-fet) &nbsp;HE IS AWSOME! His helmet is a&nbsp;combination&nbsp;of an episode II and episode III helmet. the pauldrins and leg things are made with the same fabric as capes and are much better than the old ones. the ARF trooper is the same as the green one but is much more detailed. the comando droids are not that cool. the cannon is small but really cool and the flick&nbsp;missal&nbsp;works somewhat well.<div><br></div><div>overall a good set but is only worth eight dollars. i would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this to a friend but try to get it on sale.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Snowtrooper119","2012-03-10T03:43:55.627Z","The next generation of battle packs","<p>Battle packs first came out in 2007 with the release of 7654 &amp; 7655. It allowed army builders to build armies cheaply&nbsp;without buying large sets.These battle packs would contain four minifigures along with something made out of bricks that was a bonus if it was cool but didn't matter if it was not. In 2012 LEGO have changed the battle pack formula to include an actual battle, not just one side of the war. While this is good for those who want a battle, army builders are not as lucky with this change. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Minifigures are the only reason someone would buy a battle pack and this set has brilliant minifigures. The commando droids are nice and look cool with their specially molded head and that shade of brown which to my knowledge is unique. The ARF&nbsp;(Advanced recon Trooper)&nbsp;trooper uses the same parts as the one found in 7913 but has&nbsp;dark red arms and&nbsp;dark red printing on the helmet. I really like the&nbsp;added colour&nbsp;and I think that&nbsp;it fits in brilliantly with the ARC trooper. The ARC (Advanced Recon Commando) Trooper is the most detailed minifigure I have, indeed it&nbsp;takes 7 steps in the instruction manual to build it. The mix of&nbsp;updated phase II armour,&nbsp;dark red printing&nbsp;and updated ARC trooper gear makes it a fantastic minifigure. The old arc trooper gear was clunky and dind't allow the wearer to move their legs but that has been scrapped in favour of a fabric (the one used for capes) which allows for leg and arm articulation and looks much better. This minifigure alone is enough reason to get this set.</p>
<h4>AV-7 Anti-vehicle Cannon</h4>
<p>This is a nice little cannon. It looks nice for it's scale and the splashes of dark (or republic)&nbsp;red look really nice against the&nbsp;light bley bricks. it is a simple design but one that works well. The seat fits well and the flick-fire missile almost looks like it belongs as part of the set. All in all this is quite a good vehicle to acompany this battle pack.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This is a really good battle pack that sets the benchmark for all battle packs to come. The minifigures are great and the cannon is a nice addition. I recomend this to fans of Star Wars, awesome minifigures and dark red.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Graysmith","2012-03-25T23:15:52.827Z","Elite vs. Elite","<div>This is the first set I’ve purchased from the Clone Wars subtheme, and I have to say I’m very pleased with it overall. It’s certainly overpriced for what you get (like all battle packs), but the minifigures are great and so is the unfairly unloved cannon.</div><div><br></div><div>I actually love the cannon. I’d even say it’s half the reason I decided to buy the set, compared to most people who I imagine are strictly buying it for the minifigures and are either selling the cannon or using the pieces for scrap. That’s a shame, I think. Personally, I think there’s just something about the design and colours that really work. It’s a simple design compared to the cannons in sets like <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7869-1"">7869</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=9491-1"">9491</a>, for example, but this little cannon still manages to look really great. The only thing I think it should've included is a clip piece so you can attach a weapon next to the gunner's seat. It’s an easy addition if you have such a piece to spare though. I put one of <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=92280"">these clip pieces</a> in black on the two studs beneath the seat and it made a great-looking cannon even better (and more useful).</div><div><br></div><div>As for the minifigures, while I don’t agree with those who proclaim the ARC trooper to be one of the greatest minifigures ever, they are all certainly very nice. The ARC trooper still looks great without the cloth pieces too, which is fortunate for someone like me who doesn’t really care for cloth (unless we're talking about full capes). I also found that both clone troopers looked much better if you switch their legs, i.e. putting the red legs on the red-armed ARF trooper and the white legs on the ARC trooper. The Commando Droids are quite nice too, but obviously pale in comparison to the regular minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the decision to put opposing forces in one pack, I have to say I would’ve much preferred it if they’d done two separate battle packs instead of one. It’d been much nicer if this pack had included two regular clone troopers to go with the two elite troopers, and that there’d been another battle pack with the Commando Droids and two other types of droids. Not only would that have given you a lot more variety (especially if you want to create a big battle scene), it would’ve also helped make the fight a bit more even since the droids don’t get any kind of extra vehicle or cannon in this existing set.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bottom line</b>: Even though I think they should’ve split these into two battle packs, this is still a terrific battle pack. The minifigures are all great, and it comes with an awesome-looking cannon that is probably my favourite battle pack accessory since the 2009 battle packs.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
"Firox_5000","2012-12-13T11:18:44.603Z","Clone Trooper battle version 4 ","This was one of the first 2012 Star Wars set I bought.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The set cost a rather expensive £11.99 which has seen a £2 price rise since the last battle packs. The build took less than 10 minutes to build and provided a quick but interesting build.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The figures and set</b></div><div>There are four figures in this set. The first one is the Arc Trooper with back pack who is one of the best Star Wars figure that's been seen for some time. The figure has a brightly decorated leg piece with different colour shadings includes too. His torso piece is also nicely decorated with what looks like a walkie talkie printed and also light blue printing over the traditional white &nbsp;coloured torso piece. There is also printing on the back which is simple but effective. This however is concealed by the backpack piece which consists of three pieces. The figure head piece includes a printed face but of course is hidden by the Clone trooper helmet which is nicely coloured in dark red and light blue on top of the traditional white colours there. This figure also comes with two small guns, headwear accesseries and a cloak and trouser piece as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second figure is another Arc trooper who also has printing on his front and back of his torso. However, this figure is not as complex design wise as the backpack clone as he doesn't have printing on his leg piece and the printing on his torso is only white and black with the only other decoration in detail being on his arms which are coloured dark red. His helmet piece seems to half resemble a shock trooper from episode 6 however the different printings of red and slight different shape at the back make it more different from so. He also comes with a large gun piece too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third and fourth figures of the battle pack are the Commando Droids who are a dark brown colour and have minor eye printing and also a red dot on their chest. Both figures are identical and are formed by the leg piece of a super battle droids and the chest of a standard battle droids. They both also come with medium sized guns too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The main and only other centre piece of the small set other than the figures is the small &nbsp;turret like vehicle which is coloured in many different colours of dark grey, dark red, light grey and a bit of black and gold as well. The turret vehicle can seat one trooper figure on the seat included. The legs of the model can be repositioned and click in to place any way you wish to display the model. There are two play functions of the vehicle [other than it's movable legs] which are the turret can be lift up and down and also the push fire missile which can be fired by a push button at the back of the shooter turret.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Summary</b></div><div>&nbsp;If you're a big fan of Star Wars, Clone Troopers, Clone Wars, Battle Packs, Army building and also after cheap licensed sets, I would strongly recommend this set. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,2

When I saw these guys wearing prototype phase 2 armour on The Clone Wars, I immediately decided that it's the best Clone/Stormtrooper armour ever. And in LEGO form, it works great. He has a cloth Kama, a cloth Pauldron, printed legs, detailed torso and that beautiful helmet that combines the awesome phase 2 visor with the older fin on top. Other minifigs are also good. The ARF Trooper is similar to the older one and the Commando Droids are about SBD level cool. <br><br>The build:<br>Fun, but short. After building the epic Pre Vizsla's Mandalorian Fighter, this was rather unimpressive. But still some clever techniques and stuff used.<br><br>Appearence &amp; functions:<br>The cannon is hopelessly out of scale with minifigs, despite what the box and instructions say.

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-26T21:22:22.753Z","Battle Packs Growing Repetitive?","<p><strong>Set #9488 Elite Clone Trooper &amp; Commando Droid Battle Pack:</strong> LEGO Star Wars has had a good five years of Battle Packs, small sets which include four (or five) Mini-Figures as troop builders so you can rapidly purchase a lot of identical Imperial, Rebel, Seperatist and Republic forces. Each one includes a small model to build and quite frankly for the past four years we've been getting a lot of clone battle packs and aside from print they're all pretty much identical. Still there are some good aspects of them.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ARF Trooper Helmet is one that hasn't been seen in too many sets so bringing it back for this troop builder set is great, especially with the dark red print details on it making it stand out from 2011's ARF Trooper. 
<li>Commando Droids are also somewhat rare and great to see in a cheap set. 
<li>The new cloth pauldron piece and cloth Clone skirt work so much nicer than the plastic ones found in the Clone Walker Battle Pack from 2009, it took a few years but LEGO managed to make some great new pieces. 
<li>The model for the clone cannon or walker or whatever it is, is a pretty nice mini model, it looks better than some of the other mini models that past Battle Packs have included. I'm glad LEGO can design these small builds to include with Battle Packs so they can be released.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having troop builder sets with two factions fighting one another don't work as well as the battle packs where you have just one faction. Because it limits how many Mini-Figures from each faction you get. This means that there are no troops besides the ARF Trooper for the Clone Commander to lead. 
<li>The Commando Droids are very top heavy, they fall down much easier than Battle Droids do when holding their blasters, I suspect this may be a result of the differences in head pieces used for the droids. This is a minor flaw, still a flaw though as the Commando Droids just love falling over when the shelf is nudged ever so slightly.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I think this is not as good as the Endor Rebel Trooper vs. Imperial Trooper Battle Pack from 2012, it's the weaker of the two mainly because the premise of this Battle Pack could have been stretched out to include enough Clones and Commando Droids in two seperate battle packs.</p>
<p>The model and the Mini-Figures aren't bad, their print work and the new cloth accessories made for the Clone Commander really stand out as some great new pieces introduced to LEGO Star Wars. And improve upon the old Plastic Parts that were around only a few short years ago. That being said it's hard to recommend buying multiples of this set for army building like with other battle packs. However it's worth picking up one of at least to flesh out your Clone Army and Droid Army, you can always buy the Mini-Figures seperately on Bricklink if you want just the ARF Trooper without tons of identical Commanders.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"Zatth","2012-10-19T08:35:46.723Z","Excellent Minifigures!","The title says most of it; this is an excellent set for minifigures!<br><br>So let's start with the Minifigures: The set contains four figs: an ARF Trooper, an ""Elite"" Clone Trooper, and 2 BX-Commando Battle Droids.<br><br>Firstly, the Droids: Not necessarily the most anticipated minifigures, but they are unique and very nicely done. The brown paint fits them perfectly, although the heads are a bit truncated. I'm not sure if that is canon or not.<br><br>Secondly, the ARF Trooper: This guy is really cool. His helmet is very carefully detailed, some have said that the markings are those of Commander Wolfe's unit. I am inclined to agree. His helmet is also a well-molded piece and looks great.<br><br>Thirdly, the ""Elite"" Clone Trooper: He is (or was) one of the most anticipated Star Wars minifigures, and he did not disappoint. He has detailed, unique printing on both the front <i>and</i> the back of his body (now that is rare), he has a rare cloth pauldron piece and a rare cloth kama (both very cool pieces, much nicer than the plastic ones introduced last year) and his helmet is actually a new mold. I've compared it to a regular clone trooper, and sure enough, the ""Elite"" clone has a different helmet. A neat little brick-built backpack and a helmet attachment round out this excellent minifigure.<br><br>The cannon is the big structure in this set, and it is very well done. It contains a lot more basic pieces than most battle packs, so MOC'ing is an option. Of course, it contains the ever-present flick-fire missile... but otherwise, it looks very realistic. I can't help imagining that the Droids have a serious disadvantage here...<br><br>All in all, this is a very unique and fun battle pack that is worth the money!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"legolover2001","2013-07-26T10:44:21.727Z","9488: Elite Clone Trooper & Commando Droid Battle Pack","<p>The thing that first drew me to this set is the clones, they are (for me) the stars of this set. This was also the first set to include Commando Droids (now also included in 75012 and 75002).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The front of the box has for once, has (almost, the ARF trooper in the AV-7 firing at a unknown place) in the right way. Commando droids at the left, clones and AV-7 at the right with an explosion an the distance. The location seems to be Geonosis. The back has the ARC trooper sneaking up on the Commando droids and the ARF trooper seems to be getting the AV-7 STARTED UP. It also shows pictures of how to fire the cannons flick-missile, a picture of how the cannon moves, a picture a view of the cannon from the front and side and a picture of the cannon firing a laser on it's own at a Commando droid (ghost vehicle wasting power? strange, eh?). The instructions are nice and easy to follow (boo! We want hard!) and at the end it has a little comic. <br><h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many good pieces dark red parts and all the 1x3 piece which I always need.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>COMMANDO DROIDS: The legs are the same as the Super Battle Droids but in brown and the torso has a small red dot on the leftside with one straight arm and the head is a new mould for the minifigure, like a normal battle droids but with a much small noses pressed onto their necks with white lines and eyes that make it look like it's squinting to see clearly, they also come with a rifle. ARF TROOPER: Like most other clone it has boring white and black legs which are always a let down, the torso is the same as most clones but with dark red arms and black hands, the head is your regular ugly clone head and the helmet has the most amazing printing with what looks like a birds face printing of the side with also a bit of light blue here and there. He too comes with a rifle. ARC TROOPER: My favourite. The legs are printed (finely) with good detail with a black cloth thing around the waist, the torso is even better with four red squares for other troops to know his rank an a device of some sort on the light blue breastplate with back printing, a backpack made out of four pieces and another cloth thing in dark red around the head slot, the head is also your normal clone head (well, I suppose they are clones) and the head has a large amount of light blue and dark red dots and you can add a dark red communications device or clip on binoculars on it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><h4>The build</h4>Not much to say about the build except the gun part of the cannon made a good point on how to build your own guns.
<h4>The completed model</h4>Nice looking AV-7 Antivehicle Cannon built there, completely out of scale though as I realised (observe:&nbsp; http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/AV-7_Antivehicle_Cannon ). You can move the legs around and it has a seat with handle for the ARF trooper and it also has a half flick missile (half because you push a techinic piece to make it fly towards unsuspecting droids. On the bottom it has a clear piece to help it keep stable. <br><h4>Summary</h4>Over all, if you have a load of droids to destroy and not much clones to spare then this is the set for you as the Elite's are probably my favourite minifigures in my Star Wars collection. I have to say though, £11.99/$12.99 is quite expensive but I suppose the minifigures are great and the clones are exclusive. <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"B_Scheibs","2012-06-06T13:54:39.793Z","Stunning Figures for a Battle Pack!","Elite Clone Trooper and Commando Droid Battle Pack is a battle pack that got a lot of attention once people saw what the figures were. It has 98 pieces, 4 minifigures, and retails for $12.99, putting us at 13.2 cents per piece, which is better than most battle packs nowadays. This was easily the most anticipated set from the winter 2012 Star Wars sets when I first saw final pictures of it. I was pumped, and I even thought it could be the best battle pack to date. The ARC Trooper and new Commando Droids were causing a lot of hype, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this set. Was all that excitement really worth it though?<br><br>Before I begin, I want to note the boxes and instructions are different this time around. First off, the box has the new Darth Maul logo because of Star Wars 3D. I like the new logo, but miss Captain Rex. Another note is on the back, they no longer advertise other LEGO Star Wars sets, which I like since now they can show more of the set you actually bought, like extra pictures showing it from different angles and sides. Also, the instructions are smaller and don't come folded up, so that's a plus. They even have a 4 panel comic, and this one shows Elite Clones ambushing the Commando Droids.<br><br>The reason you'll buy the set is for the figures. First up is the ARC Trooper, one of my favorite figures of all time. It takes 7 steps to build him in the instructions, and he has 11 pieces, which is twice as much than usual. He features a Phase 1.5 helmet, which is a mix of Phases 1 and 2. The middle is printed grayish blue, and there are 3 red dots on each side of the helmet. The rangefinder is red, and you get 3 extra's, along with 4 extra red visors, which is nice. The figure features a black cloth waist-cape, and the shoulder pauldron is a red cloth as well. The torso features standard front and back clone printing, but on the front the rest of the shoulder pauldron continuing down was printed, which looks much better. On the back is a small little backpack, and the legs are red with boot printing and come with plenty of detail on the armor. Overall, a fantastic figure!<br><br>The ARF trooper has the same helmet mold as last time, but this time we get a rancor version. The arms are red, but the torso and legs remain the same as a normal clone. The helmet is beautiful, as we get spots of light blue throughout, and the rancor symbols are printed perfectly on each side. On the top, we get extra lines of red printing, which are great and really add to the figure. I like this ARF trooper just as much as the original one!<br><br>Lastly are the Commando Droids, which we get two of. They come in a chocolate brown color and unlike Battle Droids, they aren't flimsy and hold together well. The torso has a red dot on the red side, and both the torso and arms are from a standard Battle Droid, and the legs are from a Super Battle Droid. The head is accurate and well sculpted, but the printing is strange and has a serious, menacing look. They're just OK, but nice to have.<br><br>The cannon is a very basic and simple build. They are much larger on the show, but they had to scale it down since this is a battle pack. There is a clear column piece on the bottom holding it up, which keeps it from sagging. I like the way the legs were built, since they are attached sideways using SNOT, and hold up nicely. The clone gets a seat with a handlebar, which was nice to have. The weakest part is the actual cannon that fires, which to me needs a lot of improvement. It's too short, and it goes from being thick to thin quickly, so it's not very sleek. It does move up and down, and sadly includes a flick missile- BOO! If LEGO is going to put two factions in one battle pack, each side deserves something at least, so the Commando Droids deserved some type of vehicle or a cannon. Overall, it's decent, but not the greatest. However, there are some nice parts, the best being 5 3x1 flat tiles, and a grilled column piece.<br><br>In the end, I don't think this is the best battle pack so far. Indeed, 7913 still holds the number one spot for me. The reason is that ALL of the figures were outstanding, and the vehicle you got was much better. Here, only the ARC Trooper and ARF Trooper are good, as I don't like the Commando Droids that much. The biggest problem with the set is that two sides are included. It worked with 9489, but not here. You got something for each side in that set, and the figures were worth army building with. I don't see too many people buying multiples of this set to army build, as the figures aren't good enough to do so. It doesn't mean they're bad, it's just that people won't want multiples of the ARC Trooper. In the end, the clones are great, but the Commando Droids are just average. I really do like the battle pack, but I would have liked it more if only clones were included. The clones and pieces make this set a must-buy, so it gets a 4 out of 5. I recommend this set for the clones, but if you aren't interested, skip it and buy something else. I hope you found this review helpful, and that you enjoyed reading it.<br><br>- BrickLife4809<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

"Xendor173","2014-10-19T17:58:03.117Z","DROID COMMANDOS!!!","<p>This is one Battle Pack that I just couldn&#39;t pass up! The set is a great idea, and hosts great playability. It also brings great additions to both the Republic and Separatist armies.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is good. Easy to handle, easy to open. The images show the set in all its glory, and perfectly advertise what it can do.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only parts that I would bring praise to would be the two clone helmets, the ARC trooper&#39;s... skirt, kilt?... and the Droid Commandos heads. There is one part that I found unnecessary, but I&#39;ll get to that in &quot;The build.&quot;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The ARC trooper is probably the best reason to get this set. Though I&#39;m still waiting for the Republic Commandos, these guys are just as capable, and way more recognizable. Anyone who has seen the Clone Wars saga (i.e. Star Wars I, II and III) have seen these guys. And they get especially recognized in the CGI TV Show by Cartoon Network, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, as we watch on of the greatest squads live through, until the last one is falsely accused, and killed.</p>

<p>The ARF trooper is another great addition. ARF armor is my favorite light trooper armor, so I wanted to get an ARF trooper since the first one in set 7913 (Clone Trooper Battle Pack) came out.</p>

<p>The Commando Droids are another great addition. One of the first sets to host these guys, they make a great addition to the Separatist army as the most flexible, agile, and deadly droids in the army.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself is great. With this miniature version of the AV-7 Anti-Vehicle Cannon, the Republic has an easily portable turret to bring down any enemy fighter. However, the center clear piece in the middle I found to be unnecessary. I took it off once I was done and pressed down, and the set didn&#39;t budge. So I took the piece and attached it to the bottom of 8015 (Assassin Droids Battle Pack). It took about seven minutes to build, so very worth it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Worth it. For four awesome minifigures, a highly playable cannon, and a fast build, this set was completely worth it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is quite possibly the best Battle Pack ever.</p>

<h3>Box and Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small and attractively designed, with that Darth Maul logo banner. The instructions are easy to read and come bent. There&#39;s a minifigure checklist at the back.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build for this one is actually pretty interesting. It&#39;s fast, but the way it&#39;s done is cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two&nbsp;<strong>Commando Droids&nbsp;</strong>in the set. They&#39;re good, but I&#39;d have liked regular droids for their versatility. The&nbsp;<strong>ARF Trooper&nbsp;</strong>is good too. His helmet has some nice Dark Red print on it, and he is armed with a blaster rifle. The&nbsp;<strong>ARC Trooper</strong>&nbsp;is one of my favorite clone trooper figures. he has some great detailing, and lots of accessories. I would have preferred the older pistols though.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>The model is a simple cannon. Its color scheme matches that of the clone trooper figures, and it looks like a Republic cannon.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The set is fun to play with. The clones can shoot a flick missile at the enemy, and the cannon elevates and can be lowered. There is also a simple seat for the gunner, but only the ARF fits on it.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an awesome set, and I recommend multiples.</p>

"omega64","2021-02-15T18:19:21.333Z","The best clone trooper Lego has ever made","<p>As I established from my previous review, I always buy lego sets factory sealed, which becomes a problem when you want a specific minifigure, and it comes in a set that&#39;s very expensive on the second hand market, likely because of said minifigure. Such is the case for this set, and I can&#39;t say I regret my purchase.</p>

<p>The titular clones make incredible additions to my growing army, particularly the arc trooper with his leg printing and many accessories. By comparison, the arf trooper seems a little less exciting, but his unique helmet printing and red arms just about make up for his plain white legs. Of course, they both feature the infamous animated style head underneath, but that can&#39;t spoil what is, undoubtedly, an outstanding pair of minifigures. The commando droids are also welcome additions, especially considering that they&#39;re surprisingly rare, with this variant only appearing elsewhere in a brickmaster book.</p>

<p>As for the build, it&#39;s the typical battle pack affair, a cannon mounted on four legs, with a seat for the arf trooper to control it. However, I think this is one of the better ones they&#39;ve made over the years. Perhaps it&#39;s my nostalgia, but there&#39;s also some genuinely great design choices here that are absent on similar models. For instance, whereas other builds of this nature have their legs on a single joint, these have two, making it more believable that this thing could actually walk. Complimenting this, the transparent piece mounted underneath ensures the &quot;feet&quot; don&#39;t buckle during play. Speaking of playability, the actual barrel of the cannon hides a flick fire missile under it, utilising a simple but effective technique involving a technic rod to maintain the gimmick without sacrificing depth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is well worth it. Unfortunately, so do sellers on sites like ebay, where my copy was bought. If you&#39;re looking for this set MISB, prepare to pay somewhere between &pound;50-&pound;60. On the bright side, you&#39;ll have plenty of chances to, as listings appear quite often. Happy hunting!</p>

"Captainfives1514","2022-12-20T00:24:09.937Z","Clone Commandos ","<p>&nbsp; I have a couple of this set. I loved the clones and droids that came in this set. The cannon not so much.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Minifigures;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Clone ARC&nbsp;trooper is one of the most detailed Minifigures ever created in my opinion.&nbsp;His helmet has blue and red highlights with the option to add a dark red visor or rangefinder. He also has a cloth black kama and dark red shoulder pads. He also wears a brick built backpack. His torso is printed with red and blue highlights as well as his legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Clone ARF trooper is also a great minifigure. His helmet is a special moulded helmet with red highlights. His torso has normal clone armour printing with plain white legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Two Commando Droids are also included and there also excellent minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is pretty simple and also kind of very repetitive due to the fact that the four legs are built the same way. The only functions are you can pose the legs, elevate the canon and fire the flick missile. I have never had much success with the flick missile. &nbsp;<br />
With it&nbsp;never going much farther than a foot or so.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I only wonder if the new 501st battle pack will prove better than its predecessor?</p>
