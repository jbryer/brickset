"CapnRex101","2011-12-30T12:30:47.823Z","9489 - Endor Rebel Trooper and Imperial Trooper Battle Pack","<p>This is a nice set, the Minifigures are excellent and the parts selection is even better. It somewhat pales in comparison with the Elite Clone Trooper and Commando Droid Battle Pack sadly, but is still a fantastic addition to anyone's collection. There are no brand new figures in this set, but all four figures have been revised (albeit slightly) from their&nbsp;previous&nbsp;incarnations, and all of them are&nbsp;improved.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>I love the new box design as I mentioned in my previous review, the picture of Darth Maul is brilliant on the border and the new colour scheme is great. The set itself is displayed on a forest background which is presumably Endor and has the obligatory explosions and laser blasts flying around everywhere. The flick fire missile is heading for the speeder bike to demonstrate that feature. The back of the box shows the features of the set and a sort of blueprint image of the speeder bike from various angles which looks very effective.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are fine with the same brilliant artwork as the box, one interesting point is the inclusion of a small comic at the back of the booklet which shows the Rebels destroying the speeder bike. I had no missing pieces.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are one of the sweet spots in my opinion for this set, if you want to build an Endor MOC, this set has all the parts you need (just not very many of them so it would be&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to buy multiples of this set). There are a few pieces of foliage and one of those nice brown tree bow pieces. There are many other pieces in brown as well which would be useful for making trees for your various MOCS. I love the little green flower piece which goes on the bunker (you even get a spare) which I first saw in the Winter Village Bakery from 2010.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures are wonderful. All four of them are revised from their last edition, most excitingly, the<b>&nbsp;Stormtrooper&nbsp;</b>figure has a brand new torso print, both front and back which looks absolutely spectacular. Both the Scout Trooper and the Stormtrooper have one of the new heads with a face printed on which I like. The <b>Scout Trooper</b>'s torso, legs and helmet are all&nbsp;identical&nbsp;to the older ones, unlike the Stormtrooper the head must be swivelled around to fill the goggles in black. He carries a small pistol which is nice. The Stormtrooper has a regular short blaster.</p><p>The <b>Rebel Commandos</b> are great too. One of them has the same torso and legs as the older Commandos, the other has a new torso print with a shirt and camouflaged jacket which is very good. One of them has the Indiana Jones face and the other has what I think is a new face, he has cheek lines and brown eyebrows. The helmets are the same as the old ones, they look great as always and incredibly accurate to the film. The&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;for them are one long rifle, one pistol (like that of the Scout Trooper) and a pair of grey binoculars.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very short. I have always liked how the speeder bikes are constructed, especially the use of the trike&nbsp;chassis&nbsp;piece. Apart from that there isn't much to be said for it really!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As a set there is everything you need for a battle. Two Imperials and two Rebels, they are pretty evenly matched I would say which allows for even more potential&nbsp;playability. The Rebel bunker is built on a circular base in dark green which looks good and has a small tree, a turret with a flick fire missile, and a weapon rack. Below the flick fire missile there is some kind of gun barrel which looks a bit odd, at least I think that is what it is.</p><p>The speeder is slightly updated from the one in the Ewok Attack set (which goes very well with this set by the way) with both the middle and the back a bit different. It is a slight improvement as this speeder is a bit more durable than the last.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would advise you to purchase this set. I like the Minifigures in particular, especially the new Stormtrooper who looks fantastic. The accessories are good too with plenty of guns for you troops. The set itself may leave something to be desired but as a playset, it isn't bad at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Paradoxymoron","2012-01-28T16:53:32.51Z","Must have... For Endor collectors","<p>I found this set (along with several others) at Toys R Us today. Had a couple of coupons, so I got this and two others (9488 and 9491). My main reason for getting this set is my obsession with Endor, and thus everything related to it. As such, despite the overall lack of appeal of the set itself, it was one that was, in my eyes, mandatory.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is pretty much what one would come to expect. The usual info, a scene depicting the entirety of the set, and the Star Wars banner. The main thing to note is that the Star Wars banner now contains Darth Maul, likely to commemorate the 3D release of Phantom Menace this year. The back depicts the set's play function(s?), and also shows a few views of the speeder bike.</p>The instructions were clear, with no incorrect or out-of-order pages. Interestingly, there is a short mini comic with the set's minifigs in the back.
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Fairly standard parts. The only parts I saw a real need to be excited about are the flower things (Never seen them in green before) and some parts on the minifigs.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The rebel troopers are great. One has the same torso as the Battle of Endor set, while the other has a tan vest on. Both have front and back printing, which is excellent of course. The legs are plain sand green legs. Their hands are an odd shade of pale yellow, not the flesh color of the heads. I was most delighted with the helmets, because they actually stay on the figs' heads, unlike the ones in the Battle of Endor set.</p><p>The Storm Trooper has been revamped, and his new appearance is one that I can't decide if I really like or not. The torso is quite a bit different, and also contains back printing. He also has the new head which is black, but with a face on one side. The downside to this face is that the black shows through the flesh colored printing, darkening the color. This is the same with the Scout Trooper, who, aside from this head, is the same as all previous Scout Troopers.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very straightforward. Not much to really say about it. In absolutely no time at all the set is complete before you.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The tree/base thing is not much, but it serves it's purpose well. It is really just a round plate with a single branch and a flick-launcher. I suppose that with a few of these, one could combine the parts from this section and make it a little better. As it is, it's not really much to look at.</p><p>The speeder is quite simple, at much like previous incarnations. I'm probably alone in this, but I am kind of annoyed that they keep altering the speeder bike design ever so slightly. It makes it a bit odd to have an Imperial army with several variations of the same speeder. What I believe is the best alteration on this speeder is the inclusion of one of those 2x2 round slidey things on the bottom, so that it doesn't get caught up on studs/carpets.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll admit it is a bit playable for the people who will play with it. Unlike previous battle packs, this contains two figs of each faction, so with one set you can pit them against each other. There is also a fairly even divide as to which parts go to which side (something that cannot be said for 9488).<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Again, I have to say that the only reason I got this was because I am an Endor Collector. The base thing is pointless, there are speeder bikes in other sets, and the minifigs are really nothing new and exciting. On top of that, the price of $15 dollars seems a tad much. All in all, I would say that, if you really want a battle pack, your best bet would be to go with 9488, which has more parts and more interesting figs. <br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-03-31T18:57:36.387Z","Nice day for a run in the forest.","Here we go, adding to that Endor theme. I kind of like it actually. What it lacks in trees or extensive Endor-shrubbery it makes up with the minifigs and the speeder.&nbsp;<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div><b>Two rebel soldiers</b> are included with excellent colours and printing. I am a huge fan of the helmets, which look very accurate to the ROTJ movie. It's nice how they have made the faces and torsos slightly different to each soldier. Good job there.&nbsp;</div><div><b>One stormtrooper</b> is also included, and a <b>biker scout</b>. Their new faces are a nice addition and a welcome change.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Tree/speeder bike.</h4><div>This set is nice in the way that you can learn some basic treebuilding. Putting a cannon for ambushing the Imperials is a good idea in my opinion. It is built almost like a stakeout hiding place under a tree, and you also get some small flowers added. I am not sure about the gray piece crossing the grass. Those rebs shouldn't take anything for granted, though. Because in this small set you also get an always appreciated speeder bike.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>The set.</h4><div><br></div><div>It is a small set, no question about it. But I reckon a couple of these sets together will make a great army builder for the future. It does feel a bit too small in my opinion. Younger fans will have no problems with it at all, since the playability is great for such a small set. And even if you didn't find it at a reduced or the <i>right price</i> it would be totally worth it anyways. I'll try getting a few, that's for sure.

"tkettle9719","2012-02-26T11:09:46.037Z","Ewok Attack Extension? I Like!","<p>I got this set last night at Target for myself, mainly as an Ewok Attack extension, and was surprised by the small things that make this set excellent. The tree is a nice edition to the Ewok base, and you can't go wrong with another speeder bike like that in the aforementioned set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The minifigs are nice here, since I didn't have any of these until now. Imperial faces are also nice here. <br></li><li>-The varying gun sizes are also a nice, small addition; they add a bit more variation to the set.</li><li>-The small cannon, albeit looking a bit strange, has a nice flick-fire missile (which killed my poor Stormtrooper).<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-It feels a bit small for the price of 13 dollars; then again, that's every Star Wars set these days...<br></li><li>-I wish that the Speeder bike didn't have to have his face turned to look normal; maybe an addition to the Scout helmet piece?<br></li><li>-Maybe another small weapon for the Imperial forces would be welcome, equalizing the chances for either faction to win (and because I'm Empire all the way). <br></li></ul>
<p>This small set is nice, especially since it can officially be called an Endor battle pack with the Rebels and the Empire. I think that the idea is smart, and small kids will be happy that there's so much more playability. I like this set a lot, personally, but the price tag is steep for what you do get. I recommend it, but consider waiting for a small sale (2 dollars less would be pretty reasonable, I think).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Goldmatt","2012-03-14T13:53:39.37Z","The Battle for Endor Continues...","First of all this a really nice set. The main center points are the speeder bike and the tree, however the mini figures are the reason I purchased this set. The tree is fairly small and the style actually reminds me more of set 7625 than any other Endor sets but works extremely well with 7956 also. First the minifigs are incredible. The scout trooper has stayed the same with the exception of the new head piece, which must be reversed when the helmet is on. The stormtrooper has the new head too but has an updated torso print.<div>The Rebel commandoes were the highlight of the set for me with a new commando chest print and head for one with an Indy/Dastan head on the other, but I found the beard much lighter on mine than on the box. The speeder bike is slightly different than the one in 7956 with the front fork in gray and no rear seating. I found this a spectacular set but probably only if you have 8038 or 7956 should you purchase it, as it doesn't work very well alone.</div>",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-07T06:44:49.677Z","LEGO Star Wars - Endor Rebel Trooper & Imperial Trooper Battle Pack Review","This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 77 pieces and it is 13 USD. That means that the price per piece ratio is 17 cents per piece which is a good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 4 minifigs. We get a stormtrooper which has a new printing on his face. The biker scout has the same face as well. The rebels look very nice, too. One of them has a face which looks a little bit like the one from Indiana Jones and the hands are printed in a peach color, so I assume that these're supposed to be gloves. The other rebel trooper has a tan vest which could mean that this guy is a commander.<br></p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-25T10:29:58.95Z","Expand your Battle for Endor","<p>Set #9489 Endor Rebel Trooper &amp; Imperial Trooper Battle Pack: Good morning one and all and a Merry Christmas to you, or if not celebrating, well happy holiday equivalent folks. I hope this morning you'll find a lot of great new LEGO waiting under the tree&nbsp;for you, and what better set to find there than one of these battle packs?</p>
<p>The ERT/ITBP, for short, is an impressive set introduced to us by LEGO at the onset of 2012, by now you may have already recieved one of these sets last year for the holidays, or even during the long months that followed. Still it's a great set to find under the tree, or to get for any special occasion, and it's also great for army building the new Endor Rebel Trooper Mini-Figs and Imperial Forces.</p>
<p>The Speeder Bike is a tried and tested model amongst LEGO's other Endor sets, over the years it has seen many revisions, this version is one of the sleeker looking variants. We've seen this exact build I believe in other sets, indeed the same speeder in Hoth colors was included in 2010's Snowtrooper Battle Pack, there are only a few minor differences between the models aside from color. Such as the placement of the black megaphone piece. Who can say no to it though?</p>
<p>The other buildable aspect of this set is... Well it's a tree plain and simple, it stands on two dark green semi-circular plates, really nice dark green color actually&nbsp;a rare site in LEGO. For added play value the tiny Endor set piece includes a flick-fire missile launcher on a swivel plate and some sort of miniature barricade or something, that honestly just looks a tad goofy. There is also one of the new Friends flower petal pieces in Green. (And you get an extra one too.)</p>
<p>The Mini-Figs are truly worth the price of this set alone, not only do you get a Stormtrooper and Scout Trooper, with printing we've seen before, but each of them has a brand new facial print. No longer are they all bland, faceless black headed minions, now you get smiling, unshaven soldiers to stand around without helmets on. It is about time LEGO did something for the Imperials that makes them less odd looking without their helmets on.</p>
<p>The two new Rebel Troopers are great, both of them feature double-sided torsos wearing the green camouflage gear on Endor. The torsos are more than likely not that new, I would assume they were included in The Battle of Endor set, however I don't yet own that set to know for sure. None of them get a double-sided head, however we do get a brand new headpiece, the Endor hat as seen in the film. Much like the previous years' new Hoth hat piece, this is a welcome addition for Movie Accurate looks in the Mini-Figs. Past sets... Well past sets avoided Endor to be honest, up until 2009's Battle for Endor set most RotJ sets focused on Ewoks, Biker Scouts, Luke, Jabba's Palace and the final battle between Skywalker and Vader. LEGO is just now starting to make up for that, and this little Battle Pack is just great. Plus the new hat piece is better than what we would have gotten in the early days of LEGO Star Wars when making new, screen accurate accessories just wasn't in the budget.</p>
<p>Speaking of accessories, you get a smattering of the different Blaster types in this set, there's the smaller pistol, the larger sniper style rifle and of course the Blaster Pistol itself wielded by the Stormtrooper. Plus a pair of Macrobinoculars for one of the Rebel Troopers to be observing the Imperials with.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great set, great for parts and Mini-Figs, the little forest set piece is a bit of a weaker model as is often the case with battle packs some of the designs for models are obviously just thrown in to get the set over and done with. Still fun though, and with a small army of this set you can use the pieces to MOC a much better looking defensive position for your Rebel Troopers. Strongly reccomended for everybody and getting multiples is a must for the Mini-Figs. Each torso print is unique, so you get a total of four different torsos to mix-and-match if you'd like. And again, Happy Holidays!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Chills","2012-10-24T11:04:28.34Z","Great Endor battle Army Builder","<p>LEGO is contractually obligated NOT to sell just Star Wars figures, but LEGO wanted a way for fans to build up their minifigure armies without having to buy multiple large sets. They came up with battle packs, inexpensive sets that are focused on minifigures, but also have small sets with them. This battle pack fulfills mission requirements, and its a fun set to build.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The main purpose of this set is to give you minifigures for cheap, and it does so quite well. All minifigures are unique to this set, though similar to others. You get two rebel commandos, one looks like an officer with a pistol and binoculars and the other a heavy weapons guy, with a large rifle and grenades. The Imperials both have faces, which are cool when you remove their helmets. Their bodies are also highly detailed, and the stormtrooper has printing on his back.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The tree makes a nice addition to an Endor battle scene. With a few sets you can also use the cool forest-colored pieces to MOC your own trees.<br></li><li>Pro 3: You also get a speeder bike. This version is almost exactly the same as the one in Ewok attack 7956, with only slight differences. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Pretty much the only negative I can give to this set is the flick-fire missile. LEGO just LOVES to put these things in the sets. I think a more appropriate addition would be a catapult (but there are no Ewoks, so maybe something else) or a weapons cache, or a turret.<br></li></ul>
<p>I also own both Ewok Attacks 7958 and 7139, and Battle for Endor 8038. This battle pack is great for building up both your Imperial and Rebel forces to join those sets. Of course you need Ewoks, too, so maybe LEGO will make an Ewok battle pack. If you're creating an Endor battle scene buying this set is must. If you're a collector, this set has cool and unique minifigures. If you're buying for a young LEGO fan this set has good playability.

"Geodude77","2020-07-16T10:14:25.787Z","Little set of Endor","<h3>9489-1</h3>

<p>Ok ,so I don&rsquo;t remember how I got this set because it was a long time ago.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set ,there is two types of rebel troopers. One of them has a bearded face that is not double sided. It has a sort of angry face. His weapon is a rifle and easily fits in his hand which is beige ( I think he might have gloves on). His torso has printing that suggests that he has a camouflage coat with straps going across it ( they could be ammunition storage). His leg piece is just plain green. His hat or helmet is the normal one for the Endor rebel troopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The next rebel troop has a straight face and the same helmet as the one I was talking about above. This one has a small pistol and grey binoculars. I think that this works well with this style of rebel trooper. His torso has a beige colour jacket with a belt down at the bottom. Lastly, his legs are the same as the other rebel that comes in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The scout trooper is next and it has the plain black face with a kind of cheeky grin on the back. The helmet is moulded very well in my opinion. It is the same scout trooper helmet, but the torso is different to the ones in the Ewok village set ( 10236-1 ) although it is the same as the one in Ewok attack set ( 7956-1 ). There is&nbsp;two small satchels on either side of the belt and white armour on the chest. The weapon is a small pistol and the leg armour is plain white.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lastly, the stormtrooper. It just has the standard helmet and the same white leg armour as the scout trooper. The weapon for the stormtrooper is a standard medium sized blaster. This stormtrooper has detailed armour, which is a good thing.</p>

<h3>Speeder bike and main build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The speeder bike is a very cool and well built model in my opinion.&nbsp;It is a&nbsp;similar model (not the same)&nbsp;to the ones in Ewok attack (mentioned earlier ) and Ewok village (also mentioned earlier). On the back,there can be a backpack and there is a gun of some sort on the side(to me it looks like a megaphone).</p>

<p>&nbsp;The main build is a brick-built&nbsp;tree with a cannon to fire at the speeder bike. I really think they could have improved this part of the set, I don&rsquo;t really think it has all of the features a main build should have in a battle pack. The missiles are good for small children because they can be flicked out for extra playability.</p>

<h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Overall, I think that this is a fairly good set, although could be better. It might be better if they included an Ewok, as that would make sense. So, it has good playability, especially if you have the other sets that are based on Endor.</p>

<h3>Pros and cons</h3>
