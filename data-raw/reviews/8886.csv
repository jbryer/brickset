<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>the box art is fantastic depicting darth maul attacking in rage weilding his double bladed lightsaber this replaces the previous image of captain rex the box.The front shows the set in action with the jedi and gree fighting the geonosians and the cannon. The colour scheme is still dark blue but is combined with white which gives it a sleek effect. The star wars logo has changed to a dark blue to stand out with the white.The back of the box no longer shows you other sets instead it simply shows you a comic strip style story of the good guys defeating the bad guys! also the features of the set.the instruction manual has how to build it but also contains an interesting information page providing the names of the minifigures in the set and a small one page comic strip showing bariss defeating the cannon.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>there are some very nice dark tan and brown pieces in this set and the geonosian blasters look really excellent once assembled. There are also some trans green light cone peices which are quite cool looking. Also the new short blue cape is very good and the new wings there is also a new dark blue hood which to my knowledge has never been used in another set before.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>minifigs are great as they include bariss offee who has a brand new and improved torso and a short dark blue cape along with a dark blue hood and a blue lightsaber. Also the face print is far more deatiled and goes well with the clone wars luminara unduli unlike the 2010 episode 3 version of this figure. Commander gree is also included his printing is great and the ammo belt printed on the torso is very detailed as is the one on the back. He also includes leg printing and a printed helmet he is a very accurate minifigure apart from the head which is an averege clone trooper head rather than a head unique to gree. The geonosians however are very detailed and include both a zombie geonosian and a warrior geonosian they both have the same torso design but in different colours and differnt printing. The zombie looks really cool and seems almost possesed as his eyes are blank and lifeless and for those of you who have the geonosian starfighter from 2011 the warrior is just the same dark tan figure but with wings.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>apart from the minifigures the build is rather standard: first you build the base of the cannon and then the legs then the cannon itself.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>it looks rather cool the cannon is&nbsp;very stylised and looks a lot like the one in the movies videogames and clone wars series. Along with the minfigures the set looks awesome if you set it up right. The cannon however is quite small but it is to the right minifigure scale and is very realistic.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>overall the set does not dissapoint and even on it's own it looks quite good the price is slightly off as this retails for £19.99 uk pounds but this would be better as the cannon is small if a speeder or walker had been included otherwise this should maybe be £16 rather than £20 but this set is worth it for the minifigs as it includes a fair ammount rather than the usual two in the £20 sets but four which is very welcome and should continue in that fashion with all star wars&nbsp;twenty pound&nbsp;sets. so overall i would highly recmmend you pick this up bear in mind if you have the other two geonosis sets it combines with them beautifully.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"CapnRex101","2011-12-30T16:58:28.39Z","9491 - Geonosian Cannon","<p>The Geonosian Cannon is a set I have been extremely excited for! I am in no way disappointed, it is everything I imagined it would be and more! All four of the Minifigures are absolutely spectacular, and all new! I cannot see any way they could&nbsp;improve&nbsp;the accuracy of the cannon with the pieces at their disposal and the playability is great too.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art shows the cannon in action firing flick fire missiles at the oncoming Clone army as&nbsp;Barriss&nbsp;Offee and Commander Gree charge ahead to destroy the cannon and the Geonosian troops. All of this takes place on a Geonosian desert background which seems suitable! The four wonderful Minifigures are displayed in a section on the front of the box too which is a nice new design feature. The back shows the play features of the set.</p><p>The instructions were fine, no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is a lot of brown in this set, and a lot of dark orange which is great, especially for making you very own Geonosian landscape. We get a few nice dish pieces too which form the gun barrel and can be very useful. There are plenty of nice slopes too which could be useful. We also get two of the laser gun parts&nbsp;originally&nbsp;released with the Collectable Minifigures.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The four Minifigures are all sublime. <b>Barriss Offee</b> is great, in a new Clone Wars form. She has her dark blue hood and a short cape as well as a new head with Clone Wars eyes and a new torso which is slightly different to her previous incarnation. She comes with her blue lightsaber. <b>Commander Gree</b> is fantastic too, all of the stripes are in the right places and he even wears his&nbsp;bandoleer! He has leg printing too which is nice and puts him up to the same level as Commander Wolffe from the Republic Frigate earlier in 2011.</p><p>The two Geonosians are even better though. The regular <b>Geonosian Warrior</b> is nice, he is identical to the Geonosian Pilot from the Geonosian Starfighter but on this occasion with some lovely wings, I prefer these to the old Geonosian wings which is saying something because I love those wings!&nbsp;</p><p>The <b>Geonosian Zombie</b> is just incredible, the detail on all of the parts that make him up is lovely. The torso and legs are the same as those of the Warrior and Pilot but the predominant colour is dark grey. The head is very good, he has the empty eyes and the deep dark nostrils from which the Brain Worm emerges in the Clone Wars TV show which both look fabulous. His wings are brilliant with a weathered look as some bits have been torn over the years of crawling around in the dark underground. Both of the Geonosians hold a sonic blaster, which is made with a laser gun piece, a wheel hub and a neon-green stud. It is nice that they included a gun for the zombie, although he doesn't really need it as they never use them in the show.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly short and easy, it took me about fifteen minutes. I like how they have created the unique shape of the cannon barrel with the dish pieces and formed the grey struts which are on the cannon in the show. I quite like how the cannon is attached to the support pads as well making it very sturdy and stable.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the set is all together it looks fantastic. Everything you need for a skirmish is supplied and as I keep repeating the figures are an absolute delight. The features of the cannon are two flick fire missiles hidden underneath which fire fairly well and the ability to raise and lower the turret. A Geonosian can stand at the back and control the turret with two black levers.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In essence what I saying is get this set. It is reasonably priced in my opinion (in the UK at least) and the figures, detail and playability are all top notch. If you have the previous two Geonosis sets from the Clone Wars then this goes very well with those two and would look great in a Geonosis MOC.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

That means that the price per piece ratio is 15 cents per piece which is very good for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get 4 minifigs with this set and all of them are new. Commander Gree has some green markings on his torso, his legs and his helmet and the face is the same as the one we've seen on the other clone troopers before.</p><p>Next is the Geonosian warrior. The Geonosian warrior has some very nice details and he also has some wings which we've used to see a long time ago on the original Geonosian Starfighter set. The gun has the same mould as the gun we've seen on the space minifigs on the Collectable Minifigures theme.</p><p>The 3rd minifig is a Geonosian zombie who looks very scary. I really like the details on this figure and the wings which we get for him as well.</p><p>The last minifig we get is Barriss Offee. Offee has a the same cape mould we've seen on the LEGO Ninjago character Lloyd Garmadon - except it's navy blue this time. We also get a navy blue hood and some very cool markings on the face of this Jedi minifig. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

"Huge_Nerd","2012-04-04T06:21:56.27Z","Sonic boom!","I was very excited for this set when I first saw it and it does not disappoint.&nbsp; It makes a great complement to last year's Battle of Geonosis and Geonosian Starfighter, but also goes well paired with this year's Elite Clone/Commando Droid battle pack (if you pair them you'll have four good-guys and a cannon and four bad-guys and a cannon).<br><br>The cannon itself looks very accurate to the movie and TV shows.&nbsp; The way the barrel and muzzle of the cannon are built with various layers of discs and whatnot gives it a great look.&nbsp; The different browns and grays are balanced just right.&nbsp; The details made with the droid arms, while simple, also have a nice effect.&nbsp; Even the translucent green-yellow cones on the flick-fires look nice.&nbsp; Speaking of the flick-fires, they work well enough, but like the cannon in the Elite Clone battle pack (and the spring missile in the proton cannon droid) they shoot out of a strange place.&nbsp; Finally, the little platform for a minifigure to man the cannon is a simple, but nice touch.&nbsp; Overall, the build was satisfying and the end result looks just like it should.<br><br>The minifigs with this set are definitely a selling point.&nbsp; The Geonosian Warrior and Zombie are nicely detailed with great head sculpts.&nbsp; The wings feel nice and sturdy too.&nbsp; Lego could have easily given them both the same wings, but the more ""rotten"" looking wings on the zombie is a nice touch.&nbsp; While the guns are big and a little heavy, I have not had trouble balancing the two Geonosians on a flat surface, even with the guns pointing straight ahead. <br><br>Bariss Ofee is also a nice addition and complements Luminara from the Battle of Geonosis nicely.&nbsp; She's got a nice blue hood and short cape that make her stand out.&nbsp; Commander Gree is also nice for a clone.&nbsp; If I'm not mistaken, in Episode III he is the clone who tries to kill Yoda when Order 66 is given.&nbsp; As has been mentioned in other reviews, his green coloring and other details (like his bandolier) are spot on to his look on the Clone Wars show.&nbsp; It's nice to add his shade of green to the rainbow of clone commanders and specialty clones.<br><br>This set is priced at 20 bucks (US) and I think that is fair.

"Harmonious_Building","2013-08-01T15:46:04.583Z","Cannon canon? ","I have a friend who is pretty big into the whole Star Wars thing, and by ""pretty big into it"", I mean that he could probably recite <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"">Wookieepedia</a> in its entirety on request. I don't know if this is true of Star Wars fans in general, but he seems to take umbrage at the very existence of anything to do with the Clone Wars, and this set apparently qualifies. Now I don't really know a whole lot about this whole ""extended universe"" lark, but Geonesian Cannon looked cool, had nice-looking Minifigs, and was on sale, so why not, right?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Like I said, I'm far from being a die-hard LEGO Star Wars collector, but I do like visually interesting Minifigs and neat builds, so I couldn't help but find myself attracted Geonesian Cannon for those reasons. Clone Wars Minifigs seem to have a reputation for being a bit offbeat and perhaps a little fussy, and let me tell you that our resident Geonesians - whatever they are - certainly qualify in both characters. Of particular interest are the wings, which have to be punched out from a semi-firm plastic sheet and folded up origami-style before they can be fitted onto the Minifigs. This gives the Geonesians a certain larger-than-life appearance when they are assembled, which is actually fine considering that they are aliens.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Clone Trooper Commander Gree (he has a name?) is simple but suitably detailed, and a worthy addition to one's arsenal of troopers. Barris Offee, on the other hand, is also nicely printed, but I just can't get over the aesthetic that is particular to the heads of Minifigs from the Clone Wars subthemes, namely the larger eyes and slightly different proportions. I understand that this probably has something to do with matching the design style of the Clone Wars cartoon, but I just can't abide it in LEGO form. Yeah, I had to swap it out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cannon itself is a relatively simple but elegant build that's sturdy and looks great. There aren't really many play features other than the usual flick-fire missiles for shooting at your dog, and it strikes a good balance between having enough space for the aliens to stand on and curved pieces to keep the cannon looking pleasing. There are also a significant number of ""dark flesh"" pieces in this set, and these are somewhat rare, so if you happen to like that colour, this is a relatively cheap way to pick them up and somewhat offsets the suggested US$20 retail price.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose fans of Clone Wars sets have already jumped on this, probably multiple times to boot. I think, though, that a more general collector can certainly get a lot of joy out of this set, especially if you like ""alien"" Minifigs or have a need for round/curved pieces. Get it on discount if you can and you'll probably find a good excuse to display this somewhere, at least for a while.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"Odeinoichus","2013-11-18T21:13:13.3Z","Zombies with a Cannon!","<p><strong>Set #9491 Geonosian Cannon:</strong> This is one impressive set for the asking price, featuring four Mini-Figures and an impressively scaled cannon this set is a great addition to your Star Wars collection. And here's why.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Not much to say about the box that hasn't been pointed out by now I'd wager. Still it's a nice looking design, with Darth Maul in one corner showing that this is a 2012 Star Wars item, it names all four Mini-Figures in the set on the right hand corner and shows off the contents, revealing that this is a set with flick fire missiles as a play feature.</p>
<p>The instructions are just jammed in like with all 25$ sets, no cardboard protection, no nothing. I seriously think LEGO should reconsider how they package their instruction manuals, I've been lucky so far in that most of my purchases haven't been mangled or creased, that is to say it can happen and many find this aspect of the boxed LEGO set quite annoying.</p>
<p>Other than this complaint they're the standard LEGO instructions, easy to follow with recommended steps and of course showing that this is a numbered bag set. Build one then the other.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I don't recall any rare pieces in this set, but it does have a lot of nice dark brown and grey colored pieces. Mostly earthy tones to match the Geonosian design and color combinations. The large dish pieces are of particular note as they could be decent for MOCs. Not much else to say really.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Mini-Figures in this set are in the Clone Wars style, meaning they all share a more animated look. That doesn't detract from their level of detail however.</p>
<p>Clone Commander Gree is wearing Phase 1 Armor and has green markings, he is a standard Clone Commander and has the standard clone head from that era. He's also wielding a standard blaster piece, not much really more to say, he's decent enough.</p>
<p>Barriss Offee is the Jedi Padawan of Luminara Unduli and her Mini-Figure is an impressive looking figure. She only has a single-sided torso with her unique Jedi outfit printed on it, she also comes with a blue hood piece and a short blue cape which is a rare color. Her head and hands have a rare light green coloring to it and that about covers it. She's a nice looking Mini-Fig however a double-sided torso might have been nice to see.</p>
<p>The Geonosian Warrior and Geonosian Zombie are identical in design, but much different in coloring and print. The Warrior is a lighter color with the clear plastic wing piece attached on his neck he has a lot of detail in his print and a double-sided torso.</p>
<p>The Zombie version shares much of the detail work and the curious looking Geonosian weapon, however he has a much darker all grey color for his torso with an undead palor and clear white eyes, as well his wings have tattered patches showing that he is no longer of the living.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say the two Geonosians are the stand out Mini-Figs from this set, while I also find Barriss and Gree pretty fun looking the fact that the set includes two Geonosians (a rare Mini-Figure from the Star Wars Theme) and a Zombie version as well with excellent undead palor and print detail work, how can you go wrong with this set?</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>As noted above this model is built using the numbered bag method, Bag one includes the four Mini-Figures and the&nbsp;main&nbsp;body of the cannon while bag two involves building the legs and the rest of the weapon/projectile firing section of the cannon.</p>
<p>It is a fun and interesting design to build, this being my first exposure to the Cannon design I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. It's suitably impressive looking and also features a decent amount of ingenuity in the build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This model is faithful to the on-screen appearance of the cannon from what I can recall and features two flick-fire missiles as part of the play feature. Using technic pins and rotatable joints allows for the cannon to be positioned in any type of firing elevation. The scale with Mini-Figures is also truly impressive as it does dwarf the attacking Republic forces.</p>
<p>As a stationary gun emplacement it works, great for display on Geonosis or anywhere else you should choose. And while it is meant to represent the Clone Wars it will still look good no matter which era of the Prequel trilogy you decide to place it by.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In conclusion I am consistently amazed at the level of detail and ingenuity being placed in the 25$ set price range, while I would have preferred more zombie Geonosians in some type of battle pack to compliment the one from this set, the fact that we've gotten one at all as a Mini-Figure is truly ideal.</p>
<p>I will say this though, I find the plastic wing pieces used for the Geonosians to be a bit of a dissapointment, considering that not more than a year later at most the LEGO Group would introduce a brand new insect wing piece with Galaxy Squad I believe a better method for creating the Geonosian wings could have been achieved. Especially considering that these wings are made out of a softer plastic material and are loose in the box, meaning that if not careful they can be bent or mangled to such an extent that they won't look proper.</p>
<p>Not so much a problem for the Zombie Geonosian, the bent look of the one wing I've got due to a crease in the sheet they come attached to isn't a deal breaker as a zombie would have bent or broken wings. Still I find that this piece could have been improved upon by now, I don't like how thick the bracket area around the neck peg looks when the head is attached it detracts slightly from the overall look and impressiveness of the design.</p>
<p>Still I'd highly recommend this set, and it does work as a sort of army builder pack as Barriss and Commander Gree could be sold off via Bricklink or other related sites for those who want the Mini-Figs without buying the full set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: The box art was nothing too bad, just a Geonosis background. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and had 39 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set has four minifigures and three of them are unique to this set. First the bad guys. There are two bad guys in this set, and they are: Geonosian Warrior with wings and Geonosian Zombie with wings. Both are unique to this set. The good guys are: Clone Commander Gree who appears in three other sets and Barriss Offee - Dark Blue Cape and Hood who is unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces: There are 132 pieces in this set, but not that many rare ones. Some good ones are for example: The laser pistol and Brick 2x2 W.Bow and Knobs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: I don&#39;t actually remember much of the build because it&#39;s been a long time since I built the set. The cannon is the mani part of the set, and it&#39;s fairly easy to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: The overall set is good, but the value for the money is just not great. You just basically get a cannon and four minifigures. It&#39;s not worth $20. But otherwise the set is good. Great playability and building experience, so overall I would give this set a 4/5.&nbsp;</p>
