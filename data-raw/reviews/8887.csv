"CapnRex101","2011-12-31T15:37:23.627Z","9490 - Droid Escape","<p>In 2001 another set named Droid Escape was released, set 7106. Now we have a new and far improved version of this immortal scene from Star Wars : A New Hope to add to our collections and it has been worth the ten year wait. This set is a fun starter set I think, not only because it is fairly easy to build and shows off some excellent building techniques, but it is also from a scene which everyone will recognise. There are three&nbsp;fantastic&nbsp;new Minifigures, an R2-D2 figure which is always welcome, and the escape pod itself is a brilliant new design, very reminiscent of the one from the movie (unlike the old one) with plenty of space inside for the figures to sit. This is one set which needs the stickers, without them it doesn't look nearly as good as it does with them so for sticker haters that could be a slight snag, anyway, read on and see what you think...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is of course shares the same design as the others from this wave with the nice new design of the border and the great shot of Darth Maul in action. The picture showing off the set is on a desert background with endless sand dunes reaching off into the distance. The set is displayed with the pod crash landed in the sand and with C-3PO and R2-D2 wandering off into the desert as the Sandtroopers, apparently oblivious to the droids, hunt for the missing Death Star plans. One of the Sandtroopers is riding the speeder bike included with the set and the other is holding the small metal ring which falls off C-3PO as he escapes. The back of the box shows the play features of the set, which is basically just the removable lid on the pod and a nice blueprint picture of the escape pod from different angles, a feature common on these new boxes and one that I love.</p><p>The instructions were fine with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few decent parts in this set, most notably the large grey half cone pieces which make up the main body of the pod. There are lots of smaller cones as well in both light and dark grey which sometimes come in useful. There are also two light grey semi-circle parts which are fairly rare and interesting pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are four Minifigures in this set, <b>R2-D2</b> is a common figure, but a welcome one all the same as the scene would not be complete without him. He has the light grey head and the printing stretches all the way to the bottom of his dome unlike the old one, a vast improvement. The new <b>C-3PO</b> figure is truly awesome, with excellent levels of detail. His head is the same mould as the old one, but on this occasion there is some nice printing in his eyes, which gives him a bit more character. The torso also has a brand new design on it with the exposed power cables running up to his chest and a far more detailed socket on his front. There are many small dials and gauges on both front and back which are a nice touch. His hands are the same pearl gold as the rest of him, as are his legs, it is a shame there is no printing on the legs but never mind.</p><p>Both of the <b>Sandtroopers</b> are absolutely fantastic. They both share the same legs, torso, backpack, head and helmet which all have fantastic detail. The legs are printed with knee pads and some sand details. The torso is the same as that of the new Stormtrooper and has more of the sand weathering which looks brilliant. The head is new, black predominantly, but with an exposed face. The helmet looks great with lots of sand and scratches. The backpack is made of several pieces and nicely represents the backpacks in the film. This is where the soldiers vary, one has an orange pauldron which makes him a sergeant, and the other has a white pauldron which designates him as a regular trooper. Both are very nice with a lot of detail and a slight improvement over the earlier one which had a bit less detail. They each carry a blaster, one short and one long.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly short and very easy, but introduces us to some ingenious building techniques. The structure is very sturdy with&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;few pieces as the most of the parts that make up the body of the pod are quite big. Therefore I think this would be a good set for a young child. Personally, I like how they have attached the engines and thrusters using one of the octagonal pipe pieces at each end of the escape pod. It is also clever how they have fitted the floor inside the escape pod.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As a set, it is very nice with plenty of figures and vehicles for them. The Imperials have a good little speeder bike which is nicely designed and greatly resembles Owen Lars' speeder bike from Attack Of The Clones. A Sandtrooper can comfortably sit on the seat and hold the handlebars, even when he is wearing his rather bulky backpack. In my opinion though it would have been nicer to see the old Dewback resurrected in&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to or instead of the speeder for the troops to ride, it's a shame but you can always make your own or if you have the old Mos Eisley Cantina set then you have one already! Just to add an extra something, the designers at Lego have actually included a silver stud to represent that little ring which comes off C-3PO as I mentioned above which is nice enough, but not exactly a highlight!&nbsp;</p><p>The pod itself has several stickers on the outside including unfortunately the details on the cone pieces. Luckily they are not to hard to apply and I don't really mind stickers anyway. The pod has all ten of the engines and little thrusters on it, accurate to the film. Inside there is space for the two people (or two droids) to sit and in front of them is a control panel and some red buttons. The top half of the pod can easily be removed but is not attached very well, and occasionally falls off if you hold the vehicle upside-down or shake it around too much.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would strongly advise anyone to buy this set, surprisingly, the C-3PO figure is not the main draw for me (although he is excellent), my favourite thing about the set is the two Sandtroopers and the fantastic escape pod. As for the price, it is worth it, but I think the Geonosian Cannon (set 9491) is a better purchase as you get a bit more for your money. I would like to see it on sale for a little bit less, and for that reason as well as the lack of a Dewback, I am knocking off a point and giving this set...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"pizzahead","2012-02-11T16:17:38.403Z","Watch out for stormtroopers!","<br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box I think was well detailed, I like the new Darth Maul theme on the box and that just makes you want to buy it.&nbsp; The instructions for this set are ok, and i think Lego is trying to make there sets more take apartable.
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts of the set are ok, along with the opening part of the escape pod<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The reason I bought this is because I needed c3po and r2-d2 but the minifigures were very cool. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The building experience went swell, no mistakes, very easy. <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's very cool and I've always wanted a escape pod, although the little pieces on the engine fall off every time so watch out for that.&nbsp; I like the open part of the set, it's easy to take apart and it's just cool.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Over all i think the set, it's price, it's minifigures, and the Darth Maul box theme (Don't forget) are pretty awesome although at first I wasn't really satisfied with what I picked out of the store, but then when I was building it I felt like it was worth it after all. <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,5,2,4
"legoreviewer778","2012-01-07T05:32:15.713Z","Worth Getting I Reckon, Just Don't Rush Now...","This set, is thus far one of the only Star Wars 2012 sets in existence. LEGO decided to release them a bit later than usual, but this one is available as of right now on pre-order.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Now onto the build. Yeah pretty unusual actually... but none the less it was really engaging and the whole time it actually felt you were in that scene. Also, don't forget that this set has completely new figures-for around $20USD is not a bad deal at all. I know the fact that there are lots of great sets out there at about the same price range, but this one is also something to consider as a collectors item. The instructions aren't available as far as I'm aware, so can't include a link to that, sorry.</div><div><br></div><div>The figures are pretty awesome. The Sand Troopers are definitely a big step up compared to the originals, so great job on that LEGO. I mean it actually looks like they've been through a Sand Storm and stuff... rather than just making a representation without any detail. It's almost like a soup with no salt, so I think they did great. Their faces are pretty fantastic as well, almost like the Clone Army Customs (CAC) faces for mocs they use, but similar to the original Jango Fett's face, but in skin colour. Their shoulder pads are also new, which is really awesome and they each have there own, so I like how they made them different! The C-3PO is also really great and his torso is definitely much more detailed than the previous version-considering the wires and cables they printed, it almost looks like a new figure! Unfortunately I wasn't expecting this, but there is no difference in R2 what so ever, so it would of been nice to see a new design. Again, sorry, but LEGO hasn't put up the instructions on Brick Link, so can't include a link to that.</div><div><br></div><div>Will now talk about the set. The set isn't exactly the greatest... it's mainly for the figures if you ask me. Yeah I will admit that the set is pretty cool and all, and the escape pod design is rather cool. Kind of like the newer escape pods, eg. 7964, it's the kind of stretched out design, with the extra detail. The lid is almost identical, but again the interior detail is a whole lot different. The 2 figures that are meant to go in there fit in there fine, no problem at all. I would also like to mention that I like the way you put in R2, he attaches from his lower part of the body, which is quiet clever actually! This set is not available on Lugnet either, so again sorry for that.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, let's start with the speeder. It's kind of rushed... but I guess it's okay and it's only designed for one mini figure. So I don't know, it just seems thrown in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The top and the bottom both require a sticker that you can stick on. There are also some smaller stickers, which are also fine. The back and the exterior provides really good detail and the engines do almost resemble the one in the movie!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The inside, they provided a seat for both figures. There are also some controls. The way it works, is C-3PO sits on the front and R2 sits behind him and the lid just goes over the top.</div><div><br></div><div>PROS:</div><div>- Fun to build, even considering how small it is</div><div>- Good to play with and recreate the movie scene with</div><div>- Fairly accurate to episode IV</div><div>- Great printing for the Sand Troopers, everything on them is new!</div><div><br></div><div>CONS:</div><div>- A bit small for $20...</div><div>- They could of made a new R2</div><div><br></div><div>At the end, I think this is a great set. It's kind of hard to judge, mainly for how small it is, but just to tell you, I don't really regret getting this set at all, I actually love it! But I think for $20, maybe they should of made a small hut or something from Tatooine, just to make it worth the value, but everything else is great!</div><div><div><br></div><div>If you want more of my opinion on this set, go to my You Tube channel, it's where you can watch my reviews on all sets I own: http://www.youtube.com/user/legoreviewer778</div><div><br></div><div>If this review was helpful to you, press ""yes""!<br><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div></div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"tkettle9719","2012-02-09T08:16:03.37Z","Welcome to Tatooine!","<p>I got this set for myself from the pre-orders, and am extremely pleased with the set overall, with all of the minifigures, the escape pod, and the little Sand-Speeder-Bike. All of it is fantastic. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The escape pod is beautifully designed; compact, but with beauty. The top lid is also quite nice, though insecure.<br></li><li>-Minifigures: all of them are excellent, down to the new R2, the exclusive new 3P0, and the Sandtroopers, my personal favorite.<br></li><li>-The speeder bike is nice and compact, and a really nice little addition to an already excellent set. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Stickers again: there are six of them in here, and they all annoyed me so when I discovered their presence. <br></li><li>-The white bits on the escape pod also look a bit out-of-place here to me. <br></li><li>-Also, I wish that the pauldrons had some sand evidence here, so as to emphasize detail. <br></li></ul>
<p>This set is great, though the flaws are a bit bigger. I also wish that this came with maybe a Dewback, but I honestly don't want to pay an additional 5 bucks to do so. This set is still great, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the old one, or anyone who's a mad minifigure enthusiast. <br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Nesquik","2012-11-16T09:13:12.653Z","""I think I'm going to regret this...""","<div>137 pieces for the Lego RRP of twenty pounds isn't exactly an earth-shattering deal, but in tandem with TLG's clever product line, this is a very easy way to get four good minifigures and two small models.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And that is likely the way TLG consider products such as this; the build[s] within the set are not as important as the minifigures, which are what many die-hard fans want. As such, if it's playability that you're thinking of, then put your money towards something else, because there's little to get excited about in 9490. Both the Escape Pod and the Sandspeeder are excellent little models, but it's difficult to maintain a story when the Escape Pod (A) had such little screen-time, and (B) has no significance other than to be buried in sand or to be propelled into orbit. The interior of the pod would seem to exist purely to build up the value of the product, because it has little relation to the Escape Pod from the movie. Obviously I can understand the design hurdles that would need to be overcome, but it's good to see that the engines/funnels are so well thought-out.</div><div><br></div><div>The Sandspeeder is a nice mini-build, but again, just looks out of place without a creative solution for the sand dunes. In fact, this Sandspeeder wasn't even in the original movie. I won't complain too much as it's actually a good looking bike, and was most likely based on original production artwork/concept drawings. Either way, it definitely fits into the Star Wars universe.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But it's the minifigures really steal the show. R2-D2 has cropped up numerous times and this is still the cheapest way to get him in a Lego set, while C-3PO, although following a similar trend, now sports a new print on his torso. It contains the wiring around his 'belly' and as such looks a lot more authentic. In addition, his eyes now have yellow iris spots so that they glow similarly to how they do in the movies.</div><div><br></div><div>Our two 'Sandtroopers' are unique to this product; they have sand stuck to their helmets and body. Great! They also have the backpacks, weapons, and one has a metallic artefact that represents the ""Look, droids!"" line from the movie. A nice little touch.</div><div><br></div><div>In all, if you manage to find this product a bit cheaper (in my estimate, a fair price would be £15.99 at the most), then it's definitely worthy of a purchase when you consider the saving involved - it has four excellent minifigures and a really nice 'looking' Escape Pod that is most likely suited to display rather than play. The build requires six stickers, but these enhance the look of the pod greatly.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-08-24T10:14:40.583Z","LEGO Star Wars - Droid Escape Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 137 pieces and it is 20 USD. That means that the price per 
piece ratio is 15 cents per piece which is a really good value for a set 
like this.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get 4 awsome minifigs with this set. 3 of them have a new design. First we get R2-D2 who hasn't been updated. The figure is always good to have though. The next figure we get is C-3PO. 3PO looks much better than the other two versions we got in the past. I really love the details which LEGO has given this figure. We also get some nice printings on the back as well. The last figures we get with this set are the sand troopers. Both figures look way similar - except for the pauldron. The details on the armor is just amazing and we also get some printings on the face which is epic.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/9490-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The set comes with a speeder bike and an escape pod. The speeder isn't accurate to the movied but it's there. The main attraction in here is the escape pod itself. The top comes off very easily and you can put the minifigs in there very nice and easy. We also get a nice SNOT build (<b>S</b>tuds <b>N</b>ot <b>O</b>n <b>T</b>op). The details of the escape pod are much better than the oiriginal version 7106 which came out in 2001.<br></span></p>

"Shistavanen_brick","2012-03-23T06:41:51.63Z","""Look, Sir, droids...""","<div>I've been circling this set for a while and even though it's new and all, I actually found it to a reduced price and took my chance and got it. Is it worth the buzz? In one way...yes, but there might be a slight disappointment coming over you once you've built it. Not much, but I will get to that in the end.</div><div><br></div><h4>Instructions.</h4><div>You just got to love the new box-design with the Zabrak Darth Maul. It really make the boxes of 2012 to stand out. The instructions are also very straight forward and makes it an easy build. In the back of the 1 booklet you get there was a short comic about the droids landing on Tatooine.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div>Can you believe it, we are getting REAL sandtroopers! It's just grand in so many ways. All are new designs except for the little astromech also known as R2. LEGO has made a great job with the attention to detail on all three of the re-designed ones.</div><div><br></div><div><b>R2-D2.</b> Just the plain and regular R2 without anything new to him. Compared to the other ones in the set it feels like he's a bit left out. Hopefully he won't hold a grudge!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Sandtroopers</b>. They are just a wonderful addition to your collection. Take my word for it, these guys RULE Tatooine and have the sandcovered uniforms to prove it! Uniforms are nicely sandsprinkled and I guess I love the helmets the most. Both have the new heads with an actual face instead of the all black head, which is nice. Each have their own shoulder pauldron (1 black, 1 orange) and a backpack. Those were very simple but look great as a whole. As a result they get a bit tail-heavy and can need some balancing. Two blasters are included. I hope LEGO will make some new weaponry for the future, though these will also serve good for their purpose.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C-3PO.</b> At last the protocol droid gets his chords on the right spot. This is<i> the</i> C-3PO to have (unless you have the shiny one). The torso is much more detailed than before and I believe his eyes are different too. They look a bit more bright and alert than previous versions. The colour is more fitting too, in my opinion, than the pearl gold. This <i>is</i> the droid you are looking for.</div><div><br></div><h4>The build.</h4><div><b>Escape pod.</b> It was rather interesting to see its shape becoming more and more like a pod during the build. It's by no means a hard build but you sort of enjoy the simple steps. It has a good and easy opening function where you just take the top off to place the droids inside. Then there are 4 engine or rocket pieces in the pack of the pod for some steering and playability action. The stickers were annoying and a pain to place correctly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sandspeeder bike.</b> This might not be the best or safest way to travel through the Jundland Wastes (not that anyone in their right mind would do that...but...) but it sure would be better than walking. It appears to be a simpler version of the speeder bike. It was a very quick build and I haven't decided whether I like it or not. To make a set they needed to include something more than just the pod and some minifigures, I get that. Going back on my first thought, that they should have included a dewback instead, I realize that would have increased the price for this set immensly. So maybe the sandspeeder bike is the better option? I'm not entirely convinced but I will let it pass while I continue to think about what it should have been instead...</div><div><br></div><h4>The model.</h4><div>I think the entire scene looks nice and of course the minifigs are just fantastic. However, it feels a bit small once you have built it. Why am I feeling there is something missing here? The pod is nice, minifigs too, the sandspeeder bike is ok but where is the satisfaction buzz? I am happy about the set as a whole, but I can't shake the feeling that something is missing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to get this anyway. What disturbs me might not disturb others as much, and you really need some sandtroopers. The pod is rather cool and could be used for an interior display if you are building some kind of hangar. Either that or using the parts for other creations.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>The sandtroopers are just totally ACE!</li><li>C-3PO is the droid you are looking for.</li><li>You get a good escape pod.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Might not be worth the original price tag - considering what you get.</li><li>Annoying stickers.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

<p>The box is 2012 box design for star wars sets and has Darth Maul on it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The parts are not very intresting except the cone shape pieces are not to common.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;We have the usual&nbsp; R2-D2 with the gray dome, two Sandtroopers with new torso design and with dirt splotted on their armor (wich is currently&nbsp;exclusive to this set) last but not least C-3po with a new torso design (Even though I HATE&nbsp;the new torso design, it just looks to cartoonish compared to the old one)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The build is very easy and is nothing challenging.(great for beginners)</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Overall the model is very sturdy and is more movie accurrate than the 2001 version.&nbsp;And this model has better details on the back like the exhaust pipes. (There are stickers in this set sadly) you can lift the top and their is room for both 3-po and R2 to be seated together.&nbsp; Their is a small swoop bike included for the Sandtroopers.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - Minifigures. I have to say the coolest things about this set, in my humble opinion, are the minifigures. C-3PO got an upgrade and is very detailed. He's got colored wires on his abdomen and his eyes also look like their lit-up. The Sandtroopers are amazing! They look hand-painted due to the high level of detail. These two are my new favorite minifigures. Artoo, however, remains the same.<br></li><li>Pro 2 - Set detail. For being a small set you can tell the designer(s) studied the reference material. The shape, thruster bank, and sensors on the top all match the movies.</li><li>Pro 3 - Playability. The droids fit well into the pod and the hatch goes on and off easily.</li><li>Pro 4 - Swoop. The Imperial's vehicle is labeled a ""speeder bike"" but it's a ""swoop."" Still a cool addition to the set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - The only con I can think of is the lack of a dewback. That's what the Sandtroopers had in the movies (well the re-released version) so it would be sweet to have one for this set.<br></li></ul>I've mentioned this in my other recent reviews, but it looks like the Legos folks are really doing their homework when it comes to using movie reference material to design their sets. This one continues that trend. This is a really cool set and if you have no other reason to get it, get it for the Sandtroopers. Nice work on them, Lego!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"zipsforbananas","2012-07-28T10:31:14.82Z","All about the minifigures!","<p>2012 saw a good selection of differently sized sets, some for the serious buyer, some medium sized, and some nice small ones like this one. Consequently it's hard to criticise it, as for the price you can't expect too much. And actually, thinking of it as if it's a jumbo-sized battle pack it's actually pretty good, and faithful to the films!</p><p>The <b>escape pod</b> is okay, and the more I think about what it was meant to be the more impressed I am. The pieces are very good, with little rocket boosters attached nicely, and the awkward conical shape is converted into a comfortable space for the two droids well. On the downside, I'm not as allergic to stickers as some, but these are a pig to apply evenly given their size and the curved surfaces you're sticking them to; the four around the 'waist' are horribly awkward. The set looks like it's made for young children, but I imagine most adults would have trouble with them! Considering that all it is is an escape pod it's pretty good, but because it's only an escape pod will it ever be very playable?</p><p>The <b>speeder</b> also falls somewhere between initial disappointment and quiet satisfaction. It's not authentic so I was never going to be happy, but other than a dewback I don't suppose there was anything that the sandtroopers could have been given! It's got some nice pieces and is pleasantly reminiscent of the Endor speeder bikes, and provides a bit of needed swooshability to the set.</p><p>Of course, the <b>figures</b> are the centrepiece, and getting four of them is nice. R2 is the newer grey-headed version, and all the others are brand new. C-3PO's new squareness doesn't look as good as the last more round-looking version in my opinion, but all the other changes are a vast improvement; his eyes are finally printed, his waist has printed colour wires, and he's a better shade of gold. And the two sandtroopers are truly excellent; the rebreathers are the same as the last incarnation, but everything else is fantastic! They are marvellously weathered, their legs are printed (which doesn't look OTT when combined with the weathering) and the shoulder pads are large, well coloured and detailed. And I quite like the little gold piece that I think is meant to be the, ""Look sir, droids!"" moment, even if there's no way it fell off R2 or 3PO!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great figures, with the newer designs being better in almost every way</li><li>Affordable, and a good selection of bricks for the size of the set</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Limited playability</li><li>Stickers are very difficult to apply evenly</li></ul>
<p>A good little set with great minifigures, although I'd prefer a less angular Threepio. Beyond that the pod is nice, but as nice as it is it doesn't ever quite deliver. I'd say if you could source the sandtroopers on their own you'd be doing just as well as if you bought it. It's certainly not a disaster though, if you did get it you might not be thrilled but you wouldn't regret it. Average marks all round!</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4

"aliasangelalias","2013-02-22T15:44:39.34Z","A pretty neat set and somewhat fun","<p>Here is a budget set with 4 mini figs and 2 vehicles. It is a great set for a child but for an adult, it is a set to army built your display or diorama.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box art is very standard to this product series.<br>Simple like every other instruction book.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>If you own other big sets, this is nothing unusual. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>3PO has extra paint apps on stomach section compare to the Tenative IV 3PO.<br>R2 is a repack.<br>The Sandtroopers are the draw to this set and their weapons are fantastic.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fun for kids and simple for an adult.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once it is done... if you have kids, they will be all over this. <br>For an adult, you will most likely leave it on the display and never touch it again... or you might use it as spare on MOC. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>LEGO pricing strategy is quite strange to say the least.&nbsp; For a mid tiny box set, $20 USD is the best you going to get for 4 figs and 2 vehicles. 137 pieces doesn't seem a lot but at least your child will appreciate this set and that's money well spend.&nbsp; For adult, you might just want to buy the Sandtrooper mini-figures loose to add into your collection.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-31T15:59:03.727Z","Droid Escape Take Two","<p><strong>Set #9490 Droid Escape: </strong>Like Ewok Attack before it LEGO re-visits the iconic scene from A New Hope in this set Droid Escape, where Artoo and Threepio escape from the Tantive IV and much like Ewok Attack before it LEGO has managed to improve upon the original set quite nicely. The only thing missing to make this set perfect would be a re-release of the hard to get Dewback creature, still we can expect that to show up again eventually I'd wager.</p>
<p>As someone who owns both versions allow me to point out the improvements that this 2012 re-design set offers compared to the original.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>First of all the box is much larger as the set offers up more pieces than the original. The price point has gone up at the same time so the box allows us to see the set, it is a&nbsp;2012 LEGO Star Wars set which shares the uniform design of a white box with dark blue on the right hand side and Darth Maul in the top right hand corner.</p>
<p>The instructions share this design choice and they are really great fun with some cross-promotions of the early 2012 wave, a Mini-Figure checklist and a small comic book style image showcasing the set on one page. I'm pretty impressed with both the box and instruction manual... I do wish there was more protection for the sticker sheet and manual though.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set doesn't offer much in the way of rare pieces or rare colours, there is a large Technic gear piece and new pauldrons for the new Mini-Figures included in the set. This set also has a pair of round plates with octagonal bars in white, a favorite piece for MOCers, the large sections of the escape pod are pretty useful and fun looking too.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set improves upon the original Droid Escape set by including 2 extra Mini-Figures, so you get the famous droids and a pair of brand new Sandtroopers.</p>
<p>The Sandtroopers are pretty much identical in their printing, with dirt/sand encrusted torso prints (double-sided) and new leg printing as well as sand on their standard helmets they look great. They also have two new cloth pauldron pieces for ranks and some back brackets to mount the buildable Sandtrooper backpacks on. One carries the long blaster rifle while the other uses the standard blaster common amongst Stormtroopers. They also share the same head with the balaclava revealing the mini-figure head underneath. New standard of all Imperial Troopers.</p>
<p>C-3PO is a lovely looking pearl gold colour, this is the first 3PO I've gotten in some time actually and I think the new colours improve on his design considerably. I'm not sure if the print is new, but it does look accurate to how he appears in all LEGO Media forms.</p>
<p>R2-D2 is the version with the grey dome rather than the older white dome which came in the first Droid Escape. I honestly don't know which one is more accurate, all I know for sure is the improved print detailing on the newer R2 looks pretty impressive.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Building this version of the escape pod is still just as fast and easy, it uses newer techniques and works great as an update to the pod. This one matches closer the version on screen, it is bigger too and offers a bit more space to fit the figures in. It's also less breakable, the older escape pod falls apart during the build much easier than this one.</p>
<p>This set has two numbered bags, one is the escape pod the other is a small speeder bike and the Mini-Figures.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>As I noted above this model works much better as an escape pod from the Tantive IV than it's predecessor, the one thing that the original has going for it over this one is printed pieces. Here you use stickers for the detail work, while the original had two printed parts that offered all the same details, if you aren't a fan of sticker details and prefer your bricks printed you might want to track down the original. I'd say this one is a bit better though even with the sticker details because it looks more accurate and there's more details on the interior of the pod.</p>
<p>The original pod was just a big open space to put your mini-figures of R2 and 3PO in, this one actually has spaces to seat (or stick) them and also has actual controls for flying.</p>
<p>The speeder bike is a nice little side-build for the Sandtrooper to ride; the overall design of it reminds me more of a swoop bike from Shadows of the Empire than the more familiar speeder bikes we saw on Endor. It works nice as an extra build for the Imperials though.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this is a really great improvement on the original Droid Escape set, the escape pod having a larger frame to work with and greater detail in the design is a huge improvement. The inclusion of some Sandtroopers works great too, and the only thing that could rate it higher would be if LEGO had given us a Dewback again, since we haven't seen one in a set since around 2004 or so.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this one for fans of this scene from the films. The improvements work wonders and it does make for a nice troop builder set since it is priced so nicely. Of course you'll have a ton of 3PO and R2 with your little Sandtrooper army, I hope we see more of them in future sets because these new printed Sandtroopers work great and would look awesome in an actual Battle Pack.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
