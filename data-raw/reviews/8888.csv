"Irresistance","2012-07-04T03:55:43.237Z","Very well suited to its audience, easy to build!","The moment Friends Lego's showed up on this website I knew it was going to be a hit for my (then) 4-year old daughter. We set about buying some of the sets, such as the beauty shop, the cafe, the car and this one. This one of course is by far the coolest, although in pure value-for-money terms the Cafe comes close.<div><br></div><div>I got this one in an official Lego store, 70 quid, exactly as RRP. When I got back home my daughter could not wait to start building it, and she sat at it for two hours straight, building it entirely by herself. She enjoyed it <b>that</b> much. She's five now, but both me and my wife were amazed at the attention span that she could muster. So yes, this can be built by a five year old, although slowly. The only thing I did was search bricks for her, I guess this helped with keeping the attention focused :)</div><div><br></div><div>The house is full of well-decorated elements, including a kitchen, bathroom and living room. Of all the rooms, the bedroom is the least interesting, as it does not really feature anything aside of a bed and some minor furniture. But that aside it's a pleasure to look at and play with.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the surprises was the very elaborate garden area that comes with swing, barbecue and a wide variety of plants. Although I am not a fan of stickers myself, the ones that come in this set are reasonably OK. However, when you attach the ones that go on panels, makes sure that you dont make the mistake I made by putting them too close to the edge - the first ""row"" of the panel is hidden behind a pillar, meaning that in such case a part of the sticker (shower/kitchen) is obscured. But hey, that's details.</div><div><br></div><div>And, last but not least, this appears to be the ONLY set that contains a male character, so I now also exist in her Friends Lego universe ;) Overall, I would say it is very well worth the money, as it offers a large array of playing options. Basically, its a bit like a doll-house, but then made of Lego's. We'll be adding a garage to it soon, and perhaps expand the Friends hood with a custom build on the basis of another Cafe set. Once I'm finally allowed to buy ever more Lego's again ;)</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"MesaVerde","2014-11-16T03:15:48.897Z","Best LEGO House I've Built","<p>Great detailed set that exemplifies the wonder and creativity of LEGO bricks.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice size and very colorful box. The box shows off the set and makes you feel like your money has been well spent.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is full of detailed parts. We are treated to many types of flowers (including roses), kitchen equipment, and a colorful assortment of plates and bricks. Eye candy!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minidolls are provided. As I am a traditional configured fan the dolls do not interest me. My 4 year old appreciates them and they are a good size to play with and handle for the little hands.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The details of the house kept the build fresh. Many steps we&#39;re dedicated to assembling the details and furniture like the bed, tiled bathroom, and landscaped grounds. The house went together fast. Each room and part of the set had a unique feel yet integrated well with the other pieces of the build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished house looks nice and presents a complete detailed home. I have several Creator houses but none come close to this set in terms of detail or playability. The color pallet and attention to things like shower doors, refridgerator with opening doors, bedroom vanity and even a vegetable garden make for a pinnacle residence in LEGOLAND.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The Friends theme and this set are a breathe of fresh air. The details and fun colors make this an attractive set. The price is also fair. The open back may distract some but the emphasis on play and all the positives of the set easily make up for the minor deficencies. Pickup this set for you or your child.&nbsp;</p>
