<ul><li>Nice colourful design with plenty of parts in new colours<br></li><li>Minifig compatable cooking utensils</li><li>New printed cash register slope brick<br></li></ul>

"baylego","2012-01-01T17:22:58.543Z","Excellent Parts Pack","<p>I got this set today as soon as I saw the display. When I first saw the set, I thought that it was a damaged box, but I quickly realized that the front of the box was purposely bowed outwards. With a box that made such an interesting first impression, I knew that the set's contents had to be just as unique.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); "">The Minidoll</span></p><p>A lot of people are unhappy about how Lego did not stick to the standard mini figure model for this series of sets, but I think that the new minidolls are a good addition to these sets. The photos online lead me to believe that they were a good amount larger than a standard minifigure. In person, they seem to be about the same size as a minifigure, just much skinnier. Their hair fits perfectly on minifigures and vice versa, so these figures should at least be kept for their hair.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); "">The Parts</span></p><div>I bought this set for the multitude of special parts it contains.

"beegeedee","2012-01-26T06:23:08.67Z","Nice set, steep price","<p>I've not been in any rush to get any of the other friends sets after getting one of the small ones as an experiment. However when I saw City Park Cafe on sale it was a no-brainer. As a new set, getting it 1/3 off is a bargain.</p>The build is straight-forward and nothing too involved and while there is no roof to the cafe and some may not like this, it does make it easier to play with.
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The 16x16 plate and 16x8 plates in the new colour, whatever that colour is<br></li><li>The forks, knifes and plates<br></li><li>the new flowers and cakes</li><li>The mini-doll figures and their hair</li><li>Nice set of bricks and new colours<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>For full price it is overpriced in the UK/Ireland<br></li><li>would be nice if the mini figure/doll legs moved independently<br></li><li>Stickers<br></li></ul>
<p>As a set, it is bright and colourful. The new colours can make for an interesting MOC and that's the main reason I bought this set.</p><p>The US price is reasonable but the UK price means it is almost the equivalent of $47, (Euro price similarly inflated) and not worth that but if you can get it for around the 20 GBP price mark it is definitely worth a look.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"AETerry","2013-03-20T19:16:09.02Z","City Park Cafe Review","<p>This set was gotten for my daughter at her 6th birthday and at the time it represented the largest set in her collection of LEGO Friends. So much of my reviews will be based upon her response and reactions to this set.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box of course is brightly colored for the Friends theme and has concave ends along with clear pictures and illustrations of just what all is to be found in the set.<br><br>The instruction booklet follows LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations for each stage of building. Along with towards the end that there's a catalog listing of all the parts in the set and Customer Service Number for any problems with the set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In all there's 222 pieces along with some extras and a sheet of stickers for placing on certain bricks during building.</p><p>The most notable and exciting pieces are the accessories in the way of 3 sets of knives and forks, spatula, plates and cupcake holders. Those really make the Cafe seem to have more depth in what you can pose the minidolls doing. There is also a pie piece previously only available with the Collectible Minifigure clown.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two minidolls that come with this set. Andrea and Stephanie. My daughter likes them well enough like the other minidolls though it took her awhile to warm up to the idea that these were more like dolls and not minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Luckilly when building this set the first time, all the parts come in numbered bags that you don't need to open until you reach different stages of construction. There is also the fact that many features of the Cafe are ""mini builds"" and can break down the long process of building the entire set. <br><br>Because this was a first for my daughter, she was getting easily frustrated at many points with missing steps, needing my help with stickers while at the same time upset that I'd point out she'd miss something.</p><p>But she did get it built and she was happy with her success at building the Cafe and playing with it for hours.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall my daughter loves this set and I'm happy for her at her accomplishment at building what for her was one of the largest sets she's built at the time. Following in her Mom's footsteps, she's kept all the pieces together and displays it on her dresser when she's not playing with it. It's a good set and my daughter declares she wants to get more stores like this to build a LEGO city with her Friends sets. I didn't make any promises to her but told her we'd look into it and try.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T13:15:23.137Z","Join the Friends at the Cafe","<p>Set #3061 City Park Cafe: We have reached a Milestone for me, here on Brickset I have reviewed previously 399 LEGO Sets, a number which includes Video Games and a Keychain amongst other things. This does not mark my 400th Set Review for the site, but it does mark my 400th review period, and so I chose to purchase this set at retail for the sole sake of representing my 400th Review.</p>
<p>I have also opted to change the design and formatting of my review this time, typically I have simply typed up a long wall of text, which some might not find very helpful. Today I am going to try using the Eurobricks Style template for my review. This is a fun and fun to build LEGO set, I chose it out of all the sets I had on my small list for this review because of that factor. Now that I've explained that, let us proceed onto the review itself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>I rarely before have spoken about the LEGO Boxes, there are some that have issues with empty space, a trait LEGO has been trying to correct in recent years by cutting down on the sizes of the box.</p>
<p>The presentation has also changed, LEGO Boxes these days offer a great look at the set with functionilty and impressive photos. The City Park Cafe set is no exception to this practice, the box does it's best to draw the eye, the front shows a nice image of the completed set in a play style, the design includes the Friends logo, the Friends group shot in the upper right hand corner and a picture of the Mini-Dolls included with this set.</p>
<p>The back shows off other sets in the line, one for each Friend not included with this set, as well as further showing off the functions of the Cafe. There is a lot of empty space inside this box though, as my instruction booklet can attest to. It got a bit curled up unfortunately, the contents of the book are your typical level of LEGO Instructions. Great, easy to read, detailing everything that needs to be done in step-by-step methods.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this set are varied, great uses for them are in abundance and the accessories new to the Friends Theme are also quite welcome additions for MOCers, some of the parts will be stickered during the build, indeed for some reason this set had two sticker sheets inside, both identical. Perhaps in case one is damaged, or perhaps an extra in case you wanted to add on to the model itself with your existing parts to make it a fully closed in building.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great colors and pieces though, you've got some rich reds and bright pinks and the first light teal/blue colored baseplates ever offered by LEGO. There are also the new cupcake wrappers pieces, the clear transparent bubble used for the bubblegum machine and some great looking windows.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Two Mini-Dolls are included with the set, Marie who is unique to the Cafe and Andrea.</p>
<p>Andrea I've reviewed before, both in the Bunny House and Stage sets she came in last year, this version of Andrea still has the same colored hairpiece and eyes (green), this time however she is dressed in a orange top with musical note pattern and a light teale colored skirt (not the same tone as the baseplates) as well as purple shoes. She looks great and is a nice alternate costume choice for the character.</p>
<p>Marie is the Waitress/Cashier/Proprietress of the Cafe, judging by her uniform, she's dressed in a pink sleevless top with a slightly different toned, yet still matching, pink skirt and shoes. Her hairpiece appears to be unique, it's blonde and it prooves something. In other reviews I have mentioned that Stephanie's blonde hair feels pretty cheap, plasticy/rubbery and notiecably of lesser quality than the other Friends Mini-Dolls. I thought it might be the color choice used for that piece, now that I have another blonde hairpiece though I can safely say that Stephanie's hairpiece mold is the culprit.</p>
<p>Marie's blonde hair feels just as consistent as the others, so I'd have to say that Stephanie's hairpiece is just a bad mold choice or casting. Both Mini-Dolls in this set are great, and look great to be added to your Friends Mini-Doll collection.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set features three numbered bags, the instructions indicate that bag #1 &amp; 2 are both used at the same time, so I'm a bit curious to know what made LEGO decide to use three numbered bags if two of them are used at the same time instead of just using two numbered bags.</p>
<p>The first two bags are used to build the exterior patio and outer walls for the set, the third bag fills in the interior of the Cafe with all the seats, cash register, oven and things. It's a pretty solid build honestly, despite the finished model being a bit more of a facade than a full four-walled building, however it shouldn't be too difficult for the target age range to follow and finish by themselves.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished product is gorgeous looking, we'll go step-by-step with each aspect of the model.</p>
<p>First off is the un-attached patio section, using 1 8x16 baseplate you build a table, two stools and a partial fenced in area with flower pot. This small patio is not attached to the front of the cafe in any way, which some might consider to be a negative for the model, personally... While I don't believe this is entirely a bad thing, as it makes for easier modifying or transporting the set across the room or house, it isn't very aesthetically pleasing. However I'm not sure how LEGO could have designed the set to actually build everything and attach all three baseplate sections without hindering the look of the Cafe itself.</p>
<p>Moving on to the second section of the cafe, which is pretty much the Cafe period, this aspect of the model is highly impressive. When I first started collecting the Friends Line I knew I wanted this set because of the way it looked overall, the building itself is not fully closed in, the front and sides of the building/walls are there. But the rear of the building is missing in favor of being fully open for playability, for older collectors who prefer closed in modular building styles this could be unfavorable. However the children who enjoy playing inside their sets without having to remove several sections just to reach their hands into it means this is a very good design choice and LEGO has always been about functionality and play patterns first and foremost.</p>
<p>The exterior walls look great with big open windows so that Mini-Dolls and Mini-Figures can see inside of it, or be seen from the people inside. The front section includes a large flower box with three stems full of red, white and yellow flowers and the sign with the big awning/sloped roof design is just all around fun. (Despite the use of a sticker for the big Cafe sign instead of printed material.)</p>
<p>Inside you have a lot of fun little elements, there's a table with two&nbsp;benches where you can put the printed orange juice carton and a plate with a Krabby Pattie on it. (Actually just an ordinary Hamburger.) A smaller round table for condiments with a salt shaker, pepper shaker, mustard and ketchup dispensers. An interesting series of mini-builds give you an ice-cream dispensing machine, a display area where you place the small clown's pie piece, and a cash register. And of course you also have the sink and stove area where you can keep a lot of the accessories, forks, knives, frying pan and spatula, mixing bowl and cooking pan.</p>
<p>This model is just all around impressive, with some excellent potential for MOCing into a much bigger cafe with a fully enclosed wall and removeable roof, for those of you older fans who enjoy that sort of tinkering. It's a fully functional and playable model for the children as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In conclusion I'd have to say this is a really great set from the LEGO Friends line, something that LEGO Town enthusiasts will remember from the heyday of the older Town Theme, before it became City, the design is really reminiscent of some of those older sets with a lot of playability, functionality and great new accessories and printings (including the orange juice carton and the cash register.) The use of stickers for details on the window, like the big ice cream float sign, and the open sign on the door isn't to everyone's taste, however that is the beatuy of the set. All of the stickers are perfectly optional if you prefer not to use them, with possible exception to the big Cafe sign itself.</p>
<p>The one I purchased also has a Gold Seal sticker from the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio saying it won the Best TOY Award, which to me seems to proove that the LEGO Friends line and the City Park&nbsp;Cafe in particular really have done a lot to offer up the best of LEGO's play pattern in the past year. One odd thing though is that the broom accessory is left hanging on the outside of the building, I find that an odd placement. The Gumball machine is a nice element as well, I strongly recommend this set for the parts, the Mini-Dolls, the accessories and everything it's just that good.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
