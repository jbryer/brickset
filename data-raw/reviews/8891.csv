<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Interesting parts</li><li>Great accessories and play features</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers.&nbsp; I mean, I know that mirror prints for bricks is cost prohibitive, but I still miss the old days of printed parts.&nbsp; My daughter could care less, she doesn't remember a Lego before the DSS.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, this is a great little set with lots and lots of play features.&nbsp; Even as an AFOL, as I was helping my daughter build the set, I would see parts and colors and go, 'Wow, this would make a really cool . . .' over and over.&nbsp; Five bricks all the way; if you can find this, grab it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
