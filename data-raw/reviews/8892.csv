 I was really impressed with this cute little set. A ton of accessories,
 and built on a more realistic scale for play than a lot of the recent 
regular releases from Lego. Her tree house is almost the same size as 
the Harry Potter Burrow, which is supposed to be the home for half a 
dozen people. I love the idea of getting more people into Legos and this
 could be the trick, with its new colors, slightly cartoony pieces and 
lower price points. I will be checking out the other sets in the series!</font></font></p><p><br></p><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><font size=""5""><font size=""3"">&nbsp;</font></font><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SRcv-HOd9GM/TxLipUQ2heI/AAAAAAAABzE/wtO7qYbznFk/s1600/Friends+004.JPG"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SRcv-HOd9GM/TxLipUQ2heI/AAAAAAAABzE/wtO7qYbznFk/s320/Friends+004.JPG"" height=""239"" border=""0"" width=""320""></a>  </p></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><font size=""5""><font size=""3""><font size=""5""><b>4/5</b></font></font></font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><font size=""5""><font size=""3""><font size=""5""><b>&nbsp;</b></font></font></font>   </p><div style=""text-align: left;""><p><font size=""5""><font size=""3""><font size=""5""><b><font size=""3"">Notes: </font></b><font size=""3"">Slightly larger than a normal Lego Minifigure, the Friends line is

<p>When I got this set, I built it right away. This set has rare pieces such as the flowers and butterflies, pets, milk carton, plate, and 2 diamonds, but the shirt on Olivia wore away after a few months.&nbsp;</p>

"Branko","2013-02-25T22:17:59.22Z","Oh so cute!","<p>This is my first step into the Friends theme and I am impressed. I already knew that the key for Friends was 'accessories' but I did not appreciate that also translate to detail. This set is completely filled with the cutest details you can image: there are flower, butterflies and ladybugs on the tree, there is a milk carton next to the plate of fish for the kitten and there is a hidden treasure underneath the tree.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the new rounded Friend box which is already elegant in it's own right but it's not nearly as good as the finished set. The instructions are a bit simple, which probably fits the target age group. I don't really see how this could be improved.<br></p><p>5/5 = excellent<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There are not many large parts in the set and most parts are fairly generic for reuse in other builds with a few new soft colours (light blue and purple). Big bonus is that there are NO stickers!<br>There are several special parts for most of the flowers and all animals.<br><br>4/5 = good<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Depending how you look at it there is either one or there are 3-11 minifigures in this set. All the animals (and insects) are one-piece parts that look nice and cute but are not reusable in any format. I prefer the built-up animals that are becoming more common in creator sets.<br>Olivia herself is not exactly a minifigure but as such, but well, we'll give her that one.<br>3/5 = Decent<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building this set is pleasant. The set is big enough to give you a bit to do without leaving you with disappointment that it's already finished, and you can slowly see things coming together. Everything is built up from multiple small pieces so it really feels like you are building Lego. Nothing too exciting in the build though.<br></p><p>4/5 = Good<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>SO CUTE. Seeing the set up close is so much cuter than I expected; I almost wanted to hug it. This set is why I was excited about the new <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=31010-1"">31010 Tree House </a>that was announced for 2013 but that set does not nearly have to attraction that this one does.</p><p>5/5 = Excellent<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I recommend anyone with any interest in Lego to try this set. It's a perfect example of how Lego got it right in launching the Friends line.</p><p>For this reason this sets belongs at the top for me:<br>5/5<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-26T10:47:23.567Z","Fantastic looking Tree House","<p><strong>Set #3065 Olivia's Tree House: </strong>Some LEGO Friends sets I chose to skip initially if only to keep my spending on the line a bit down, and also I was still skeptical about the entire Theme. Whether it would be worth pursuing, the sheer fact of the many unique designs and set ideas that have come out of this line really made me re-consider once I got started on it. And nothing is more indicative of this aspect of the Friends Theme than Olivia's Tree House.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Right off the bat the set draws your eye with it's brilliant box design. It shows a fun looking and unique build, and while the 'House' isn't much of an actual structure with full walls and things like most tree houses tend to be, the simple fact that you can build up a fun looking set going off the box image is just pure fun.</p>
<p>The Instruction manual is typical of LEGO's design, fun looking. Functional with easy to follow instructions and help in which piece to use next and a back page/interior cover that shows off all the other various sets you can get from the first batch of 2012 sets makes them very impressive. There is no cardboard protection for them, much like every other LEGO set from other Themes in this price range, however the method the Friends line uses to package their sets must be different as I haven't received a single crushed, mangled, bent, folded or creased manual from the larger box sets.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set is chock full of useful and fun parts, there are many red flower tops, butterflies and lady bugs, a hoard of purple, pink, teal and lavender colours to choose from and the base of the tree itself is a bunch of interesting brown pieces that could come in handy for MOCs. The blue basket on top of the tree is a nice looking part too, and you get two Friends animals in the set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Like with pretty much every Friends set below a certain price tag you're only getting one Mini-Doll in the set. This is Olivia, she isn't much different from other iterations of the Mini-Doll. She's wearing the same cute top seen in the Olivia's House set and is also wearing the same skirt with leggings combination that her pal Emma wore in Emma's Fashion Design Studio.</p>
<p>Not much really to say, 2012 had a stunning re-use of Mini-Doll parts in the same colours and I'm glad LEGO started trying a bit harder in 2013 with more unique prints and colourings for the doll pieces. Still, this is a great representation of the character even if she doesn't have anything truly unique about her print or design.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I can honestly say this was a fun build, working on the tree base then strengthening it up and fleshing it out with more detail work as you go from Number 1 to Number 2 with the LEGO Numbered bag system was pure awe inspiring fun.</p>
<p>Even the smaller models in the set, the birdhouse and the cat bed were fun little builds.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This Tree House works, it is superbly designed. It doesn't exactly look like a fully enclosed 'house', that doesn't stop it from being a truly brilliant design. It stands out too as being the only LEGO tree house I've ever actually seen before, as far as I can recall... Unless the Creator line has done something similar for their Modular Houses line, I rarely follow it despite finding their models quite fun too.</p>
<p>Everything about this model works though as a functional play structure, there are no gimmicky add ons, nothing as silly as tossing in a Flick Fire missile or anything like that. The best part about this model is the use of imagination for play, you build a solid structure and then you populate it with Mini-Dolls to have an adventure.</p>
<p>The telescope and 'look out' post are pretty fun aspects of the model, I love the tiny birdhouse you get to build for Goldie and Maxie, the cat, get's a nice little bed. They also have a dish with a fish and a carton of milk to feed the cat down on the ground.</p>
<p>I love the new tree/flower accessory pieces, all the various types of flowers used to flesh out the tree's leaves and make it more colourful are simply amazing. I think the Lady Bugs could use a few black dots to make them more authentic and the butterfly pieces being all one colour isn't entirely true to real life. Still that's not something to be too concerned about for the Friends line, and eager young artists might want to try adding their own colours to the mix for these parts if they wanted to.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a really strong offering from last year's LEGO Friends line and I strongly urge anyone still on the fence with this line to give it a try, the price range for what you get isn't terrible and the sheer impressive level of detail for this design goes a long way to show what LEGO Friends is capable of.</p>
<p>Definitely pick this up if you haven't done so already before LEGO decides to add it to their ever growing Retiring Soon list, if it isn't there already, you can't go wrong with it. The only minor issue I have with it is the fact that you only get one Mini-Doll with it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
