"OhioBobcat555","2012-01-30T23:38:53.667Z","Surprisingly not that bad","I bought this set for my two year old daughter. She is already enamored with Lego Friends. <br><br>I am actually pretty happy with the set, although it will not be heading to my Lego metropolis any time soon. I am writing this as an AFOL who has collected many castle, town, space, and Star Wars sets in the past 30 years and am new to this...<br><br>I will keep this simple:<br>Pros:<br>1. Durable: It is built well. Too many Lego sets lately are less function and play and more display. My 2 year old is able to lug this thing around with ease. <br>2. It's a 2 seater! You can fit two Lego friends in the front seats. This is something that always irked me about regular Lego minifig cars... they rarely achieve this.<br>3. You could easily modify this for traditional minifigs... although only one guy could fit... and doubtful that minifig would want to be caught in a purple car. <br>4. Detailed very well. Rear view mirrors, a nice printed dash board display, license plate (sticker), front grill and headlights and tail and turning lights. <br>5. AFOLs as me who collect town/city sets may find the city light and gold faucet useful. <br>6. A cell phone/ MP3 player?! It is pink if you're into that. <br>7. Tons of tiny accessories that a young gal (or guy) may enjoy... brushes, sunglasses, bows, etc... some compatible with regular minifigs.<br>8. The girl minifig can fit sunglasses and earrings in her hair which my girl really enjoys.<br>9. A dog with new mold (I think) that can also get bows put on it. <br><br>Cons:<br>1. stickers<br>2. price is a little high but that is standard with Lego<br>3. A little sad to see this thing and wonder why the regular city sets could not have sported a two seater as this (different color scheme of course) with traditional minifigs. <br><br>Surprised! Not that bad at all!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"AETerry","2012-02-24T13:34:49.857Z","Stephanie's Cool Convertible Review","<p>I bought this set as a Valentine's gift for my daughter and it currently is the largest of the Friends sets that she's got. She really likes and wants to get more of the sets. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is card board with slight bent design on it that pushes in. The illustration shows clearly what the set is.</p><p>The instructions are fairly easy to follow with step-by-step illustrations. It was more complex though for my daughter who missed a page or steps and I'd have to back track her to make sure we didn't miss any steps.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 130 pieces to this set and almost doesn't feel it's worth the $14.99 to shell out for it. There are a wide variety of hair piece accessories that my daughter just loved and used immediately for her other Friends minidolls. Other notable pieces are the pink tile piece for the phone/ipod player, the dog piece, gold faucet and pink bucket.</p><p>There's also stickers on this set and my daughter required some help putting those on.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set comes with one minidoll, that of Stephanie who's blonde. She's fairly decent considering the intent and design of these figures and I must go by my daughter's reaction to that she loves them<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This set is the most complex of any of the Friends sets that my daughter has done and she really did need help on this, mainly for making sure there weren't any missed steps. But she did do most of it and from an adult perspective, it is easy. <br></p><p>The set gets built in a couple of stages. First for the street light with the faucet and bucket. The second for the car itself and it's this part my daughter had the most trouble with, but she did succeed despite some frustrations over my helping her.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once the set is completed, it is a beautiful piece and one my daughter loves to play with. She loves best the accessories for hair. She's even taken one of her other minidolls to sit with Stephanie in the car as they drive around.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Given the target audience of this set with young girls who love the color pink, this set has gone over very well with my daughter. She just loves it and had a huge amount of accomplishment for getting it built given her age of five. She's eager for more of the Friends sets and I am still needing to have her wait, save up and earn them as rewards.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"ponzu","2013-04-27T01:43:21.997Z","Decent set that beefs up the vehicles fleet and the pet population in Heartlake City","Note: My reviews summarize the opinions and experiences of a 6-year-old girl and her father, both of whom have been playing with LEGO Friends for less than a year.<div><br></div><div>To me, the convertible was (naturally) fun to build and play with. The rest of the set, not so much. I still don't know what the tall pole with a light-looking and a branch-looking thingies is supposed to represent.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The convertible and the puppy figure in most of my 6-year-old's play scenarios, but the puppy only occasionally gets washed, groomed or decorated using the parts of the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Stephanie was lost almost immediately thanks to our 3-year-old menace of a little sister, but Stephanie's hair was spared, and now Emma gladly wears it when she feels like being a blonde.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I feel my girls should have gotten a bigger kick and more use out of the miniature smartphone, but it only occasionally gets noticed and played with. Small parts are hard for small kids to track, and this set, like many other Friends sets, is full of them. I am giving the set 4 bricks for playability and overall because I feel we did not realize its potential and I want to be fair.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
