This one of several small sets in the Friends line that fall into a $10 range or less, making them easy to pick up and add to a collection, even if on impulse. My daughter was interested in this set due to the puppy that comes with it. Given she's the target audience for this theme, she's really taken to it.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is made of cardboard and features the Friends logo and depicts a clear illustration of what it is you're getting.</p><p>The instructions are in booklet form with easy to follow step-by-step illustrations of the set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 64 pieces with this set, which causes me at first to question if this set is worth the $9.99 paid for it. Since grandparents are who got it, I won't complain too much. And besides, I'm not the one playing with it, my daughter is. <br></p><p>You get several brown pieces for building a tree and most of the pink pastel pieces are for the accessories. Of which my daughter loves taking and using these to put on the heads of other Friends minidolls that she's got. New too in this set is the dog piece, blue barrel and lime green basket.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You have one Friends minidoll figure of Mia, who has freckles and brown hair. Given the styling of the Friends dolls, she's done very well and the appeal is very much so there for my daughter, holding her interest in playing it and others.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The set is built in various stages.</p><p>* Dog House - This is a straight forward build with pink ribbons on it and fushia roof tiles for it along with some flowers.</p><p>* Tree - This a bit more complex of a build and there's a lot of brown pieces here. I like best the use of the round red 1x1 plate pieces for apples or cherries on it.</p><p>* Table - This build is very simple, but completes out the model.</p><p>Most of the rest of any ""build"" is all of the accessories pieces so you can play with Mia grooming and getting her puppy ready for a dog show.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's a good little set and I certainly how it holds a strong appeal for young girls given my daughter's reaction to this set. Still not that many parts to it unless you're wanting pieces for a decent tree build. Those looking to collect the Friends line are sure to like and enjoy this set and so far I see how each of the sets has a strong appeal to young girls with each one offering something new and different to appeal to all of the different tastes and styles of play.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nothing special - typical for the $10 Friends sets. It does show a nice image of the build out. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for even the youngest/newest Lego builders.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Set contains 64 ""pieces""; however four of those 64 pieces make up the Mia minifig. Countering that, each set of four white and yellow flowers counts as one piece (since four flowers come on a single sprue). Then the pet grooming set (6 items), the award ribbons (2 items) and hair bows (8 items) all together (16 items) count as just one piece, too. Incidentally, the piece missing from Lego's database is the reddish brown arch 1x5x4 for the tree (part ID 2339, element ID 4544167).</p><p>The parts are mainly basic - nothing too special about most of the bricks with the exception of the large blue barrel. Overall it's a nice, albeit small, selection that has good&nbsp;reusability. There actually isn't too much of the signature ""Friends"" colors. No purple, no magenta, no azure, no light blue/aqua. The only pink bricks (so not counting the grooming set, ribbons and bows) are a few (4) roof tiles and two 1x3 bricks. Mostly the set uses white, tan, green (regular and lime), and brown. With the pink roof and the blue barrel, the color palette is pleasing and complimentary to the other Friends' structures.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One actual minifig - Mia, and a pet puppy - nothing exciting here, but the juniorized puppy is cute, and is perfect for the target audience. Lots of accessories are included in this set, though, which helps increase playability.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build out is extremely simplistic, however the dog house is creative and looks very nice. Nothing complex here. Takes only a couple of minutes for even a young, inexperienced builder to complete.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Three mini structures (and that's being generous calling a 4x4 plate and four 1x1 cones a ""structure"") comprise the completed model along with the large blue barrel sitting independently. Both the dog house and the tree are very well executed, especially given the few pieces that go into each component. No alternative builds were shown on the box or in the instructions, which is unfortunate. Even the Friends' Animals subtheme each has an alternative build for half the number of parts, plus a larger build that uses all the parts from all three animals in each series. (Going off on a tangent here: having a super set to create using the parts from three (very inexpensive) smaller sets is extremely exciting for a young girl and is smart marketing on Lego's part. Even if the child didn't like cats, for example, s/he would still want, rather NEED, to get the set just to be able to build out the super set.)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I mentioned earlier, this set is a nice complement to the other Friends sets, particularly the (also retired) Heartlake Dog Show (3942). I do wish they could have come up with some sort of alternative build with the parts though. The limited build is mainly why I gave the set a score of three overall. However, if you have young girls between 5 and 9 years old, this would make a good, but not essential, addition to a Lego Friends collection, if you were lucky enough to get it while it was still on the store shelves. Hard to say if it's worth even the retail price, much less what is being asked for on eBay for a set now (50% - 100% over retail). If you're going to spend $10, you'd be better off getting one of the Friends sets with a little more versatility (like Andrea's Bunny Hutch, but better hurry since that's about to retire too) or even TWO sets from the Friends Animals subtheme (@ $5 each). Don't bother trying to track this one down.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
