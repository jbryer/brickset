She is more into the traditional girl things. As soon as she saw the new Lego Friends sets she asked if we could get her some. The only parts she had trouble with was getting the plastic rims on the rubber tires. If Lego keeps making them, we'll keep buying them.</span></div></div></div><div class=""BVRRReviewDisplayStyle5Tags"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.2; ""></div><div class=""BVRRReviewDisplayStyle5Recommendations"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 12px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.2; ""></div></span>",FALSE,5,4,2,5,4
"AETerry","2012-03-16T13:25:04.757Z","Stephanie's Pet Patrol Review","<p>Another Friends set that I've gotten for my daughter and one she's been asking for the last couple months. She has really taken to these sets and has been enjoying them.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows a clear picture of the set and what it is you're getting with a lavender border and the Friends Logo on it. It's small, made of cardboard and for those so inclined, can be used to store the set in or to toss into a recycle bin.</p><p>The instructions are in LEGO's clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations. The set is just complicated enough that my daughter still needs me to point out when she misses a step. There's also a parts list at the end of the instructions in case replacements are ever needed and a small catalog showing what other sets are in the Friends line.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a total of 73 pieces along with a few extras. Most notable are the bunny minifigure which is my daughter's favorite. There's also a carrot piece, new style handle bars and lots of new pastel pieces. I'm tempted to buy a set for myself after seeing the huge tires on this, it gives me ideas for a vehicle build to try out.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Rather a minidoll as the Friends minifigures are called, this one is of Stephanie. The title character of this set who has long blonde hair. She's detailed decently and looks alright.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build comes in four stages, with each individually being fairly simple. It just takes about fifteen minutes and for someone like my daughter, it's still a bit challenging, but not enough to make her frustrated or give up.</p><p>1st) Green bushes - This went together fairly quickly and my daughter gets some green vine pieces to use for her own LEGO bricks.</p><p>2nd) Bunny House - This mini-build proved to be a bit challenging, especially with pressing down on bricks and tile pieces to get them to snap together. My daughter did ask for my help on this part of the build.</p><p>3rd) 4x4 ATV - I'm not sure how else to call this vehicle. This was another build that my daughter needed help with putting the pieces on. It has a new style handle bars so the minidolls can hold on and look like they're driving.</p><p>4th) Trailer/Wagon - It's a small hook up to the ATV, this went fairly quick and easy for my daughter to build and is what Stephanie uses to haul around a carrot and a small bundle of hay. Least I assume that's what the ridged, yellow 1x2 brick is for.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, for the target audience of whom these Friends sets are intended for, this one is a rather huge success with my daughter. She loves it and plays with it. At $9.99, it's priced fairly decently for a comparatively small set. After Mia's Puppy House and now this set, I've an idea of which sets that my daughter likes best as she has asked for them the most. While we may not get all of the Friends sets, I'm sure we'll end up with quiet a few of them, especially those featuring animals.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
