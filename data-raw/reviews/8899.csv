I collect a lot of City sets, and seing these cute girly lego Friends set makes me think this will be a good fit when i build a big city. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review, I actually have my daughter build this set and it just took her less than 15min as she hardly build legos. The brick elements&nbsp;are nothing new and nothing we've never seen before. The awesomeness of this set comes from the color of the bricks, pastel colors that very cute in the eyes and makes it attractive for girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first build is always the minifigure, the minifigure is a big change from the usual minifigures we've come to love, yet this is what makes this theme clicks to young girls besides the pastel color bricks. I was glad to see that the Friends minifigures hair fits with the old minifigures as they have new hair pieces, which are rubber by the way. Other than that that,s about it. I was a bit worried as the Friends minifigures arms&nbsp;will break as they were very skinny, but it does hold its own when played. Only thing with these minifigures is it does not&nbsp;snugs with the bricks pegs&nbsp;when they sit down, making them slide down more often than not. Second build is the pot with a flower,&nbsp;nothing special in that at all. Third build was the beach bench with a table. Color is cute but minifigure keeps slipping, thats the only bad on it I think. Final build was the jacuzzi, its a simple&nbsp;but cool design. Would have been better if the actual height is a bit higher, as it is just by the waist when minifigure is sitting (as seen in the picture). Even with all of these good's and bad's this set is worth buying for the price and for the playability. Im sure this will be a success and will widen the lego fan base... well it got my attention. :)</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

 The set in itself is fun, thought not really exciting. It contains a sunlounger with a parasol, a tiny pool, an ice cream coupe&nbsp;and a pot with a plant. The pool is barely deep enough fo the mini-doll to sit in and feels a bit flimsy to me. I think it would provide a good play experience for a kid as part of a bigger collection, but is hardly sufficient on its own.</p>

 From a collector&#39;s point of view, the bricks are standard so they should be easily reusable (among other parts, you get 4 macaroni in the all new &quot;medium azure&quot; color). Moreover, this the cheapest way to get a mini-doll figure (for more info about it, check&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.joeledition.org/jblog/lego-friends.html"">http://www.joeledition.org/jblog/lego-friends.html</a>).</div>

At 43 pieces the build isn't exactly rocket science but it's amazing what can be done with so few pieces. The set has the usual spares but I also like the new flower studs of which you also get a spare. Anyway. Pros and Cons<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Inexpensive at EUR5.99<br></li><li>Pretty much all the pieces are compatible with other minifigures (head/body not included)<br></li><li>The new colours are great - an amazing way to add colour to other models</li><li>Emma's hair on regular minifigs.</li><li>The flowers<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Why target just girls? I see some of the larger sets have a 'Peter' minifig so maybe 1 or 2 small sets with a male fig would be good (not specific to this set)<br></li></ul>
<p>This is a theme where I will probably pick up some of the small to medium size sets mainly for the bricks but also for the set themselves. I like the look of the piano and also the design room. This set is really basic but still it is great value for money.</p><p><br></p><p>One last note. Take the hair from emma and put on the Intergalactic girl from series 6 and you have my sister-in-law. It's uncanny.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"AETerry","2012-01-23T13:50:39.11Z","Emma's Splash Pool Review","<p>I've been showing my 5 year old daughter some of the Friends sets to get an idea of what she thinks and had indeed shown an interest in the minidolls and their sets. So after a week of snow and being snowed in, we broke our cabin fever by getting down to the store and out of the house at the first chance. We saw the new Friends sets were out and I let her get this small set.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is of course the pastel purple and has LEGO's bright color photo showing what set it is you're getting.</p><p>The instructions are in booklet form with easy to follow step-by-step illustrations. The hardest part for me as the parent and AFFOL was to let my daughter follow the instructions and put it together herself without me interfering except for when helping get pieces pressed and snapped down or the one time I pointed out she missed a step.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are of course 43 pieces in this set with some extras. Many of which are new color shades of already familiar bricks. And the extra pieces my daughter happily went and put in her box of LEGO bricks for her collection.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You have only one minifidoll - Emma. My daughter likes this one rather well. She noticed that it's different from the standard minifigure but it doesn't stop her from wanting to play with either ones. Though she questioned why the legs don't move like the standard minifigure.<br></p><p>There were two parts of the figure that were in different styles of polybags, indicating one of them at least was made in China.</p><p>The hair piece has small holes on it that my daughter saw and was asking about. As I explained to her, that's when you get sets like the Beauty Salon, you can put little bows and hair pieces on them. So now she wants to see this Beauty Salon set and possibly get it.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As a small set at $5.99, it is fairly easy and a decent enough challenge for my daughter that she's not overwhelmed. It took her about 10-15 minutes getting it all together. The set is also built in three stages.</p><p>1st - A potted plant - My daughter quickly put this together, I blinked and missed it. I could almost call this unneeded to the build, but I can see it adds some detail to a little play scene and for my daughter, it adds some playing house.</p><p>2nd - Sun Lounger - My daughter got most of this build done easily enough. It was challenging for her with pressing down the tile pieces. That part troubled her a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>3rd - Splash Pool - The feature of this set. Again my daughter had some slight trouble with the tile pieces and getting them pressed down. But she did build all of it and took up a conversation with me about what if we had a large Lego swimming pool.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'd say as my daughter is clearly the target audience of the Friends line, a little girl who loves pink and loves all things girly, this set is a success with her. She didn't quite play with it, just displayed it. I'm not sure if that was emulating me where I'll build a set and then display it. But she did later play with it more and integrate it with her other bricks and a house she built earlier.</p><p>For myself as the AFFOL, I can see entertaining the idea of a second set for the pieces or looking through a pick-a-brick feature for pieces in order to create something similiar on a larger scale.</p><p>This set is a good introduction to the Friends line, my daughter is clearly loving it and wanting more of the sets and I'll have to devise ways for her to earn some of them, save her allowance or wait for certain holidays.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-05T11:19:14.85Z","Huge Discrepency in Prices","<p>Set #3931 Emma's Splash Pool: Just look at that CND Price compared to the rest of the world, it is a crying shame that sets which used to cost 6.99$ at retail in Canada have gone up TWICE in the past year alone, most of the sets are 7.99$ only at certain retailers. The actual price for this set at stores like TRU and Wal-Mart is 8.99$ (Or 8.86$) which is high-way robbery for these sets in the price-per-piece ratio. I found this for 7.99$ at London Drugs, and in December all month long is 20% off that price, so I got it for close to what the Americans pay, just about. Really the prices for LEGO's smallest size class seems to have done really bad of late. I used to remember being able to grab one of these types of sets up for 5$ and change, perfect for kids with allowance in their pockets looking for LEGO to play with on the car ride home. Now...</p>
<p>Enough about the price though, on to the set. This is the perfect set to add on to any number of LEGO Houses in the backyard, you have a lounger with an umbrella and a small place to rest your drink/ice cream or anything else. There's a potted plant, and a small wading style pool for a Mini-Fig to sit in. In fact this pool model has actually been seen in LEGO Video Games for comedic effect, don't believe me just go check out some footage of LEGO Star Wars II or The Complete Saga. The colors are different, but that's the same/similar style of pool the Speedo Wearing Stormtroopers can be found in, in certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>All in all some great little models for MOCers to use with some wonderful pieces in fun new colors. Sadly the Emma Mini-Doll is a bit of a dissapointment, not that she's a bad Mini-Doll, she's just as great as the ones found in other sets. However that's the big problem, all of these pieces can be found in other sets, she's wearing Stephanies lower torso with her skirt and sneakers and her upper torso is the same shirt found on other Emma Mini-Dolls. For a set called Emma's Splash Pool there isn't much of a Swimming/Pool Theme Mini-Doll here. Perhaps they were trying to avoid controversy or something, all I know is if you're going to make a set theme based on swimming then the figures included should at least be dressed for the occassion, nobody goes swimming with their shoes on, let alone a skirt and tee-shirt. If they didn't want to make a one-piece swimsuit body/print job for the Mini-Doll figure they could have at least given her a bit of a compromise in the design so she could be lounging next to the pool in maybe a shirt covering up the swimsuit and a pair of sandals or something.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say if you can get this set on sale for a good price you're going to enjoy the models found in it for MOCing a proper looking back yard lounge area, with a small pool for the children, perhaps next to your larger pool for the adults. The children will appreciate it for the Mini-Doll and the great pieces, plus it is simple and easy to build. However the price is a real downer for something in a box the size of an impulse set. You also get a spare flower petal to add to your army of extra stems you'll be recieving in all the LEGO Friends sets. It is unfortunate that the set is only half-thought out&nbsp;by the designers. I guess a unique Mini-Doll print is asking too much for such a small set. I feel it offers a lot yet fails to deliver on a few key elements. I still reccomend it as a good set though.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
