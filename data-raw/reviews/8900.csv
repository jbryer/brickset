Missingno here, and this is my first critical review. <br>&nbsp;I received this set for Christmas as a surprise gift. I'm a heterosexual male, and when I saw this gift, my eyes lit up. I knew that Stephanie's hair was useable, and that the milk carton was a printed piece. When I received the set, I also discovered that there was a varied amount of lime pieces. But that was all I knew about the set.<br>&nbsp;My hands were shaking eagerly with excitement as I tore of the tape from the set. Yes, there was tape on this small set, and there were no punch holes. Quite weird. Before opening the set, I noticed who straight forward the back was, which just showed how Stephanie can bake and spice, and a CGI version of Stephanie. I can't say I was expecting more from the back of the set.<br>&nbsp;There were two bags- a regular sized plastic bag with the big pieces and Stephanie (Stephanie was inside a new small plastic bag), and then there was a smaller plastic bag. The instructions were quite small, and were loosely in the box. <br>&nbsp;Upon opening the bags, I peered at the pieces. We got the superb Stephanie ""<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=frnd002"">mini-doll</a>"",&nbsp; and the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3005pb016"">milk 1x1 printed (teal?) block</a>. But that wasn't all of the cool pieces. The set also had a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=92947"">white round 2x2 brick with grille</a>, which was used in the 2011 Atlantis sets; an array of lime green pieces, a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3960pb20"">nice printed umbrella top</a><font class=""fv"">; and a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6256"">minifigure plate</a>, which was originally in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Belville"">Belville</a>. <br>&nbsp;The set took around 5 minutes to build, which consisted of a sink, a simple oven, and a table with some chairs. The chairs were a bit of a disappointment, since they were a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3941"">round 2x2 brick</a> with a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=4150"">round 2x2 tile</a>, but the simple sink made up for it. I think a little girl would enjoy the build.<br>&nbsp;Overall, this set is decent. Older builders of any gender can use it for a diorama, or for the pieces. Younger girls can play with it since it's a fun way to bake with their friend Stephanie. The build is quaint, and the same goes for the box. For what it's worth, the set is a good $5 buy.<br><br>You can watch my video review of the set here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHAWo2TJYgU<br></font>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"AETerry","2012-02-25T16:54:48.087Z","Stephanie's Outdoor Bakery Review","<p>I picked up this small set for my daughter recently as a small reward and treat. As far as the smallest of the Friends sets that are out, she's got both of them now. Now maybe she's not that much into Friends as I thought as she had set this to the side and didn't open it for a few days to put together or play with. So it might mean slow down a bit further with these despite her saying she wants them. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's a simple cardboard box with a clear illustration of the intended set and what's being gotten.</p><p>The instructions are of course in booklet form with easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 45 pieces in this set, many of which are pastel colors. Notable are a pink dish piece, printed milk carton piece, umbrella and a lot of pink 1x1 round plates.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's one minidoll with this set, that of Stephanie. It's fairly well detailed, comes with a blonde hair piece that can be used for other figures. This is now my daughter's second Stephanie doll, but that doesn't seem to stop her from playing with all of the Friends minidolls.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model<br></h4>After the convertible set, this set was far easier for my daughter to put together and get it done quickly. There's lot of different stages for this set and she enjoyed the experience very well as it meant I didn't have to help her with remembering missed steps or pieces.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>At $5.99 for this set, it still feels a bit pricy, but it is still an easy, cheap and inexpensive set to pick up, especially when you've got a little one who's into pink and is part of LEGO's intended target audience for the Friends theme. Even without the Friends theme, my daughter would still be into LEGO as this is a hobby that we're both into or that she's getting into because of Mom. For those looking for ideas on a quick build or pieces for a kitchen, the set is perfect.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-11T15:22:49.663Z","Baking Outdoors","<p>Set #3930 Stephanie's Outdoor Bakery: The small boxed sets from LEGO Friends line have been consistent in that they offer up a limited number of pieces for a relatively small amount. Most of them have at least something decent to enjoy about them, unique pieces, unique Mini-Doll or unique models, this set falls mainly in the medium shelf of those three choices... By which I mean that the models are pretty simplistic, yet the colors and pieces offer up some nice material for potential expansion or MOCing of other Friends sets.</p>
<p>There are three models built with this set, a small outdoor patio table and stool to sit on, an outdoor sink (not a common sight around this place that's for sure) and an outdoor oven. Yep, all the things you'll need to bake outdoors on the deck or patio of your summer cottage, summer home, farm? It's a pretty odd choice of Theme for the models I'll grant you, I suppose LEGO is trying to say Men barbecue outdoors, women bake... Hmm that didn't come out exactly right when I thought it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the models are quick, fast and easy to build, the outdoor patio table uses pretty standard pieces, there's a different color for them, Power Miners light green for the round bricks, but other than that there isn't much unique about the actual table... Well almost not, the umbrella piece has a nice printed purple and white pattern on top. What is better than the actual model are the accessories you place on top of the table, a small pastry of some kind with iceing, perhaps a cupcake or something, a transparent chalice with pink on top for an ice cream float and a carton of milk with a printed 1x1 brick and a white cheese slope for the top. These three items make up a bit for the lackluster approach to the patio table, it isn't as though there's anything wrong with how LEGO designed it, far from it, it is an accurate looking table. I think my main issue with it is the fact that it's just a bit smaller than the table would need to be for Stephanie to actualy mix all of the ingredients in a big bowl before putting them in the oven. A slightly wider table, with perhaps an extra stool to sit on, a mixing bowl and spoon would have made the model much better for play value and appearance.</p>
<p>The outdoor sink isn't as bad, true it's built up with barely a handful of pieces, however it serves its purpose. A place where Stephanie can get water for baking needs, you even have two cylinders with pink stud toppers, one I assume to be soap for washing your hands, the other perhaps an ingredient of some sort.</p>
<p>The oven is, quite honestly, ok. There are more green pieces here, a nice color choice really. And the oven itself works, it looks like a small oven, and it even fits something inside that Stephanie is preparing,&nbsp; a chocolate frosted treat made up of two differently colored 1x2 tiles and two pink studs. There's an element on top of the stove using black studs for making other types of treats, and of course sitting to cool is the cake. (I have no idea how Stephanie made such a large cake with such a tiny oven though, as it is a bit big for the actual oven.) The cake sits loosely inside of a pink tray, a new piece if I'm not mistaken introduced in this line. (It's nice to see the cake using one of the old Atlantis cylinder pieces, so that type of piece isn't just for making fancy columns.)</p>
<p>The Mini-Doll is Stephanie, she's got the same white top she's wearing in most sets with a light purple skirt and pink shoes this time. The only thing I find myself not liking about the Stephanie Mini-Doll compared to the others is the Hairpiece, I'm not sure if it's the color used for the material or what, but both of my Stephanie Mini-Dolls' hairpieces feel cheaper than the ones worn by the other Friends Mini-Dolls. I know that it is a softer plastic, more almost rubber used for the hairpieces on Friends Mini-Dolls, but there is just something about the feel and consistency of Stephanie's that is just terrible. I'm not sure if I can explain it good enough.</p>
<p>Overall I'm going to have to say this is, unfortuantely, the weakest of the three sets from this price range, mostly due to functionality. The models are simple, almost My Frist Bricks and More Theme simple compared to some of the other models in the smaller Friends sets, mostly because of the number of bricks chosen for it. While the overall theme of the set is nice, the colors are interesting and there are some good pieces being offered, the finished product here isn't as impressive as Emma's Splash Pool or even Water Scooter Fun. The cake doesn't sit snuggly into the pink dish, it isn't wide enough for the cake to fit smoothly in-between the edges of the dish. The oven part of the models is ok and the sink is nice, but I think the design of the table could have used a bit more work. Nothing a little MOCing couldn't fix, still at the price it is I can't fault it too much. And this is the cheapest way to get that nice printed milk carton brick, I'd reccomend this as a good starter set for someone just at that age range to handle these types of LEGO sets, older girls and fans will probably prefer something bigger and with more to offer than just special prints or parts.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
"nevertrustahippy","2012-03-15T04:25:40.553Z","Pretty in purple (and green and pink).","My initial reaction to the Friends theme was it being an abomination. &nbsp;It took Lego too far from its roots as a free form building toy and too close to leave-your-imagination-at-the-door Barbie style toys. &nbsp;Further insight into the strange and&nbsp;peculiar&nbsp;tastes of little girls has changed my mind. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>As the smallest Friends set I thought I'd test this one out on a little builder. &nbsp;Success was immediate. &nbsp;The little builder&nbsp;identified&nbsp;the Stephanie minifig as a little avatar straight away and once the build was complete set about washing her hands in the sink and baking cakes. I'll likely buy another set or two based on the positive reaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As the set itself goes I was reasonably impressed. &nbsp; The Friends minifig is generally&nbsp;compatible with other Lego. The footprint for a sitting minifig is 2 x 3 studs rather than 2 x 2 however. &nbsp;Also there's no way to secure a sitting minifig to studs. &nbsp;The detail on the minifig is excellent and while rather skinny, it's not Barbiesque. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build is extremely simple to the point of being a bit dull. &nbsp;Once built, though, the parts make a very good outdoor kitchen. &nbsp;The seat, table, sink, oven and the cake are all right sized for the minifig and well matched colour-wise. The playability of the set is very high for a set of only 45 mostly small pieces. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>From a MOC perspective, there isn't much scope for making anything else with the set but will be &nbsp;great addition to any bigger house a little builder may make with their other sets. &nbsp;The pieces in the set are quite varied and will be a useful, if not fantastic, addition to any collection. &nbsp;In particular there's not too much pink to put off any other little builders that do not like 'girl' Lego. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall as a doll set alternative this Friends set fits the bill while still being a good addition to any Lego collection. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
