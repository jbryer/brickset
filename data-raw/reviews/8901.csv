theme has 87 bricks/pieces and sells for around $10 in the 
USA.&nbsp;  The new dark purple, medium lavender, and magenta colors, along with and pink cheese slopes, are noteworthy.&nbsp;  With the overall genre of this set 
being about singing and performing, it lends to blending imagination 
with music.&nbsp;  Each owner can mentally tailor their own music preference 
to what they want to build and present.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The curtain design of 
red bricks teaches a subtle reverse-engineering trick.  I think it will 
get kids' mental gears moving on how to use the same technique in 
varying ways. &nbsp; The smaller purple stage has under-lighting, as well as spotlights.&nbsp; The piano is a complete, stand-alone design.&nbsp; I could see
 it sitting on a kid's desk or life-size piano :-)<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Since all
 Friends sets are System compatible, adding MiniFigures, or using solely
 MiniFigures is an easy option.&nbsp; Having other Friends over for a concert
 is also a nice option.&nbsp;  Andrea can set up her stage anywhere in 
Heartlake City, or any City you build.</p><h4>The completed model:</h4><p><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7003/6715757829_07726f6abd.jpg[/img]<br></span></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The build is easy enough for fun, yet challenging enough for spatial-engaging building.</span></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight:bold;""><br></span></p>

 Andrea is just one of the diverse characters of the Friends theme; she 
is complete by herself, yet stronger when enjoying a new scene with 
Friends.  The target age for this set can build it via instructions, 
and/or re-create for a personalized setting.  <span style=""font-style:italic;"">It certainly strikes a chord with the builder to sing or listen to music while building.</span>  Music is math too.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">My Own Creation (MOC) of Andrea's piano:</span></p>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7172/6720722047_cf27862844.jpg[/img]<br><br><span></span><p><span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Note:</span> Reviewer is an adult, who used to be a girl.</span></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"perfectlydark","2012-06-29T02:12:33.243Z","Great Lego House furnisher","<p>Whilst doing my kids (and ahem, mine) christmas shopping the other night, I saw this and similar sized Friends sets at $10AU, which is fairly reasonable. Being now 1AM, me tired and quite easily persuaded when lego is involved, I picked one of these ones up, mainly looking at the piano as a nice piece of furniture</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Pink small box (actually a good size, not oversized like many Lego boxes are), instructions are simple and easy to follow</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>contains 87 peices, with some lovely pink/purple/sand pink ( a good change from my usual collections). No stickers which is fantastic (Lego take not, if you can print 'Andrea' on a tile, you can do it for the more adult oriented sets too PLEASE). Includes 2 microphones which is excellent (one for the piano, one for the microphone, despite the fact all the pictures only ever seem to show one)</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Andrea. My first Friends minifig, pretty cool looking little thing I must say but like many others I prefer the standard figs. Still, she can be like a model or something in my city :)</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>nice and easy. I was amazed at both the simplicity and beauty of the piano. That was my favorite part in the set by far. I only just realised those red slopes on the stage represent curtains! The radio is pretty cool but like the previous reviewer said, it does suffer for not having studs on the bottom. Its pretty much best used as carried by Andrea.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very nice looking! The piano is very easily customisable (as the previous reviewer has done beautifully I might add!) The microphone stand is fairly boring IMO, and the stage itself kind of feels a little out of place. It might actually be very cool as a fancy doorway into a bedroom or something in a house, which I might do with it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I was quite surprised am am very happy with my purchase. As said above, it makes a great house furnishing kit (now theres a music room!) with some interesting colours and some pretty nice parts. I would grab it if your a lego house builder for sure, and whilst I cant speak from a young girls perspective, the amount of people I saw pick this and other Lego Friends sets (actually way more than other lego sets) makes me think TLG are on a winner here.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-26T11:19:35.08Z","Performing Tonight, Andrea...","<p>Set #3932 Andrea's Stage: The Friends line has done something great for young girls who have perhaps not played with LEGO before, they've introduced a new style of play pattern featuring a brand new Mini-Doll design with a more realistic look. If there is one thing I can safely say about the sets however, for the amount of pieces in each box and the prices most retailers ask for them, these smaller sets should maybe have two Mini-Dolls each, or perhaps extra torsos and legs for the Mini-Doll included so you can have two different outfits.</p>
<p>Despite this minor quibble I have to say I've throughly enjoyed the Friends sets I've been buying, they offer up a lot of interesting models, fun looking pieces and great fun little builds that can go anywhere your imagination takes them. Case in point, Andrea's Stage, with 87 pieces you build three small models that create an interesting set piece for a small club, or concert hall.</p>
<p>Andrea's Stage is a cleverly built set-piece, with light purple colored bricks for the front and red in back to simulate the open curtains on the stage the model looks like it'll get a lot of use for young singers and MOCers looking for a small stage to add to a building. Two black skeleton legs act as stage lights, and the printed tile with Andrea's name is an interesting, if limited, piece to see. In 2013 a similar model will be included with Mia's Magic Tricks, if you combine the two I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of the pieces. (Especially those nice looking dark rose colored bricks.)</p>
<p>Built out of around ten pieces or so, the second small model included with the set is a wedge shaped microphone stand/stage combination with three stage lights for the Mini-Doll or Mini-Fig performing. It isn't very large, however it does offer a nice set piece for Andrea to stand on, and the inclusion of the Microphone piece from the CMF accessories is quite welcome. Most of the parts aren't too unique though, so this is my personal selection for weakest model out of the set.</p>
<p>The third model however is sheer brilliance, it's a cleverly built grand piano with bench, mostly built with black pieces, including four black telescope pieces and another black skeleton foot, there are only a few light purple and one dark rose colored piece. There's also a clear chalice/cup on the side where Andrea, or someone playing the piano, keeps their water. I just love the look of this piano, the black skeleton leg is more than likely for holding a microphone, for certain performances. And the set includes an extra microphone that you can slide easily into the leg for anyone to use, so you get two microphones in total with this set, great job LEGO.</p>
<p>One final element is built with a few left over pieces, including a new printed red piece with a raido or stereo front. It has two handles and is all red, it's more of an extra brick-built accessory than a model, and fits ok with the musical theme of the Set.</p>
<p>Andrea is an African-American Mini-Doll, offering up some nice bit of diversity in the LEGO Friends line, she enjoys singing and her green top reflects this with the musical note pattern on it. She's wearing the same pants that came with Mia on her Skateboard, only this time they are white and her sandals are pink. She also has a flower pattern on the right side instead of the butterfly pattern on the left like Mia and Olivia have. Her hair is a dark brown and has a great curly pattern in the sculpt.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is a really good set for some great pieces, awesome looking models, though the microphone stand is a bit weak compared to that great looking piano and includes Andrea, who enjoys singing and music. I think a lot of young girls, even young boys will enjoy this set and the use for the stage and piano in MOCs are just brilliant, make up a little night club or showroom for your LEGO City or something equally ambitious. Reccomended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

They should have made the ink on the shirt better quality, so it would not rub off. I just had it for 3 months. Andrea&#39;s shirt is rubbed off, and I colored it with a permanent marker.&nbsp;</p>
