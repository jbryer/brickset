Little disappointed that the Hulk is the same size as the other ultrabuilds are as I would have though they would have made him bigger as they did with the standard minifigures in the Marvel sets.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, all of these ultrabuilds are alot of fun for kids as they stay together very well and make for good play value. The pieces are also going to be a plus since that Hulk green is fairly difficult to come by.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Our Video Review:&nbsp;</b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfzwxKdpv8"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfzwxKdpv8</a></p>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The Box&nbsp;is very Eye-Catching. And the Book was fine,&nbsp;I found no mistakes.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are fantastic! From Hulk's Lime Green Cheast Plate to his Bone Elements, it makes a perfect Parts Pack! The Hulk comes with 4 new pieces, including his Head, Chest Plate, And 2 Friction Joints at his hips. The Parts are very good for MOCing purposes also.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The Hulk's build might be the best Buildable Figure build there is! It is very Origanal and very Fun and Enjoyable! Like when you attach the back module to his main body frame, and when you make his shoulders, it's all fun!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The Completed Hulk is awesome! He is so...so...Hulking! The Chest Plate really make him stand out, and the Blue Pants look perfect! TLG says that Hulk now has ""Powered Up Armor"", so that explains the Dark Pearl Grey Armor Shells. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I reccomend this to Marvel Fans, Hulk Fans, And Hero Factory Fans!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
