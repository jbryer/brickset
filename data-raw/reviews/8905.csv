<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Like the other Superhero Ultrabuilds, it comes in a cardboard box. On the back it show all the features and what him and Green Latern look like combined.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Like other Ultrabuilds, these parts are extremely helpful for building heros for Hero Factory. I love the hair on Joker's head, as it's rubber! LEGO did a good job with the parts.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was&nbsp;easy and took me probably around 10 minutes. Even the smallest of kids won't have a problem, but they might need help with some parts.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The model looks great, as if it was straight out of a classic comic! The details are great, and FYI, the tails are for his coat!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, if you're&nbsp;a Batman fan, this is a must buy!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
