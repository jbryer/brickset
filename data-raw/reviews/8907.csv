<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows Green Lantern in space and behind him is a strange alien world.</p><p>The Instructions where fine, no bugs.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are awesome! There is a new lighter&nbsp;green color for the armor, and it has&nbsp;6 new pieces. These include the Morning Star pieces (his energy blast), his&nbsp;chestplate,&nbsp;his head, and friction joint attachments.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun, using all the new pieces and colors.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The finished Green Lantern not only look awesome, but is very posable! The shoulder pads move so you can pose the arms in any way.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I think this model is great for DC fans, Green Lantern fan, and people who like green!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
