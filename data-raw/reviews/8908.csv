I recently got back into LEGO after being away since my childhood, roughly twenty years ago.</i></div><div><br></div>Propeller Adventures is a 3-in-1 Creator set which includes instructions for a twin-engine airplane, a jet, and a hovercraft. The design of the airplane is similar to the de Havilland Mosquito, a British fighter/bomber used in WWII. The jet doesn't seem to be modeled after anything in particular, though it somewhat resembles the F-16. The hovercraft is of the large type designed to carry passengers.<div><br></div><div><b>Parts</b></div><div><br></div><div>I was drawn to this set mostly because of the variety of parts in colors I like to use. There are a lot of inverted slope bricks, single and double cheese wedges, about twenty Technic bushings, several wedge plates, and many other useful pieces.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Build</b></div><div><br></div><div>The main model is the most interesting build. Being a Creator set, things are straightforward and simple, but there are some good techniques used. The rounded nose is accomplished with studs-not-on-top design and looks quite good. The wings have a nice shape and are well attached to the fuselage. The highlight of the build is the integrated engine and landing gear assembly, which is a great example of fitting a lot of detail and functionality into a small space. This of course must be built twice, but at least it's a mirror-image so not exactly the same both times.</div><div><br></div><div>The jet is the least interesting build in the set, which serves it right for not being propeller-driven. There are some nice areas, like the intake at the front, but nothing about the process is notable. Even so, the model is well-designed, and uses the available parts well to create a good shape. It should be noted that this model uses just over half the parts in the set; when finished there are about 100 pieces left over (of course about twenty of them are bushings).</div><div><br></div><div>The hovercraft is a somewhat fun build, if only because it's interesting to see how the pieces are used. The inverted 2x2 slopes, for example, are used in a way they normally wouldn't be and are reinforced by strategic plate placement. Cheese wedges are used with their slopes to the inside to suggest outer windows. In somewhat ironic fashion, the propeller pieces serve as the bases for the fan housings. The model as a whole has a nicely sloped front but the rest is fairly blocky.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Playability</b></div><div><br></div><div>Not much can be done with the hovercraft but rotate the fans. At least the bottom is flat, so it could be ""driven"" around on a relatively smooth surface. It obviously does not float!</div><div><br></div><div>The jet is definitely ""swooshable"" and looks quite sleek and menacing flying around in the hand. As a model for display, however, it sits a bit low due to the lack of landing gear.</div><div><br></div><div>The twin-engine airplane has the best playability, which should come as no surprise. Though a bit front heavy, it sits nicely in the hand for maneuvering about. The propellers spin, of course, but the best play feature is the landing gear. The front landing gear are retractable and can be locked into place when open. The key point, though, is the tail wheel, which is on a rotating plate. This allows the plane to be easily steered in any direction and also allows the plane to pivot in place as might be done by a real airplane with propellers on each wing. The model is also quite durable. It survived several minutes of being driven on the floor by my 22-month-old.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall</b></div><div><br></div><div>I think this set is a pretty good value for the cost. While I was able to find it on clearance at about 45% off retail, I do believe it's worth more than that. I had been eyeing it for some time and was ready to pay full price.</div><div><br></div><div>Though I love the main model and its build, I was a bit disappointed in the build of the secondary models relative to the build of the main model. I suppose that's to be expected, though, given the nature of the set.</div><div><br></div><div>One final note: The red port and green starboard lights on each model are a nice touch, as they follow international standards for signal lights on such vessels. While not really a playability feature, they could definitely be used in an educational way, for example to get a child interested in learning more about aircraft, etc.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

We were supposed to break the social norm so I bought this LEGO Set, sat on the side walk and built the first model, and then ran around the strip mall making airplane noises. It was awesome, and I couldn&#39;t be happier with my choice.<!--?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /--><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The Models that can be made with instructions are a very nice size for them to all be held in one hand. They are also very sturdy as not a single piece detached as I was running frantically with the airplane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;""><strong>Airplane:<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The best model. It uses all the pieces with the exception of two axel pins and the extra pieces. This is the model I ran around with and it was my favorite. Great design, nice use of SNOT works to create a smooth hull, and the functions on the wheels are wonderful. Fantastic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;""><strong>Jet:<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The worst model. It uses only half of the pieces available, and it doesn&#39;t even use propellers so why is it in this set? I don&#39;t know. The model is still top quality, but it is just not that comfortable to hold in one hand. It wasn&#39;t all too enjoyable to build either. It was just plate on top of another plate on top of another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;""><strong>Hovercraft:<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The third best model. It was very enjoyable to build because it uses some very unique designs like SNOT and having the 1x1x2/3 slopes facing inward to create a design. Very moderate of a model.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">But how can this be? One is best, one is worst, and one is third place yet there are only three models! There is an alternate model and it can be only be found online. Contrary to what the instructions with the set say, you must got to Lego.com and select Create &amp; Share and enter the LEGO Club. Once you are there, you enter the Clubcodes section, and you enter the Codename: WINGS. This can be found in a LEGO Club Magazine from early summer 2012. So then what does this alternate model create?</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;""><strong>Tilt-Rotor Aircraft:<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">This is a very good model, it is the second best model, and should have taken the jet&#39;s spot in the instructions from the box. It incorporates the wheels, larger propellers, another easy to handle size, and it is the reason the two axel pins come with the set. They were never used in the previous three models.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">Overall, all three models are good and if for no other reason, the parts are nice. Because I am usually a Star Wars kind of guy, I found a few pieces I have never seen in a set like the 1x4 with two studs, and the new 3x4 wedge/slopes, and then parts in colors I am not used to seeing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The set is also cheep so you get good playability (Mainly swooshing, but what&#39;s better than that? I mean honestly, what function could&nbsp;beat swooshing?) great pieces, and an nice array of models to choose from. Definitely worth the humiliation. But if you just want to buy it and build it at home, that&#39;s okay, too.</span></p>
