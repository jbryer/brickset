Well, it didn't go wrong and this is a good looking, fun little set. I beleive it looks like a Triumph Street Triple with the twin headlights and the big, single side exhaust.&nbsp; I'll be reviewing this set as the main model since the two alternate models looked a bit funky to me.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good amount of detail (the engine looks like an engine, the seat looks like a seat, ect).</li><li>Very nifty suspension allows the rear swingarm to move.</li><li>Comes with a kick stand, which is a nice touch.</li><li>Cute little front fender.</li><li>Lots of orange!</li><li>It's a motorcycle!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The two alternate models just don't look all that great.</li><li>No front turn signals.</li><li>A little bit over priced, in my opinion.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>All in all, this is a good set for all ages.&nbsp; It makes a nice shelf or desk display for older Lego fans, and has tons of playability for the younger ones.&nbsp; And since it's Lego, you can modify it any way that you want, so I replaced the orange ""cheese"" bricks on the front of the tank with transparent orange ones to give it some front turn signals.&nbsp; It's not an expensive set, but I would have lowered the price buy a few dollars, it's pushing $20 and it's not very big.&nbsp; Well, there it is; my first review.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

The set is not very cheap, as for me, but it's only one bike in ""Creator"" series for many years, so must have.</p><p>Pros</p>
<ul><li>Perfect main model design. Like a real bike!</li><li>Funny orange color.</li><li>Working elements like suspension and kick-stand.</li><li>Realistic lights in main model.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Alternate models are not so perfect.</li><li>A bit overpriced.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>
The main model design is very cool. The alternate model of chopper is funky, I really can not even imagine the orange chopper. Third model is fun, but nothing special.
