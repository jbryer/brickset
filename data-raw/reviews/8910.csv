"ryan_570","2013-02-18T17:37:32.763Z","Everything I love about lego is in this set.","I loved Lego when I was a kid, and also dinosaurs. I recently turned 26 and my girlfriend who was aware of my childhood, bought me this set as a bit of nostalgia. I probably hadn't touched a peice of Lego in about 14 years. When I opened this set and started to build, everything that I loved about Lego hit me once again.<br><br><b>The Build</b><br>The build is brilliant, quite varied except the legs. I enjoy a lengthy build time and it wouldn't take much more than 30mins but that's still decent. <br><br><b>Pieces &amp; Value</b><br>The model looks just great, the picture here doesn't do it justice. The 
parts that come with the set are plentiful for the money and really 
varied. I've already made loads of different stuff with them like a 
spaceship and a robot. <br><br><b>Playability &amp; Display-ability<br></b>As a 26 year old I'm not so into playing with it, but I can imagine loving this as kid and creating some Jurassic park chases with a Lego Jeep! <br>I do however display this in the living room, it often gets compliments from visitors. I did think at first it wouldn't stand up well but I soon got the hang of how the legs work with torso and it actually balances really well and has loads of options for positioning.<br><br><b>Summery</b><br>I'm very glad to have something different like this in my collection. I would confidently recommend this set to anyone. I'm extremely happy I have it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>Color scheme. Dark red and regular red work well together here.</p>

<p>Overall shaping is decent. Very reminiscent of what it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>3-in-1 option to build two other dinosaurs. One looks like a pteranodon and the other a small brachiosaurus (maybe?).</p>

<p>Ratchet hinge allows more sturdy poses, but also limits movement.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>Tail isn&#39;t horizontally moveable like you would expect.</p>

<p>Other two options are weaker, but gives more variety and playability. T-Rex is the draw for most, but that is up to debate on preference.</p>

<p>Not as free moving as expected mostly due to piece availability.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>Overall a decent set. It is limited by part usage only because of the year it was released. The new green Creator dinosaur for 2017 looks far superior because of newer techniques and pieces available. (And I would assume more realistic coloring). Since this set is older, I&#39;d wait to get the newer version unless you absolutely had to have a T-Rex of some kind.</p>
