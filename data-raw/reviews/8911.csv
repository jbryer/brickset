"forneiro","2012-02-01T22:05:36.62Z","Nice set","<p>A nice little set with a good selection of bricks and colors. I bought it mainly because of the bricks and not for the set (3 different versions) itself but the models are actually quite good.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice colors<br></li><li>A lot of different bricks</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>None of the models is at Minifig scale<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Overall I would say it's a fun set, and good value for money.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"legolover2001","2012-06-30T10:53:48.297Z","Best car set ever!","<span></span>This is one amazing set guys! I mean just look at it! it has dozens of futures and cool parts as well as looking cool!<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The parts are great.<br></li><li>Can fit minifigs.</li><li>At 152 pieces it is great for the price if you want it for the parts.</li><li>Window and the bonnet are great.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Doors are hard to open on the main car.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>As you can see, there are almost no cons! Also as I said before the car is not made for minifigs but they can fit some but unfortunately in the vintage car racer you have to take of the minifigs arms and legs to fit him in! &nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Come with two instruction booklets, one for the main model, with the second book serving the other two model.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>A good collection of plates in blue and medium-blue. Some nice long curved parts for the bonnet / hood, and in fact this is the only set you'll find the curved 4 x 1 slope in medium blue. And for fans of the less usual, two transparent clear bionicle tooth parts used to add curve to the bonnet. Remember,Creator sets are not about weird and wonderful parts, but about doing your best with regular elements.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None come with the set, but the car is minifig scale, i.e. add your own.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>As per all Creator series models, building a decent model out of a basic elements is what this set it about, and it does not disappoint. Adults and kids can learn from the construction. No fancy techniques, but good on the basics. All three models are quick, but a pleasure to put together.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The main model looks good and plays well. Sturdy construction. Can take 5 minifigs with ease, albeit with 3 standing at the back. Survived a drop from table height to the floor. Kept my kids entertained for a few hours without falling apart. Any parent who's had to reassamble fancy-looking Ninjago vehicles for the umpteenth time will know what a relief this is.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>At the time of writing (August 2012) this set is available heavily discounted from many sources, and if you want a good value collection of blue/mid blue pieces with some nice curves, this is it. So yes, it is another car, but it is worth having.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"peterdimi","2012-08-06T10:54:53.973Z","Not too bad...basic car set","Got this one for my 6-yr old daughter, and we built the 3 models together. We both enjoyed it.<br><br>There are instructions for another model through the LEGO club, which I haven't yet build, but it looks good, and will try today. <br><br>In a mean time I build a nice little tractor with the set (will write down instructions and post). A F-1 race car would be possible as well and will try that soon.<br><br>Overall nice set, that offers options to your imagination; playability is very basic - no steering, no minifig fit; the cars are compact and stable; nice color scheme. I find it rather pricy here in Canada - incl. the taxes it becomes close to $17-$19, Walmart to Toys r us.<br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,2
