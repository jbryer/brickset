"tkettle9719","2012-02-04T18:25:46.417Z","Air Show Remembrance!","<p>I just got this set at my Target using a Gift Card, and am quite pleased
 by this little set. It's a reasonably priced set, very smooth, and 
reminds me of air shows I used to go to, since I lived in a military 
city. I've only built the plane, and that is probably the only way I 
will build it. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The landing gear is excellently used, and is honestly a very simple solution that could have been quite overdone.<br></li><li>-The plane is quite sleek, and slender. Very nice and small, but bigger than I had expected it to be.&nbsp; </li><li>-The many angle pieces are excellent, seeing as I (and many) can never have too many of these in their collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-While it is sturdy for smaller children, the build did have some small 
glitches  with instability, but they are all quite minor. </li><li>-The color scheme has disappointed me for the first time ever in a Lego 
set; it's almost ugly, in a sense, but it does have its accuracy points.
 </li><li>-The landing gear, although I said it was very nice, is unsymmetrical, because the wheel in the front is towards the left of the plane when looking at the plane from the front. <br></li></ul>
<p>I love Creator for its simplistic beauty, and the nice sets they produce
 with such common bricks. This set is in no way an exception to the 
Creator philosophy. I highly recommend this for children, but it almost 
feels like a display set due to the limited playability. Still very nice
 for anyone to have. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
"n_zone","2012-02-09T03:38:18Z","Top Gun","<p>This Creator set is very good, especially if you like jets and helicopter. It is a reasonably priced set (AUD $16) and it has cool features such as landing gear. Super Soarer delivers that sense of speed by making the model look fast and sleek</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Functional landing gear</li><li>Pro 2: Jet is sturdy&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 3: Helicopter looks very cool</li><li>Pro 4: the jet and attack helicopter looks cool and sleek.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The boat</li><li>Con 2: The jet can look&nbsp;awkward&nbsp;in certain angles</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>If you feel the need for the speed, then get this set! I could give it 8.5 out of ten but I have to round it off to 10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"bridgitkbruce","2012-10-14T14:04:50.15Z","Great relatively easy but challenging build for the beginner.","My just turned 5 year old son got this set for his birthday. He was able to follow and build the jet with very little assistance. The jet is sturdy, and has endured hours of play carrying minifigs on its wings and has not yet needed to be rebuilt or repaired.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,5,5,5,4
