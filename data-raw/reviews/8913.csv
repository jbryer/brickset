These little sets are big fun getting 3 little cars for the price of 1. With just 70 pieces you can built 3 cute cars&nbsp;or surprise your kid(s) with a great affordable gift. Add the plastic container in which it comes and the 5 bricks are explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks: Lego gives 6-12 years but a smart 5 year old does the&nbsp;3 jobs too. But loads of fun for young and old(er).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First the Sportscar, a cute little racer with great details namely the moving spoiler and 2 rearview mirrors on the sides. 
<li>Second the small cart, again a lovely car with yellow seat and engine. The mirrorparts now being used as exhaustpipes. Only thing you miss is a minifigure as driver. 
<li>Third the little truck, no specifics here but just remarkable that you can built a real truck with almost the same parts as used for both other cars.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks: nothing really special except the way you can use 70 normal parts in so much different ways in 1 set. A nice amount of different colored small slopes are valuable in this specific set. If a minifigure was included it would have been 5 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks: like said before, 70 small bricks give great fun building 3 nice vehicles and it is fun playing with each separate car.&nbsp;My son called the truck ""Baby Mack"" and parked it immediatly&nbsp;inside the Mack truck he ownes, the racing car was promoted the opponent of Lightning McQueen&nbsp;. No need to say more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: all Creator sets offer 3 different ways to built it so that is already good but this much fun for only â‚¬ 5,99 is a bargon in my opinion. </p>
