<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Comes in a light blue canister which will be useful in the future for a kind of part storage. The instructions show the steps of three vehicles' build: a fire truck, a fire jeep and a helicopter.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Consists of 69 useful pieces in a great assortment. Plates, tiles, bricks and so on, mainly in red and light grey colour.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I've tried firstly all of the 'official' vehicles. The fire truck is neat, maybe its front is too big. The jeep isn't bad, but not the best. The helicopter is a great idea, it's creative too. But the best part is when you build something by yourself! I made a lorry, a race car and a robot, so it's really a 'creator' set.<br></p>

<h4>Summary</h4><p>I like this one like the other mini creator sets. Maybe it's a little bit pricey, but it's full of ideas! In conclusion, it's a creative set with useful parts.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
