<p>I collect LEGO aircrafts, but don't really play with them. During building and as an aircraft enthusiast I found three things I would have made different.</p><p><br></p><p>1: The engines are placed to far out on the wing, I would like to have them closer to the fuselage. This is not too difficult to modify.<br></p><p><br></p><p>2: The cargodrop is facing forward, I would like to have it facing backwards. A trickier modification, but would make it more realistic. Although with a rearward facing cargodrop I guess you might get all the 'water' in your hand when opening the bay while playing.<br></p><p><br></p><p>3: There could have been two small round green bricks to put on top of the trees to conceal the grey rod inside the tree trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall a great kit with lot of playvalue. An unusual but interesting subject and a great addition if you collect LEGO aircrafts or fire kits.</p><p><br></p><p>Aviator<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Rickenbacker","2013-01-22T13:48:48.637Z","Great value for money, and a fun build","<p>This is a neat little set, complete with a forest fire (well, two built-up trees and some transparent orange flames), a ground unit in a jeep and a firebomber plane with loads of 'water' bricks to douse the flames with. I got lucky and picked it up for about â‚¬35 on sale, so for me it was a great deal.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Two (or four, counting the trees) neat models in one box.</li><li>Fun builds, especially the plane itself.</li><li>Lots of pieces, and very worth it since it currently seems to be on sale everywhere.</li><li>Very playable, with the water filling and dumping mechanisms.</li><li>Sturdy and eminently swooshable airplane, that looks great.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The plane looks odd with the engines so far out on the wings - that'd never happen on a real plane.</li><li>The nose piece and the side walls don't align. Maybe this is just on mine, but the thin nose piece isn't supported enough internally at the back, so it's slightly narrower than the walls.</li><li>The 'water' bricks are going to end up behind couches, in cracks and everywhere, when your child dumps them on the floor. No big deal if you don't plan on using them.</li></ul>In all, this is two mid-sized, fun builds in one box. And once built, this set should be very playable, with plenty to do, three nice minifigs to play with and of course the plane to swoosh around, fill with 'water' (transparent, light blue, round 1x1 bricks) and dump them out on the burning trees. Might be hard to find them again, though.",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
"legodan1974","2013-05-27T12:47:00.56Z","Great play for the kids","I buy several lego sets for my 5 year old.. Star Wars, City, etc.&nbsp; This one was instantly his favorite, with so many obvious things for him to do straight away:&nbsp; Drop water on the burning trees, fill the plane's water tanks with the jeep's fire hose, etc.&nbsp; <br><br>I love the orange fireman figure and the chain saw.&nbsp; I sawed a few trees down before they caught on fire.&nbsp; My kid water bombed them anyway.<br><br>Great set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Gerbil","2015-08-01T17:31:52.28Z","Great variety and play options","<p>I&#39;ve seen this set on sale for a few years at varying levels of discount, but it never interested me until recently when it was at half price (which in Colombia&nbsp;where I am, means it was finally less than the MSRP). I felt like I didn&#39;t really need more red pieces as I use them so often, but I&#39;ve never had a plane before, so...</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The plane is very nice looking and bigger than I expected.</li>
	<li>The trees are a very welcome addition to the set. Decent trees are few and far between in the City line.</li>
	<li>30 blue cylinders! I love these, although not as water - I use them as jars and bottles in my MOCs :)</li>
	<li>The chainsaw rocks!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The trailer could have made use of its space a bit better. Everything sits on top of the trailer, making it quite chunky.</li>
	<li>You can&#39;t access the rear part of the plane, although it has detailling inside.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I was impressed. The separate builds are all individually great (although obviously the two trees are identical minus the flames on one), and the plane in particular is fantastic (the wing details are really nice and feature the odd unusual building technique). I already have too many fire trucks, so this one will be broken down for parts, and the trees will be reused for bigger and more realistic trees, but as they are they are probably the best ones you&#39;ll find out of the box for any City set, and it comes with two!</p>

<p>If you like planes or the Fire Brigade line, you shouldn&#39;t miss this!</p>
