"Graysmith","2012-01-10T10:32:14.627Z","For All Your Forest Fire Needs","<div>If you’re curious about the new forest firefighters but feel unsure about splurging on one of the larger sets, this is a great introduction. You’ll get one of the nicer-looking ATV-type vehicles of this size that I’ve seen in quite some time, and you’ll get a very complete firefighter to go with it. This generous set includes the standard axe, extinguisher and breathing apparatus but also a very funky-looking chainsaw made up of five pieces that the minifigure can hold with both hands. That makes it far more realistic and fun than the one-piece chainsaw accessory that has been included in many previous firefighter sets.</div><div><br></div><div>While I still think the standard City firefighters look a bit better overall I do love seeing LEGO trying something radically different with these new firefighters, and the yellow uniforms certainly fit far better with the forest fire theme. They may not be my absolute favourite, but they are still a very welcome addition to the LEGO family of firefighters.</div><div><br></div><div>My only complaint would be that the air tanks on the firefighter’s back are in the standard yellow and not in the more orange-y yellow of the uniform. I can’t help but think it would’ve looked much better if the air tanks were the same colour as the uniform or a more contrasting one (like dark red, matching the helmet). A very minor complaint, though.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bottom line</b>: A great, inexpensive sampler of the new firefighters with plenty of accessories and a very nice ATV. This one should be a no-brainer if you love LEGO firefighters, but it's well worth picking up even if you're not.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

Anyhow, I this was a very well designed atv that looks really cool (well proportioned, sturdy, good detail parts like the tool rack, blue spotlight, and fire extinguisher. This set also comes with a lot of cool parts despite its small size. It rolls around very well too.",FALSE,4,5,5,4,4
"upsbud83","2012-02-12T21:55:33.913Z","Perfect set for the money","<p>The Fire ATV (4427) is a perfect addition to your Lego collection. For $6, you get a great looking ATV with 1 minifigure, chainsaw, fire extinguisher, and&nbsp;ax. I bought this set because it's a perfect choice for a low cost way of getting quality parts, including 2 white grills, 4 small tires, 2 red curved fenders, 1 small hand rail, and 2 cool bright orange round 1x1s.</p><p><br></p><p>The minifigure is awesome. He has a bright yellow suit and a cool helmet. He will make an excellent&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to the engine&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;crew of my spaceship...now if I can just do something with that red helmet.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Value for the money</li><li>Cool pieces</li><li>Nice quality Minifigure</li></ul>

"Rickenbacker","2013-01-24T09:40:52.397Z","Simple, yet fun set.","<p>A nice little set with a fireman and his ATV, plus oodles of equipment for him.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was a little big for the parts, could have been smaller. But the print is colorful and shows off the set nicely.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For such a small set, there are a lot of intersting parts here. Particularly the tools for the minifig, and the cool breathing apparatus that fits perfectly with the fireman's hat.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>One fireman, with an axe, chainsaw, fire extinguisher and breating apparatus. I really like the printed bright yellow body, and all the extra equipment. The face print is nicely done too, with a bead of sweat on one temple.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very short, but surprisingly involved for such a small set. Still, I had fun with it for a few minutes.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks good, rolls with a nice sound and feel on the table and has lots of playability for anyone.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A fun little set, easy to put together, and very playable. And the minifig is, in all its simplicity, one of my favorites so far.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Chills","2013-01-28T08:51:57.397Z","A fun, inexpensive set.","<p>I don't have too many City sets, most of my collection revolves around Star Wars, but I was given this set for Christmas and I must say I think I need to start collecting more City sets; this one is really great.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: I'll start with the minifigure. He's got really nice detail, printed legs, front torso and back, along with a breathing apparatus that slides over the head and attaches to the air tanks. A mask clicks into place on the apparatus and is topped with the traditional fireman's helmet. I must say I was pleased to see the old-fashioned air tanks used. The Space sets I had as a kid has the same ones. <br></li><li>Pro 2: The ATV is a cool little design. It has big tires and fenders, the appropriate lights for an emergency vehicle, and spots for all the tools. The tools are a fire extinguisher, a chainsaw, and an ax, all nicely done.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The build was straight-forward but enjoyable, and the pieces used are all pretty standard, as are the colors.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I think the only thing Lego should have put in is a small tree that's on fire; a fireman needs a fire to fight.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is a pretty cool little set; it has nice playability for a small set, it's inexpensive, and the minifigure has wonderful detail. It has got me looking at more City sets to start collecting; I have my eye on the Fire Plane, now. I would recommend this set for any collector or even young ones that love Lego.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"vikings","2020-06-11T00:01:08.663Z","Nice Little ATV","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 4.8 x 3.6 x 2.3 inches and weighs 0.15 pounds. It comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice parts in this set. You get a black axe, a dark grey chainsaw, and a light grey handle. Other than that there isn&#39;t any other pieces that you don&#39;t get in any other set. The total piece count for the set is 50. Overall a pretty basic piece haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Firefighter:</strong></p>

<p>The firefighter is the highlight of set for me. He is fully equipped with all his gear and looks great. He has a dark grey mask base with a trans dark&nbsp;grey visor and a maroon firefighter hat. He has yellow oxygen tanks and single sided head. On the head he has a beard, a scrape on the right side of his face, and a slight grin as a facial expression. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have the more classic firefighter uniform with the big yellow jacket. You have a brown belt and a pocket on the upper left part of his chest. On the back you have a flame of a fire in a red shield with the brown belt on the back as well. He also has printing on his legs showing some light grey and dark tan/light brown markings. He can use either the black axe, the brick built chainsaw (which is an amazing thing to get in this set), or the yellow fire extinguisher.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice Fire ATV. The firefighter is a great figure to get and is done very well. The ATV itself&nbsp;is nice. On the front you have a clip to put the fire extinguisher and on the back you have another two clips to put the black axe and brick built chainsaw. The brick built chainsaw is amazing. It looks great and have two light grey nozzles as handles. The ATV moves very nicely and doesn&#39;t catch on anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend this set to any Lego city collector. This isn&#39;t a must-have, but will still make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"CityIsAwesomne","2018-12-02T09:33:37.31Z","A Fun and Cheap Little Set","<p>Lego City during 2012 was mostly focusing on mines and forest fires, especially mines. But we&#39;re talking about the forest fire sets now. The smallest one is 4427 which consists of a fire ATV and a minifigure.</p>

<p>As said above it consists of one ATV, or just all-terrain vehicle. It&#39;s pretty small but it&#39;s quite fun as it offers some playability, it also comes with a saw and a yellow fire-extinguisher. It offers some playability but way more of you have another forest fire set as well as it doesn&#39;t really come with any burning trees or so on.</p>

<p>It comes with one minifigure, a forest fireman with a dark red helmet and air tanks and some other gadgets to protect him from the fire. He also grins because why not and he like other forest firemen come with yellow clothing. He is overall a good minifigure and you can even play that he is evil due to his grin maybe? I actually thought he was evil at first when I got the set.</p>

<p>The playability level is would probably get a four due to the minifigure&#39;s grin and that the set comes with a quite good ATV and some gadgets with it like a fire-extinguisher and a saw, however there isn&#39;t really anything in the set like a burning tree to extinguish the fire so that&#39;s a minus</p>

<p>The value for money is quite good though as it&#39;s only really from five bucks to ten bucks, that&#39;s what I call a deal! So yeah the value for money is quite good here.</p>

<p>Final Score: <strong>3,5/5</strong> or <strong>7/10</strong>. If you&#39;re looking for a cheap set that is quite good this is for you, the gadgets included are pretty good and the minifigure&#39;s grin makes for many different playing styles. However if you want some burning trees and stuff then I&#39;d maybe suggest getting another forest fire set first, and then this one</p>

"StevenTheBrick","2021-12-19T23:00:56.83Z","Fire ATV","<p>&nbsp; 2/5</p>

<p>The Fire ATV was a bit overpriced&nbsp;for its price back then in 2012. $6 for a minifigure and an ATV. Doesn&#39;t hold up much today, as it would possibly be a $5 polybag. But even then, a firefighter in a cheap set was good to have back then. Not much of a building experience and parts not as impressive as of today. Playability is ok for younger fans, but they would most likely prefer bigger builds such as fire trucks.</p>
