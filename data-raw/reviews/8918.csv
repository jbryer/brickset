"Firox_5000","2012-02-14T16:59:40.443Z","Triceratops Attack","<p>This was my first dino set which I bought at my local toy shop for £39.99. The set contains 271 pieces and took me around 30 minutes to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The finished model features two hunter minifigures one of them with printed shades on his face and the other with a more normal face which is also reversable too and shows off a scared and brave face. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dino featured in this set is massive triceratops. The arms and head are all individual pieces and the head also comes in it's own box for protection. The finished dino is superb and features lots of wide details including spikes, a tail as well as the ability to move the legs and head. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than the figures and dino, the main [and only] object to the set is a fairly big four wheeled dino hunter truck in which the model itself is very robust when finished building. The set features a range of tools at the side of the truck such as dino tranquiliser guns as well as a shovel and spade. The model also features spikes at the front as well as a cockpit which can hold one figure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as that, the truck also comes with a detachable cage which can hold the triceratops inside when it's captured and fits perfectly on the truck. The model also comes with flick missiles at the front of the truck too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of this model on it's own is fairly durable with two figures, a truck and a triceratops however adding other dino sets may be suggested to maximise the models play value. Overall, I find the model to be of an excellent standard. My only major complaint of the product is the cost at £39.99 for two figures, a dino and a medium sized vehicle resulting in 271 pieces alot of money. Eventhough the cost of the moulding for the triceratops is a reason to justify the higher asking price as it has lots of meaty plastic parts, I still find it costs too much. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When compared with the 2009 thunder driller which is slightly smaller but yet £18.00 less really shows the value of lego playsets is declining. With the reflection of price inflation and as mentioned the head moulding, a more justifying price for this model would have been £29.99.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend this model to any one who likes Lego dinosaurs, heavy four wheel trucks and anyone who likes classic lego. However if you are shaky about whether or not to buy any lego dino sets, I don't recommend buying this set first because it feels somewhat empty when it's alone. If you want a set to see whether you like the theme, I would suggest buying &nbsp;either the raptor chase or ambush attack sets first. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,2
"alexfig8","2013-12-10T20:28:44.697Z","Great set for $50!","<p>I got this set in 2012 when I was sick. &nbsp;I built it in bed, and was pleasantly surprised with this set, considering I didn't have high expectations for it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is fairly large and depicts the truck doing what is made for, capturing a Triceratops</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The set contains quite a few yellow parts, as well as large wheels which are useful, some grate parts that make up the cage, and other useful random parts.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>This set includes two dino hunter minifigs. &nbsp;They both include tranquilizer guns, and their torsos are exclusive to the Dino theme. &nbsp;It also includes a Triceratops (not-really) minifigure. &nbsp;It is rather large, and has a poseable head due to it being a separate part. &nbsp;It is mostly plastic, with parts of the head being rubber</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>I don't remember how many bags this set had, but the build was a rather quick one based on its size, probably only about 45 minutes or so. &nbsp;You first build the truck then the cage for capturing dinosaurs.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>This truck is MASIVE! &nbsp;It towers over the tiny minifigs! &nbsp;The front has some cool spikes on the bumper. &nbsp;The cab seats one figure. &nbsp;The cage on the back can be unloaded to make the truck just a flatbed truck, which with a few modifications can be repurposed into a dump truck, for example. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><h4>&nbsp;I think this is a good set for the price, which was $50. &nbsp;If you can find it for less that $75, I would get it. &nbsp;It doesn't look like much, but it's worth it!</h4>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"123MrBrick","2015-06-21T03:24:06.947Z","Great Dino Set","<p>This review is best read with the recommended music: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHalXjs0cDA"">Click here</a> I love this set. An exclusive minifig, a great dinosaur, and a massive, beefy truck. However, it does feel a bit... one-sided.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box of the era. Front shows the action shot, back shows the features. Instructions I believe were spread over two manuals.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many special parts, although the Triceratops was, and still is, entirely unique to this set. The gigantic tires and wheels are a lot of fun to mess with and would be good for MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes 3 minifigures. These are the <strong>Triceratops</strong>; the dude with the brown helmet, who, for simplicity, I will call <strong>Driver, </strong>given the fact that driving is his usual role; and the other guy, who I will call <strong>Shades.</strong> The Triceratops is huge and is made of six parts. All of the legs are poseable, as is the head. Driver is a fairly basic Dino minifig, and is included in three other sets. Shades has some awesome sunglasses and a torso print reminiscent of the<br />
Dino Attack theme of old. He is exclusive to this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this model was fairly simple. The set has around 300 pieces, many of which are large, beefy bricks to give the truck its huge form. I took around an hour to complete it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is great. I love how absolutely huge the truck and dino are. The truck has two pairs of flick-fire missiles and a detachable Triceratops cage. The yellow and maroon look great together and really make this model pop on a shelf.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I love this set. It is huge and fun. I do feel that play value is a bit limited though, because there is not much to do besides put the Triceratops in the cage. It is still definitely a Dino set you need to get.</p>

The box art shows the triceratops trapper chasing a dinosaur (a triceratops, obviously) away from the city.

It really dwaves the other cars/trucks in the theme! There aware only 2 flaws in this set: with two little bar areas, this couldn't hold a triceratops. And the second one the flick-fire missiles always spin around when you try to shoot them.
