<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box of the era. Front shows actions, back shows features. I believe this set only had one manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are not many unique parts in this set. Until recently, the Pterodactyl was exclusive to the Dino theme. I think the three yellow fins are only in this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with three figures. They are the <strong>Pterodactyl, </strong>the <strong>Pilot </strong>(named so by me for simplicity) and <strong>Blondy McBlondBlond. </strong>(also named so for &quot;simplicity&quot;) The Pterodactyl is the same as the one in Tower Takedown, but with a new color scheme. He has an articulated beak and flapping wings. The feet can grip on to poles and other objects. The Pilot coincidentally also appears in Tower Takedown and has not changed since his last Pterodactyl encounter. He has fairly basic printing on is torso and head. His legs are left blank. Blondy is only available in this set, and stands out to me among Dino theme figures. He also has fairly basic printing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly simple, and, due to the symmetric nature of the model, repetitive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great and has three features: a boat that can detach from the lower section for Blondy to ride, a flick-fire missile on the top, and a dropping net to capture the Pterodactyl. All of the features work nicely. The boat in this set is far superior to the one included in Tower Takedown.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set. It&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s not great. As I mentioned before, it feels tilted towards the humans. I feel the price could have been better justified with the inclusion of maybe another small vehicle or another Pterodactyl. However, any Dino set is worth picking up for a fair price.</p>
