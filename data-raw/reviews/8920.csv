"sw999","2012-01-14T14:09:57.71Z","Must go faster...","<p>Being a huge fan of Jurassic Park, Dinosaurs (just look at my 
username), and the previous Lego Dinosaur lines (Dino Attack, Dino 
Island, and Dinosaurs), I knew that this would be a line in which I 
would get multiple, if not all, of the sets. Besides the HQ and the hard
 to find Pteranodon Chase set, I managed to get nearly all of them in 
December. All of them are very cool sets with good minifigures, fun 
vehicles with interesting gimmicks, and amazing Dinosaurs. The T-Rex Hunter set is one of two sets that has the Tyrannosaurus rex (the other being the Dino Defense HQ). <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Being a large set, is has multiple bags and 
instruction sheets. The box, while big, is very slim and is probably as 
thick as the smaller sets, something that Lego did around the time the 
Pharaoh's Quest line came out. The box also has some nice images that 
show the set in action.<br>
<br>

<h4>Parts</h4>
<ul><li>The camera is an interesting piece and I really like it. I don't 
think it's a new piece, though. There are also a few other various 
devices.<br>
  </li><li>The gun is a very cool new piece. It has a clip on top to place the green syringe, showing that these are tranquilizing guns. <br>
  </li><li>The biggest and most important piece - the Tyrannosaurus rex. While previous T-Rexes were pretty good, this one blows them away.  The Tyrannosaur
 has a very nice red/orange/brown color scheme that looks a lot better 
in person. His head, jaw, arms, and legs are all articulated. He manages
 to convey the ferocity and size and playability of the Dino Attack 
mutant T-Rex while also being realistic like the Dino Island and 
Dinosaurs T-Rexes. I absolutely love it.<br>
  </li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<ul><li>The pilot in the green jumpsuit is a pretty cool figure. The beads
 of sweat actually look pretty nice, considering his difficult 
situation. He's also available in the Tower Takedown set.</li><li>The photographer figure is also a nice minifigure. The promotion pictures show him with burgundy arms, but they're more of a brown, which looks much better. I wish he had a double-sided head, though, as he'll be forever stuck looking nervous.<br>
  </li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>

<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was alright, I suppose. I did the first bag in a short 
amount of time and then waited a bit for the actual helicopter. It 
didn't take too long, but it got a little repetitive with the rotors and
 the legs of the vehicle, but I guess that's only expected with a 
symmetrical vehicle. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model was much better than I expected. While I knew the
 minifigures, accessories, and the Dinosaur would be great (refer to the
 previous sections), the vehicles were much better than I thought. <br>
</p>
<ul><li>The photographer's little Jeep is alright. It's a charming little 
vehicle and makes for a decent scouting car. I do like the little box 
and trailer attachment, though.</li><li>The capture claw that attaches to the T-Rex does it's part. It's nice and sturdy and won't fall off the T-Rex.</li><li>The helicopter is the most surprising part of the set. I was originally going to avoid this set and just buy the HQ, but 
I'm glad I got this, as the helicopter is really fun. I've had oodles of
 fun with the helicopter and the gimmick. I'd recommend altering chained
 hook, though. It's better if the ball is facing the cockpit and the 
hook is pointing up. It holds onto the capture claw much easier that 
way. The big rotors are also s little wobbly, though, and the turbines 
above the cockpit and below the rotors are a little frail and they 
sometimes get in the way of the spinning rotors.<br>
  </li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>T-Rex hunter is an awesome set. The helicopter is 
much better than I expected, it has nice minifigures, and an amazing 
Tyrannosaurus. It seemed a little expensive, but the Tyrannosaur and the
 helicopter are very big and the set is a lot of fun once you complete 
it. If, however, you <span style=""font-style: italic;"">only</span> want the Dinos and don't care for the vehicles (all of them are spectacular in my 
opinion, I like them a lot more than I expected), then just spend the 
extra $30 and buy the HQ to get the three carnivorous Dinosaurs, but if 
you do like the vehicles, I highly recommend this set. ",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Bram","2012-03-02T04:32:19.15Z","Totally blown away! Remarkable set!","The Dino theme is a pretty much my childhood play scenario,- resurrected from the 80's. As little boys we must admit, the thought of a dinosaur stomping about our mini diecast cars is REALLY fun. Being a 'sensible' adult..I just couldn't resist the Dino theme.<br><br>Being an avid aircraft enthusiast, the 5886 is just a few of Lego's accurate depiction of a real world aircraft. The thing that caught my eyes was how accurately it resembles the S-64 Sikorsky Skycrane heavylift helicopter, designwise and sizewise. And also for the fact that you get that mean T-Rex as its cargo LOL.&nbsp; Here's the real thing :<br><br><span>[img]http://www.bush-planes.com/images/SikorskySkyCrane.jpg[/img]</span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Build impression</span><br>The box&nbsp; art doesn't really emphasize how huge the helicopter will be. More on that later.<br>Open the box you get 4 numbered bags,interconnecting bags containing parts for the 'bad guy' (T-rex), a carboard backed instructions and sticker (YAY, no more wrinkles).&nbsp; We start off in typical Lego manner with minifig assembly, the T-rex and the buggy. The assembly is pretty much straight forward and simple, even made simpler with the numbered bags which correspond with steps in the instructions. <br>Instruction #1 : minifig, T-rex, helicopter main fuselage and turbine engines.<br>Instruction #2 : landing gears, cockpit and the main rotor assembly (really big!)<br>There are no new parts other than the dark red colored parts.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post build impression</span><br>Now, the fun part...<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Minifig</span> : You get two figs as a pilot with a WWII fighter like leather helmet, a goggle. The torso is printed fore and aft with a very detailed harness, and what looks like bottles of Gatorade on his belt. Make sense because he's face is sweating. And yes the face sadly is only single sided print. The other fig is a photographer/archaeologist. He comes with a slightly terrified face, and unshaved facial hair.Torso is nicely printed in with an safari explorer type vest. You get two rifles with a yellowish green syringe..which is supposed to be a tranquilizer. He has a very nice looking 'DSLR camera' and a binocullar. The head and torso prints on these figs are just superb, full of details.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">'Bad guy'</span> : The star of the set is no doubt the T-Rex. He comes with many articulated points so you can pose him anyway you like. The joints are actually toggle joints, they lock in place to 'hold' a pose but can altered easily with usual 'click' sound. The sculpting of the head is just awesome. The lower jaw is seperated so you can make him grin or roar. LOL. the head moves up and down, sway side to side. Nice! He's dark red colored complimeted by brown on the lower half and black printed pattern. This red color shade screams 'carnivore', much better than the green one you get in the #5887, which looks like a 'vegetarian'. Hahahaha<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Buggy : </span>A nice yellow ATV with a trailer and box to store the archeologist's equipment. The curved bricks on the nose&nbsp; is surprisingly printed! Comes with 2 clips to store the two included rifles.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Helicopter</span> : T-Rex being the 'star', the helicopter is THE spotlight! Man, I just can't stop admiring this beauty! First of all..it's HUGE!! The T-rex can walk and crouch beneath the fuselage with it's tail tucked way inside the tailboom, just to get the idea. And also pretty heavy, 70% of the box's weight goes here. The 'S-64 Sikorsky Skycrane' -esque is nicely captured and just looks imposing. From the backbone fuselage, to the outward angled landing gears, the highly detailed turbofan engines and the very spacious 8-wide cockpit. Top all these with a huge six- blade rotor. The details on the rotor is just amazing.This is by far the largest helo Lego has ever made,,even the new #4439 Police helicopter seems 'small &amp; tame' compared to this behemoth. Why so big? When you're lifting a 9 ton carnivore, you wanna make sure it does the job..The helicopter comes with a capture brackets which fits nicely over the T-rex's torso.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict <br>Pros:</span><br>- Seemingly expensive (price per piece) set, but with a HUGE kick..literally!<br>- Largest helicopter ever, which can be used in a heavy lift 'City' construction duties<br>- Nicely printed and detailed figs.<br>- Endless playability with the included accessories<br>- One bad-a** dinosaur..exclusive to this set which comes in dark red, compared with the 'veggies' green version of the same T-rex in the 5887<br>-Not a fantasy set..the Skycrane helicopter does exist in real life!<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons</span> :<br>-Won't fit on regular display shelves. LOL<br>-Single sided prints on heads..why????<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Score : 9.5/10..I'm totally blown away!</span> Remarkable set!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Arcana","2012-07-17T19:41:17.887Z","Need to spice up your LEGO scenes? Add a T-Rex.","Do you ever get bored with looking at your LEGO sets? Do you feel that they've lost some of their playability, or do you sometimes wonder why, even after you've spent hundreds of dollars on castles, houses, police stations, and spaceships, there's still something boring about them?<br><br>The answer to these problems is simple. Add a T-Rex.<br><br>Any ordinary, boring LEGO scene comes to live when you add a T-Rex! Police running out of criminals to catch? Add a T-Rex and suddenly you have a whole new scenario to act out. Medieval Market Village a little boring? Add a T-Rex and you have hilarious photos to share over your Facebook (guilty as charged). X-Wing destroyed that TIE Fighter too many times? Add a T-Rex and Luke Skywalker'll need all of his Force powers to get him out of this one.<br><br>As you can tell from my review, the main reason to get this set is for the T-Rex. This figure is absolutely great. He fits onto most plates (though he requires a lot of room, something like 10 studs across), his little T-Rex arms hold standard minifigure accessories (yes, your T-Rex can hold a turkey drumstick), and he has a set of studs on his back so that you can make a T-Rex saddle and have Commander Cow ride him on his offensive rampage (yes, also guilty as charged). The T-Rex is a very large figure. I've not measured him but it's definitely the largest LEGO figure I've ever seen.<br><br>The helicopter is also something else. As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is a very large vehicle - it's larger than even the T-Rex himself, and looks very impressive on the shelf. It's very detailed and was a delight to build - there were a number of interesting decorations added using well-matched Technic pieces. The engines were fun to build, and the cockpit looks excellent, especially with the very large and wide windshield. The chain that comes attached to the aircrane is a little flimsy, since it's soft plastic, but I'm not sure that LEGO could have done anything better. The playability is great - simply hook the crane into some loop. The ""swooshability"" is definitely here because of that crane attachment. Hook up the T-Rex and swoosh! Bored of that? Go haul around a house, or a Star Wars starfighter, or the trailer of a semi-truck.<br><br>To round out this set we also have a little vehicle. It's a small jeep or truck and while it's very simple it's something that adds to the playability of this set.<br><br>The two minifigures are very fitting to this set. I'm not a minifigure buff so I tend not to obsess over their details, but they have nice prints on their legs that match their respective roles as a chopper pilot and an archeologist (or perhaps a big-game hunter!). The pilot has a sweat drop on his face, which is a cute detail. They both come with rifles (including a little tiny tranquilizer dart). The archeologist also has a little camera which is an extremely cute piece.<br><br>When it's all done, it's a very impressive set and looks much bigger than its 480 pieces might imply. While the set is a little on the expensive side, rest assured that the T-Rex likely makes up a huge portion of the cost. This set really brings out the kid in me.<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Dino_Aidan","2012-12-01T11:12:17.343Z","T-Rex Helicopter Lifter ","<p>The helicopter is almost as big as a real Bald eagle. &nbsp;The T-Rex is pretty cool because the snapping jaws are fun to use. &nbsp;The ATV only has one guy but is pretty good.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions were good - I got a little bit mixed up and needed some help from my dad.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The fans for the helicopter are pretty cool - I have never seen blades this long before. &nbsp;I thought that the back rotor was going to be as big as the seaplane but they were actually a little smaller. &nbsp;The chain is not very long - it just touches the ground when the helicopter is landed.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The guy who drives the ATV did not have a helmet - he could get hurt if the vehicle crashes. &nbsp;The guy who drives the helicopter has a pretty cool helmet.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>I needed some help from my dad. &nbsp;After it was built I had some problems with the central structure breaking and the landing legs falling off. &nbsp;Also, the cabin would become separated. &nbsp;I reinforced it so that the legs would stay in place.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>I like it. &nbsp;It is my favourite helicopter because it is the biggest one I own and the only lifing helicopter that I have. &nbsp;I really like the fact that it is a heavy lift helicopter.</div><div><br></div><div>The T-Rex is red and black on the top and brown on the bottom. &nbsp;the toes and teeth are white. &nbsp;His legs and arms are posable with a sturdy 'clicking' mechanism. The tail also turns but I kind of wish it didn't. &nbsp;The head is also very posable &nbsp;- it spins and tilts up and down and the jawbone also uses a click-mechanism as it opens. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I had a lot of fun building and playing with this set. &nbsp;I am thinking about also getting the HQ.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
