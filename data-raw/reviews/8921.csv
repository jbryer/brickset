"JBH75","2011-12-29T00:42:27.4Z","No surprises here, except for the raptor in the bushes","Since there's no review of this set yet, and as I did receive this set for christmas (to be precise, got trampled on at the sherway lego store to buy it on Boxing Day) and was satisfied with it at its price of $39.99. It seems necessary to review this one. Alright, time to break this thing down. The format will be similar to the Tower Takedown set.<div><br></div><div>This set includes two minifigures, various accessories, 1 dinosaur, and barricade/outpost of sorts, and a dino-wrangler jeep used to tranquilize and capture the dinosaurs. The color scheme is a very nice yellow and dark red, which reminds me a lot of Dino Attack where a lot of dark red was used. It gives it a nice jurassic park feel to it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>The minifigures:</h4><div><ul><li>The set has 2 minifigures in it, both with double-sided torsos, 1 new face, and only 1 of the minifigures has leg printing</li><li>The new face isn't double-sided, but the other mini-figure does have a double-sided face: one side happy, one side scared.</li><li>The headgear is an Indiana Jones hat in a tan color and a pilot helmet (no goggles)</li></ul>Overall, the minifigures are very nice. It's worth mentioning that the minifigure with the helmet was in the Ambush Attack set as well, so he gets thrown into sets a lot. He's&nbsp;supposed to be a rookie or something.&nbsp;I don't like that Lego does that, but a minifigure is a minifigure.</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories/Equipment:</h4><div><ul><li>The tranquilizer gun, (dark grey rifle, with clip on it for attachment of green syrettes or a scope) is included</li><li>2 syrettes are included for attachment, but mine gave 3. Although it's a new piece, there's a bit of a problem between syrette to gun ratio.&nbsp;</li><li>Various tools are included: A black wrench, a black hatchet, and a red crowbar (my first)</li><li>A turkey drumstick is also included for the use of baiting the dino. You can never have too much of those.</li><li>Though they aren't really accessories, i'll mention them anyway. There's a bit of plant pieces in this set for the barricade, and plants are always nice.</li></ul>Lego gave us some good accessories with this set. My only complaint is that the clip on the gun is fixed, so it can't be&nbsp;detached&nbsp;for MOC uses. But that doesn't affect the set overall.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Dinosaur (finally, am i right?)</h4><div><ul><li>Lego's new molding of the raptor is much better than the one from the dino attack (dino 2010) sets. Realistic, but cartoony, just like we all know Lego to be.</li><li>It's unique to this set due its color scheme of olive green with a green stripe pattern. The pattern looks nice on it. Seems like it would blend into the overgrowth easily</li><li>It has studs on its back to place things on it (Dinoriders anyone?)</li><li>Its hands and legs are all attached with technic pins, so you can move them up and down to a degree and use them in MOCs. The hands can also hold rods, as can the raptor toe claws (i love Lego for putting those on them)</li><li>The head is attached with a black technic pin, and can rotate 360 degrees</li><li>The jaw on the raptor also opens and closes. It also locks into position when opened or closed. It isn't loose</li><li>The tail is attached to the body, but is made of rubbery plastic (like the Coelophysis) for limited mobility, but I think that's ok.</li><li>Also, there is separate bagging for the dino in this set, to ensure the parts don't get scratched</li></ul>Overall, this new raptor outshines the older one. It looks so much like the ones from Jurassic park it's not even funny. I'm just glad they kept it lizard-like and didn't give it feathers. Moving the head up and down too would've been nice, but that would have made the neck too fat, so I have no complaints about this raptor.</div><div><br></div><h4>Now for the barricade and the vehicle:</h4><p><b>Barricade</b></p><p></p><ul><li>It's not really that necessary to this set, but it does add some nice accessories and playability to the set</li><li>I like the fence pieces with the spikes on it, the plants and the small console pieces Lego included, but I still don't like the choice of satellite dish design</li><li>It's a decent place of the minifigures to hide their equipment, and hide from the raptor, but i think i'd rather stay in the jeep</li></ul>Overall, the barricade is hit and miss. It works, but at the same time, it isn't necessary. You can use it though to make a nice little base, or make a scenario where you chase the raptor into it. Let your imagination go wild.<p></p><p><br></p><p><b>The Jeep:</b></p><p></p><ul><li>The jeep has a nice build, very symmetrical and it has that jurassic park feeling to it, always nice. The frame may seem large and weird in the beginning, but trust me. It'll make sense once it is built.</li><li>It has some nice large tire pieces, storage clips on the sides for tools, and a nice driver's seat</li><li>There's even grill pieces on the sides to make a sort of ladder to climb into the jeep</li><li>The lights in the back are the new 1X1 round flat pieces in trans-red which are always very nice</li><li>There's actually a lot of trans-parts in this set, including trans-orange 1x2 - 2 stud bar pieces</li><li>There is use of stickers here, but they fit the design very well, though it would've been nicer to see a printed&nbsp;licence&nbsp;plate, or controls for the lasso</li><li><b>Unfortunately, there is nothing under the hood</b>. If you get this set, you should put <b>2 engine pieces</b> under the hood, as the hood piece can be removed and placed back with ease</li><li>The bait and lasso device can be rotated 360 degrees, and the lasso can be moved up and down. The bait and lasso function actually works very well, and if that isn't your style, you can do what I've done and substitute it with a homemade blaster</li><li>The bait device, can even rest atop the windshield which was a good decision on Lego's part</li></ul>Overall, this jeep is very designed. It's a good little unit, and has a lot of playability and possibilities. The only complaint I have is no engine under the hood. C'mon Lego, how could you miss that? There is room in there for an engine by the way.<p></p><p><br></p><p>In conclusion, this set doesn't have too many problems, and has a lot of outstanding points. It delivers everything the box shows you, so no surprises are in store (unless you receive an extra syrette). It's an easy build, and is a must have for Lego fans. Even if you are just getting it for the <b>green raptor</b>. It has good parts, plenty of accessories, and lots of possibilities. It has stickers, but they fit the design, so I wouldn't complain too much. The price should be cheaper to at least $34.99, but Lego's just trying to make us pay for the <b>new dino</b> and that's understandable. This is just my opinion though. Go buy this set, and see for yourself. Tis the season.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading, and Happy Holidays -SB7538</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"hlm5678","2011-12-31T14:59:02.363Z","This is a REALLY cool set.","<p>Review: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set includes a really cool Raptor Dinosaur&nbsp;which is six pieces.The Raptor comes in a separate bag. 1/6 pieces of the Raptor is in Bag 1. There are&nbsp;2 bags and&nbsp;1 manual. There's a SUPER mini-station with a computer (printed), a box/container with a green syringe, crowbar, and binoculars. There is a satellite dish-like thing&nbsp;stuck in a plant and another plant to the side to make it look like a jungle/forest. There are two minifigures, one is plain and&nbsp;one has plenty of details. The plain one is a basic brown&nbsp;Dino hunter with a double-sided face and a scar on his cheek. The other guy is about 50ish. He has a tan cowboy hat, orange facial hair, lots of gear on the torso and legs, and a rifle with a green syringe. The ATVish car is very tall with BIG wheels. The vehicle can fit both figs.(One drives, one controls the crane.) The crane has a rope and a chicken leg to attract the Raptor. The crane can rotate. There are 5 stickers included in this set. 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"dragon_teenager","2012-01-18T13:15:06.933Z","Best value of the Dino line","I received this LEGO set for Christmas, and although I didn't have much initial interest in the Dino line, this set's unexpected charm made me a fan. <br><br>When you open the box, the first thing you'll build is a small outpost of sorts. It is very basic, and I think of it as a parts pack. It includes a nice printed slope, some foliage and four spikes. Additionally, there's a crate of some useful accessories. Beyond that, the function of the outpost is not terribly clear, but I think it does a good job of rounding out the set into a more complete package. <br><br>After that, you'll start building the jeep using the nice numbered bag method that LEGO's adapted in recent years. The jeep is the meat of the set, and I think it's fantastic. The construction is extremely solid, and the finished project feels like an able-bodied vehicle that could easily capture some predatory lizards. There aren't any parts that fall off during play, and the model feels nice and complete. If you need some yellow parts in your collection, this would be a great parts pack - the jeep includes a healthy number of slopes, tiles, planks, cheese slopes, and the like. It does have a crane of sorts attached to the back end of the vehicle. The crane seems to work well enough, and it seems to be intended to capture dinosaurs lured towards the cunningly placed turkey leg. I have trouble believing that this device could actually be used to restrain a raptor, but a little imagination goes a long way. It does include a pair of flick-fire missiles, which seem to be standard-issue these days. I find it annoying, especially because the jeep is already equipped with a crane and a tranquilizer gun intended to peacefully capture the dinos. What are they flick-firing at them? <br><br>This is a minor drawback, however. The jeep has outstanding playability. It has some decent detailing on both the front and the back end of the model. Large wheels make it seem capable of navigating treacherous jungle terrain. There are some stickers, however. Not too many, but they're placed on important parts of the model that seem pretty bare without them. The back end has a yellow plate that is intended to be a license plate - but you wouldn't know it without the sticker. I imagine this could be an issue for those of you who don't like to apply stickers, which would make the back plate seem pretty useless. <br><br>One of the best parts of this set - making it my favorite of the entire Dino line - is the minifig lineup. You only get two minifigures, and one of them appears in pretty much every other set. But the other one is an exclusive, and in my opinion, one of the coolest minifigs of the line. He genuinely looks like a safari veteran, including back printing and an awesome fedora. Definitely a great fig.<br><br>Of course, the set also includes one of the brand-new LEGO dinosaurs. This particular set seems to include a raptor. Each part of the raptor is packaged in an individual bag - it seems that LEGO is taking great care in packaging these toys. The raptor is great, and is pleasingly articulated in all the right ways. The best part is that the raptor actually feels like a LEGO piece, and not a juniorized plastic hunk that the Dino Attack sets suffered from. <br><br>Overall, you get a lot of love for your $30. I don't own any of the other Dino sets (yet), but if they're all as satisfying as this set, I may very well pick them all up.<br><br>I highly recommend this set!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"Paradoxymoron","2012-01-07T17:21:28.89Z","Not that bad.","<p>I got this set about a week before Christmas I think. I thought it would be a good set to go for from this theme, considering it was very big or small. Disregarding the dismaying fact that the ""Raptor"" was not at all a raptor (I'll get to this later), however I grabbed the set nonetheless.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was typical, what you would come to expect from LEGO, with the set displayed in an eye-catching action scene. LEGO's genius, of course, was creating another theme with dinosaurs. I'm sure that they are well aware of how many young children are fascinated by dinosaurs (like I was). Thus, the word ""DINO"" stands out quite well, as does the ""raptor"" itself.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I was further dismayed upon opening the box to discover that the poor ""Raptor"" was missing his left arm. At the time of my purchase, the set was not yet on lego.com, and I discovered that I was unable to ask for a replacement at the time. Regardless of this, I found this dino-fig to be a vast improvement over previous incarnations. He is actually about the same size as the T-Rex from the Adventurers sets.</p><p>Other special pieces include the lime green syringes, the new gun piece, and the red crowbar (which I, being one who does not collect City sets, did not previously have).</p><p>Aside from that, this set is pretty much just a mass of yellow pieces, with a bit of black and dark red. Some parts may be in new colors, but aside from that and what was previously mentioned, there is not much which is special here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are not outstanding, however they are still pretty good, and embody the theme quite well.</p>The first minifigure has a brown pilot helmet, a double sided head (one happy and one scared, as is typical of double sided heads), a nicely printed dark red torso (front AND back printing), and dark tan legs, which are unfortunately boring.<br><br>The second minifig has a dark tan fedora, a single sided head, a brown torso which also has front and back printing, but is unfortunately less interesting, and dark tan legs with some nice printing. The overall design of this figure seems to suggest that he is the hunter, whereas the other is evidently just the driver.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was nothing atypical. The small ""base"" is, as previously stated, nothing to be excited about. It contains a few nice pieces, but does not look the part, and really does not fit the overall action of the set.<br></p><p>The ""Raptor"" is pretty much just snapping some technic pins together. It actually takes longer to open the critter's special bag than it does to assemble him. <br></p><br>The truck is really nothing different from most other trucks. I will admit I was surprised at the large empty space under the hood. I'm not sure why, but I was expecting some small action feature to be hidden under the hood. I guess the one time I expect it, it doesn't happen.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The truck really isn't all that horrible to look at. It does have <span style=""font-style: italic;"">a</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">lot</span> of yellow on it though. The dino-catching mechanism is rather cool -if impractical- and is vaguely reminiscent of some of the vehicles from the second Jurassic Park movie. Really though, the truck looks to be quite tough, seems to be the perfect choice to go up against our dinosaur friend. One minor thing which I just found (and is just me being nit picky) is that the ladders don't really down far enough for the minifigures. Then again, I doubt it will really matter to those who actually intend to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">play with</span> the set anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>The dino is excellent, having a moving head, moving arms and legs, and an opening mouth (although I would advise against opening his mouth. The bottom jaw has a most unattractive design).<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>And here's where I complain. As previously mentioned, I was <span style=""font-style: italic;"">extremely </span>into dinosaurs when I was younger (so be prepared for a rant). I amassed large quantities of information about various types of dinosaurs, as well as some pterosaurs. So what bothers me? This is not a raptor. Don't get me wrong, the dinosaur is an excellent figure. It just is not a raptor. Velociraptors (which I am assuming this thing is supposed to be) were not that big (a fact that I am willing to overlook due to the fact that the dinosaur would instead have to be smaller than the minifigures, a feat which is highly unlikely from a toy). Further, velociraptors had feathers. And, to be even more of a critic, the hands of a velociraptor faced each other (as opposed to the ground) and were fixed in that position. There are more problems I could point out (such as how velociraptors had wings) but I think you get the idea. He <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is</span> an excellent figure. Nevertheless, he is a poor representation of a velociraptor.</p><p>Now that my ranting is through, the set really is not that bad. I doubt that many young children will really care how accurate the ""Raptor"" really is, and I'm sure very few others care either. The set has a fair amount of playability, allowing the minifigs to stake out at their small base and wait for a raptor to pass by. Then they can board their truck and give chase. That is the best scenario my mind can concoct, but I'm sure a small child could invent a plethora of situations to plague our heroic minifigs with. <br></p><p>All in all, a fairly good set, and a good introduction to the DINO series.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"baylego","2012-01-01T18:39:39.01Z","Mediocre Vehicle, Excellent Raptor","I&nbsp;received&nbsp;this set as a Christmas gift, and proceeded to build it first. I was excited by the minifigures but generally&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;by the rest of the set.<div><h4>The Minifigures</h4><div>When I built the raptor, I was really impressed by all of the degrees of movement it had. I still have the Dino Attack sets from when I was little, and these new dinosaurs are a huge improvement over the old ones in terms of playability and realism. I also really liked the rugged cowboy looking character. He is very unique and and adds some variety to the line.</div><h4>The Parts</h4><div>Aside from the raptor and minifigures, this set had nothing that caught my interest other than the tires which were new to my collection.</div><h4>The Build</h4><div>The build was standard for a vehicle. The small base felt fairly worthless, and it was really boring building it. The vehicle was boring at first as well, but it quickly started to come together. It looked pretty monstrous at the end, and really seems almost like a monster truck. The vehicle is just the right size for playability, my hand wraps perfectly around the width of the vehicle. I was also amused by the chicken wing being used as bait. However, the play feature where the string&nbsp;catches&nbsp;the raptor rarely works, which is why this set does not&nbsp;receive&nbsp;a 5 on playability.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I am still happy about&nbsp;receiving this set.

You start with the little base station thing then move on to the truck.&nbsp;The truck looks really ugly for most of the build, as encased inside it are some blue and white pieces that throw the whole color scheme off for a while.&nbsp;And I subtract half a point for the little stickers you have to put on the 1x2 control panels by the crane.&nbsp;<b>3/5</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigs:</b>&nbsp;Assuming you don't count the raptor as a fig, these are very disappointing. The guy with the brown hat has a crimson shirt, which looks yucky next to the two shades of brown and the dark tan also prominently displayed on the fig. There's also a little too much of his neck showing, and I think the little barbed wire ""D"" logo on the back and breast of his shirt is corny. His face is bad too, his eyes are really close together and his mouth is tiny. He looks like he's about eight.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The cowboy hat guy is no better. Although the dark tan hat is nice, and so are the pants with the holster, his shirt is really weird. It looks like he's wearing a leather vest tied up over his stomach with shoelaces over a weird dark tan shirt that, like the other guy, exposes a ton of neck. His face is the worst part, though. I can't even describe it, I just don't know what lego was thinking. Orange muttonchops? Blegh. The only cool part about either of these fig is the pewter tranquilizer gun that cowboy guy has. <b>1/5</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Parts: </b>In this area, the set is very competent. There are some very cool parts. The raptor, of course, is totally new and fantastic, much better than the rubbery old Dino Attack dinos. Only problem is that &nbsp;when his mouth clicks open it opens really wide, and it looks pretty bad. Other notable pieces include three light green syringes (I think they're supposed to be tranquilizer darts,) six nice spikes, a printed control panel, the chicken wing, and two ten-stud strings with studs at either end. <b>4/5</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Features: </b>The set doesn't have very many action things it can do; the crane rotates and moves up and down very nicely, that is to say it doesn't slip, and the black grates can either be ladders up to the cockpit or protective barriers. There's a couple of flick-fire missiles, purely standard issue, and the base thing is on a hinge. The weirdest feature for me is the rope end of the crane. The raptor chases after the chicken and gets it's head through the loop, but then what? The crane lifts up, letting the raptor dangle there by the neck? That's pretty grisly for a set with a 5-12 age range. <b>4/5</b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Atmosphere: </b>The atmosphere is pretty fun, I suppose. I like the bright yellow of the truck, and the jungle pieces on the little base thing. The minifigs, though, are a bit too happy, so you couldn't really have a thrilling dino chase, they obviously aren't scared in the slightest at the prospect of hunting down a raptor. It almost makes the raptor less terrifying, which is disappointing, because he's really the best part of the set. <b>2/5</b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall: </b>This set was kind of a disaster. The minifigs are awful, the atmosphere is kinda cheesy, and the concept is flawed in some ways. <b>14/25 </b>or <b>56%. </b>That's an F- at my school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,5,4,4,4

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-06-06T19:16:15.837Z","What do you mean, it's NOT Jurassic Park?","<p>Since I haven&#39;t written any reviews since March and Jurassic World is getting lots of coverage, I thought I would review an older Dino set eerily similar to this year&#39;s Dilophosaurus Ambush. This is the only LEGO dinosaur I&#39;ve got, and the set looks fantastic: monster truck, Utahraptor, over-the-top design vibe... what&#39;s not to love?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>These were thrown out in a move some time ago. The box was quite large and yellow, as I recall... the instructions move very slowly. :/</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of yellow and miscellaneous stuff that&#39;s cool, but not terribly useful... and one olive green raptor. He&#39;s oversized, poseable, detailed, and armed to the teeth. You can stick a minifigure on his back for some crazy photography if you so wished... as it is with all the dinos except the Coelophysis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get two figures, a veteran dino tracker and a driver. Contrary to all official artwork, I only recieved one awesome tranquilizer gun. Both are obviously part of the same group, and look a bit like they&#39;d be right at home in the apocalypse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are less than 300 pieces in this set. It doesn&#39;t take terribly long to complete. Not very interesting, either, but this a set made to be played with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The truck is very large for a 200-piece model. Of course, this is deceptive... it&#39;s not made entirely out of cheese slopes, and the base beneath that rugged bodywork is not at all large. There&#39;s a small base thing, but that&#39;s parts fodder really. Anyway, back to the truck: There&#39;s a reasonably large cockpit in the middle that is simultaneously open and well-armored, and feels quite Spartan. Then again, this is the dino apocalypse... To fight off that big pesky lizard we get a great big honking... what? Chicken leg? Upon closer examination, there&#39;s a noose to strangle that raptor. This doesn&#39;t work terribly well, and neither do the missiles, but running it over is definitely enough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set. Sure, part of it is pure parts fodder, the play features don&#39;t work, and it could really use one more figure... but the truck is very large, very swooshable, and certainly looks the part of a lean, mean, dino-hunting machine. Recommended to lovers of dinosaurs, monster trucks, and awesomeness.</p>
