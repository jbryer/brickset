"JBH75","2011-11-22T21:32:27.56Z","The Pterandon has returned with a vengeance!","Boy it has been a while since the last time I reviewed a set huh? Well, since the new Lego Dino stuff had been released in my area, I went to the Lego Store (at sherway) to check out the selection, and this was the cheapest Dino set they had, so I got it ($24.99 CDN), though I planned to get it anyway. I had always been a fan of the lego dinos since the Adventures. Even when Dino Attack (Dino 2010) kind off messed around with it too much. Enough about nostalgia, let's jump into this set. Let's break this down.<div><br></div><div>The set includes: 1 minifigure, various accessories, 1 dinosaur, a tower with a dock, and a small boat of sorts. The color scheme for this set features some nice colors such as yellow and dark red for most of the tower, which work well together. Fairly straight forward, but there is depth to this set despite it's simplicity. Dive in:</div><div><br></div><h4>The Minifigure:</h4><div><ul><li>This figure has a new printed, doubled-sided torso, and a head I haven't seen before so I'm assuming it's new.&nbsp;</li><li>The legs do not have printing</li><li>The headgear is a brown pilot's helmet with goggles</li></ul>Overall, a welcome addition to the minifigure line-up, but having leg printing would've been nice.</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories/Equipment (whatever you want to call it):</h4><div><ul><li>The new weapon of choice in this theme, which is a dark grey coloured rifle, with a clip on it for the attachment of tranquilizer serum (light green syrettes), or a scope if want to get creative.&nbsp;</li><li>A walkie-talkie (can never have too many of those)</li><li>An extra green syrette (or syringe if you prefer)</li><li>A fish, in a metallic shade of grey, rather than the dull grey color seen in the 2009 pirates theme.&nbsp;</li></ul>A decent amount of accessories were put into this set. The only complaint I have is that the clip on the gun is fixed to the top. It would be nice to be&nbsp;detachable for use in MOCs, but i guess that would be a little too convenient.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Dinosaur (what we all came to read about):</h4><div><ul><li>Lego's molding for the pteranodon in this set has been greatly updated from the more ""realistic (non mutated)"" one from 2001, and looks much better than the mutant one from dino attack. It looks realistic, but cartoony, like Lego should.</li><li>It has even been given studs on top to have things placed on top of it (Dinoriders anyone?)</li><li>The coloration of brown and dark red striping is unique to this set, and actually gives a really nice look</li><li>Like it's previous design, the wings move up and down amazingly and are attached to the main body by clipped pieces, and the head is attached so the jaw and open and close.&nbsp;</li><li>Unlike it's previous design however, it's feet can be used to hold objects like rods</li><li>As an additional note, the dino's head is packaged up in plastic to prevent it from scratching or bending, so congrats to Lego for thinking of that</li></ul>Overall, this new pteranodon is amazing. The only complaint I have with it, is that the box makes it look huge, when in fact, it's an average size dino. Nonetheless, worth it.</div><div><br></div><h4><b>And now for the building and the little boat:</b></h4><div><b>Boat:<br></b><ul><li>Honestly, the little boat looks as though it was made of spare parts. It doesn't even have a propeller on it. It fulfills it's purpose though, or can be used to make additions to the tower. Just don't buy the set for the boat.</li></ul><b>Tower:</b>&nbsp;<br><ul><li>This tower has a very simple build, so it's pretty KFOL friendly.</li><li>This tower has an observation deck for tracking the pteranodon (with a crude-built satellite dish) with a printed on computer piece, which appears built in rock with leafy greens on it. The fish is used as bait here.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>The tower has a ladder which leads to a docking area for the boat, and has a small storage unit for extra syrettes, the gun, walk-talkie, anything really.&nbsp;</li><li>On the top of the tower is a well designed net-launcher to capture the pteranodon, and I must say, it works really well</li><li>There are also some new (to me) yellow framework pieces holding the tower up, a must for construction builders.</li></ul>Overall, the tower is fairly good. It's little compact, and the satellite dish is too plain, but it works very well for a set like this.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion though this set does give me some reasons to complain (though i'm probably nitpicking), this set is outstanding. It delivers what it promises, is a good easy build, and was a great way to start off a collection for the new Dino Lego. I strongly recommend getting this set, even if you are going to get it just for the pteranodon (which for now is unique to this set). It is filled with great parts, no stickers, and offers a lot of playability. The price is reasonable, but could stand to be a few dollars cheaper, as you will most likely be buying these sets for the Dinosaurs. Now I'm just rambling on, go try this one out for yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading. -SB7538</div><div><br></div><div>(If anyone can tell me how to properly put images on a review, I'd really appreciate it. The URL stuff is confusing me. Send me an email or notification, but identify yourself first)</div><div>&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Squidtron","2012-02-16T00:17:57.22Z","Better than one would guess from the box.","<h4>Build <br></h4>The build on this set is pretty simple, brick-on-brick build. It's easy, quick, but the completed model is effective.<br><br><h4>Minifigures <br></h4>I was impressed by the pteranodon on this set. It is surprisingly accurate; it is well-shaped, has realistic proportions, and in fact is even minifig-scale. Overall, it is fun to look at, and definitely superior to the previous two pteranodon models. Compared to the original, Dino Island model, this one is more streamlined and a good deal larger. Also, the Dino Island model is one solid Lego brick whereas the new form is made up of five different pieces: A main body piece, a lower jaw, an upper jaw, and two wings. It can flap its wings and open or close its mouth. The Dino Attack model of pteranodon was too large and not realistic. Even though it was made of more pieces, I enjoy the pose-ability of the new pteranodon more because it can flap its wings. <br>The minifigure included is also cool, his face has a serious , kind of grumpy or stressed expression with something new I have not seen on a Lego minifigure before: sweat. His helmet is a standard helmet, nothing to special about it, but useful in MOCing. The torso is great, it is double-sided and really gives a powerful, militaristic feel. Both sides of his shirt have a large ""D"" printed on them, presumably standing for ""Dino"". His legs are unprinted, and the colours on them are cool looking but not useful for MOCing. <br><h4>Completed Model <br></h4>The tower is nice, though I feel like it could have used an extra level. It looks pretty good from the front, especially the rock wall and the leaves, but the back does not look so solid; there is nothing to cover up the lower section of the tower. Other than that, I like the model quite a bit. I especially liked the inclusion of water, via blue baseplates, beneath the little dock. The boat isn't great, it seems a little like its missing a back half.<br><h4>Playability <br></h4>The net launcher was a pleasant surprise for me on this one. It works well and it's pretty fun to try catching the pteranodon, even though it takes a lot of practice to actually hit it. There really isn't much playability other than that.<br><h4>Parts&nbsp;</h4>The parts in this set are mostly blocky, structural pieces. However, a couple stood out as nice pieces. The pieces of the pteranodon are well made in particular, but not really useful outside of their original purpose. One could use its lower jaw as a spike though, and the main body piece makes a passing rubber chicken. The fish is a new piece to me, though it has been used in previous sets, and I like it. The leaf pieces are also new to me, though, like the fish, they have been around for a while. The one piece I really like is the tranquilizer gun. It is made up of two pieces, a dark-silver gun with a clip to attach a neon-green syringe. Both of these are well made parts, but the gun is more useful in my opinion. You can attack other items besides a syringe in the clip, for instance, one can attach a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=64644"">telescope piece</a> and make a snipe rifle, but the coolest looking gun that can be made is made by attaching a second tranquilizer gun upside-down on top of the first so that they both clip on to each other.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"AETerry","2012-04-02T17:55:36.64Z","Tower Takedown Review","<p>I just now picked up the second of my Dino Theme sets and I must say that I really like this one with the Tower, the computer operations room, dock and jet ski. It does feel a bit over priced at $19.99 overall for the set, but still worth it I think.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is of course, cardboard and features a clear image of the set you're getting and does a lot to hype up this set, getting your attention, especially with the Pteranodon and the paramilitary guy who's either studying the dinosaurs or trying to capture them.</p><p>The instructions are in booklet form and create a deceptive illusion that this will somehow be bigger than it really is. It does follow LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations and has a parts list at the end of them followed by some pictures of other sets in the Dino Theme.<br></p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>At 136 pieces for a $19.99 set, it does feel price wise that this set is overpriced by about $5. But taking in the specialty piece(s) of the Pteranodon and some of the larger ""wall"" pieces, it evens out. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>While the set is listed as having one minifigure, the presence of the Pteranodon has me wanting to count it as having two.</p><p>The main and real minifigure is the Paramilitary Guy who's based at the tower studying and trying to capture dinosaurs. He's got a faded evergreen color to his uniform he's wearing and a helmet with goggles. He's not bad and I do like him. I also like the expression and the sweat drops on his face as he seems nervous about dealing with the Pteranodon.</p><p>The other figure that I count in this set is the Pteranodon, the flying dinosaur that features in this set and one of the main draws to the excitement of the new Dino Theme. This piece is very well detailed and has come a long ways since the Dino Attack (Dino 2010) and Adventurers themes of several years ago, making some of those dinosaurs look clunky and primitive in comparison.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build is surprisingly simple and a quick. It's also built mainly in three stages.</p><p>The first build is for the Jet Ski that's docked next to the tower. I'd have done something different for the back and the motor as it seems to flat and abrupt on the end where the front is articulated well with the choice of pieces used.</p><p>The second build is the Tower. The tower, with the net flying out makes me think of the net tower out of the first Batman Batcave set. But I do like it's simplicity and efforts to look like it blends in with natural surroundings with the use of rocks and palm leaves. Other small features on it are a stationary satellite dish and a pole sticking out with a fish on it as bait for the net to try and capture the Pteranodon.</p><p>The third build and attaches to the Tower when done is the docks where the Jet Ski sits at. This too is simple, yet does the job effectively with out going overboard.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While I love the Dino Attack (Dino 2010) theme, that theme featured a lot of vehicles and didn't have any bases of operations as the Dino Theme shows like with the Tower Takedown. I don't particularly like the color theme of yellow and brick red that this Theme has, but I do love all the new Dinosaurs and the paramilitary guys that come with many of the sets.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"JurassicaProductions","2012-05-29T10:38:28.81Z","Review","This is my second Lego Dino set. I love the fact that it comes with a pterosaur(which, contrary to popular belief, is NOT a dinosaur) and a jet ski. It comes with a minifig as well as a fish(""bait for the pterosaur'). The tower/dock was easy to put together and did not take long to do so. It has excellent playability and is a great gift for any Lego fans out there.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

Additionally the figure includes a binocular and helmet hair piece and a fairly large inoculation gun. This figure on,y has one facial expression.</div><div><br></div><div>The Raptor is also included in this set, which I'm classing &nbsp;as a large figure in the set. The figure is made of three large pieces where the wings attach to the main body. The raptor contains a fair amount of detail such as textured patterns on the wings. The beak opens and closes and the wings can also be changed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Elements of the set</b></div><div>The main elements of the set are a medium sized patrol tower and small jet boat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The small boat included is built from a small number of pieces &nbsp;giving off the appearance of a small escape boat. There aren't many specific features of the small boat except full curved piece at the back plus the front handle which can't rotate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The tower itself is quite small and made up of three base plates, two small blue rectangular ones and a square brown one. The structure is built on two levels with the lower comprising a small dock with a safety barrier on one side and small stairs on the other. There's also a small equipment rack between both sections too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the lower section of the tower, a brown boulder piece is being used as a wall along with the two yellow structure pieces. There is nothing striking located within the inside of the lower level of the tower and this cannot be accessed by the small dock.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The upper level of the tower is made of one yellow structure piece as well as two tall 1x1 pieces which support the roof of the set. There isn't much in the upper tower which is already quite small in size except a glass panel piece and a screen piece at the top which is where the figure is presumably tracking the dinosaur. Other features include the large leaf pieces at the side of the tower and a fish pole as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The roof of the tower includes a net shooter which can rotate and be fired on the raptor figure. Additional features include the four round 1x1's on the roof and the lights on the side of the shooter also accompanied by sharp spike pieces too to make it look slightly more impressive.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div>Overall, this isn't a bad set, it's certainly not a terrible but it definitely isn't a brilliant one. The set is rather small and a bit on the pricey side for £18 and would be more suited to a £15 price point as well as there not being too much striking by the design and the generic appearance of the set.</div><div><br></div><div>However this set is won over by its usage of unique parts such as those used for the raptor and the bright yellow support pieces in the set plus the fairly high playability with all the features such as the net shooter and different areas of the tower and the boat which can extend playability further.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would recommend this set to kids who enjoy action role play, dinosaur lovers and those who like Lego structures.

"123MrBrick","2015-06-21T04:17:52.46Z","Low-graded Dino Set.","<p>It&#39;s okay. There&#39;s not much playability.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box of the era. Front shows action, back shows features. Instructions had no errors. One manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set did come with some yellow &#39;structure&#39; pieces, as well as some palm fronds. You can never have too many fish. The Pterodactyl mold has only appeared in three sets thus far.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two figures, <strong>Pilot </strong>(named so for simplicity) and <strong>the Pterodactyl.</strong> Pilot features a standard amount of printing for a Dino figure. His tranquilizer gun is pretty cool. The Pterodactyl has an articulated jaw and flapping wings. His feet can grip to poles and other objects.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a pretty simple process. You really just build up a square and add a dock and boat.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like the tower. It&#39;s a cool add on for the larger base set. There is not much detail inside, but I have a soft spot for bases and fortresses. The net launcher works fine.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is fun. It&#39;s a little boring, which is why I&#39;m glad I have 3 other Dino sets and a Jurassic World set to complement it. It is still worth getting for a decent price, however.</p>
