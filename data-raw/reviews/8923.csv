<p>The&nbsp;first small set in the series, <em><strong>Ambush Attack,</strong></em> has a good starting point with a nicely designed four-wheeler, an all new Lego weapon/rifle and the star of the set a <strong>Coelophysis</strong>! Pronounced...SEE-loh-FIE-sis, which means 'Hollow Form' (or hollow structure...something like that).</p>
<p>At 80+ pieces retailing for $9.99, Ambush Attack is an easy build, comes with one mini-fig, new Lego rifle weapon with attached clip, brush/foliage diorama, nicely designed 4-wheeler and a new dinosaur to the Lego line, a Coelophysis.</p>
<p>The dinosaur, vehicle and ease of build will appeal to the young builder while the parts in this set would be great for Moc builders out there. The break down below...</p>

<h4>Parts...</h4>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5604.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: The syringes from the Collectable MiniFigures line in flourescent green (nice to use for your Mad Scientist to re-animate the dead!)Here though, the syringes are meant to be tranquilizer darts.</em></p>
<p><em>Love the new rifle with top clip. Great for customizing (I'm thinkin' of this element and mod-it for Boba Fett).</em></p>
<p><em>Also, new round 1x1 trans red tile.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Vehicle...</h4>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5621.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: The 4-Wheeler has a spearing weapon, side mounted flick-fire missiles (again meant to be tranquilizers) and the hood piece's graphics are printed.</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5627.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: The side vents can tilt all the way up and act as a shield for the driver in case the dino's chompers get too close for comfort.</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5626.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: Rear of the vehicle has a clip to hold the rifle or tool, etc.</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dinosaur...</h4>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/dinosaur-images-036-resize.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: The Coelophysis is a solid figure, one whole piece that's made of a softer/rubbery plastic. Lego captured somewhat of the stripping designs on the creature but I feel it looks a bit too bulky/heavy. But I suspect it's made that way to stand up to play and not be damaged easily. </em></p>
<p><em>Also of note...the hands and mouth of the Coelophysis can hold a bar/rod sized Lego element like the rifle and the stem of the flick-fire missile, etc.</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Foliage...</h4>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5618.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><em>Note: Love the large fan pieces and here is a good opportunity for the young builders to expand the brush and build a bigger scene. This foliage diorama is meant to hide the dino behind before attacking his prey.</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mini-Figure...</h4>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN5628.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><em>Note: Figure&nbsp;is duel-faced(with scar/bruise) and the torso has nice printing front and back (good for those customizing their army/combat figures).</em></p>

<h4>Summary...</h4>
<p><strong><em>DINO Ambush Attack</em></strong> is a nice small kit and start of what could be a popular line.</p>
<p>Has a 'Jurassic Park-esque' story-theme happening (don't know for sure though), some new&nbsp;elements for the Moc'ers out there, overall easy builds for younger builders and of course...dinosaurs!</p>
<p><em>Parents...these can&nbsp;be great kits for your kids. While it's a toy, you can get involved and have them research the different dinosaurs and perhaps they can include them in their school reports and projects.</em></p>

"AETerry","2011-11-18T19:27:27.573Z","Ambush Attack Review","I feel it's quite the pleasant surprise to get one of the 2012 sets before the year is even here yet. The 2012 Dino series is certainly a reprise and revisit to the 2005 Dino Attack and 2010 Dino themes as well as the Adventurers' Dino Island themes.<br><br>I picked this set up at $11.99, nearly 3x the price of the 2005 Dino Attack set <a title=""View full details of set 7473: Steel Sprinter vs. Mutant Lizard"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7473-1"">7473</a> <strong><a title=""View full details of set 7473: Steel Sprinter vs. Mutant Lizard"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7473-1"">Steel Sprinter vs. Mutant Lizard</a><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and easily double the piece count 80 pieces versus 42 pieces. The two sets are very comparable and they show an evolution to the complexity for LEGO models and designs. While there are many of the same elements and design, there's more of an involved build. Extending out the piece count and build for this set is the small plate holding a lot of foliage pieces to suggest a Jungle setting.<br><br>Color wise for the car, the use of yellow with a dark red conveys a safari type feel and reminds me of the second Jurassic Park movie: The Lost World and all those big game hunters driving around in their vehicles hunting dinosaurs.<br><br>Where Dino Attack featured a story of giant mutant lizards and creatures resembling dinosaurs, the 2012 Dino theme is going for far more realism with modeling the dinos off of known fossils and dinosaurs. New for me is the name: </span></strong>Coelophysis. It would have been far easier for me to assumed and called it a velociraptor from the Jurassic Park movies &amp; books.<br><br>While I like the <strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></strong>Coelophysis for its realism and the stripping, I'd have preferred if LEGO could have made this solid figure more slimmer like the Mutant Lizards are from Dino Attack and not too bulky. And that's more at the feel level of this figure where it seems bulky.<br><br>As seems to have become LEGO's standard, there are plenty of extra little pieces in this set. There's also new pieces in the way of the red tail light piece that's a 1x1 round tile and not a 1x1 round plate piece that's transparent. The rifle model is new, allowing for the green syringe, suggesting it's a tranquilizer rifle. For those of us who collected up the Nurse minifigure from Series 1, there's now an opportunity to get more syringe accessories.<br><br>All in all, I'm very pleased with this set and look forward to trying to pick up the rest of the theme as the 2012 year finally arrives and progresses.<br><h4><strong></strong></h4>

"Firox_5000","2012-02-14T16:25:00.563Z","Ambush Swarm ","<p>I purchased this small dinosaur set at my local Argos store. The model which contains 80 pieces took me aproximately 10 minutes to build and the construction process prooving to be very straight forward. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The finished set features an ordinary but still cool looking dino hunter equipped with a gun fitted with a dino tranquiliser. The other figure in the set is a small dino who in the box is packaged in plastic keeping it protected. The overall figure is interesting but yet at the same time lacking something to make it anything special. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main structure of the set is a small four wheeled jeep which is equiped with flick fire missles and armour plates on the sides. The jeep is perhaps my favourite part of the set due to it's sturdyness and compact look. The set also includes a bush shrub which although is nothing terrifically special provides great playability for the dino and hunter to sneak around. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall playability of this set is very good for a small set in which the figures,vehicle and shrub add plenty of possibilities. My only complaints about the set is the dino is lacking in someway and the price at £8.99 is perhaps just a tiny bit overpriced and I would have preffered it to be £7.99.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a summary of this review, I would recommend the set if you like dinosaurs, sets with playability or you are interested in the parts.&nbsp;I&nbsp;recommend this set to&nbsp;all dino lovers.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"Bram","2012-03-23T02:14:14.833Z","A gem in the Dino line-up..an instant vignette too.","This is my second Dino set, having bought the other end of the scale, the 5886.<br>The assembly of this was as quick as a blink of an eye, nothing extraordinary, so let's move on to the post build impression! I'll give individual score for each attributes of this set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifig</span>: Ah..dual printed face, a smiling one, and a scared 'sh**less' one. He's got a sleeveless t-shirts prints, in the usual dark red Dino 'company' scheme, with the 'D' logo on his left chest...so I guess he works there, and this is the company's uniform LOL. The legs are dark tan color. The front is highly detailed with a waist belt, and a shoulder belt carrying the complimentary dinosaur 'sleeping drugs'. The back comes with a huge 'D' logo and straps, with a small pouch on the left waist..probably to store his i-Phone to order parts from Bricklink when he's missing a limb hahahaha...anyway this minifig is very detailed, and it's nice to see such effort by the Lego design team. He carries the standard tranquilizer riffle with the yellowish green syringe dart. The only missing part is the goggle, since he's wearing an aviator helmet, would be nice for Lego to throw in this part. Thankfully I have a bunch of spare goggles. Score 9/10<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bad guy</span>: This set comes with a Coleophysis..I don't if I spelled it correctly.What the heck is it??? We grew up with T-rex's, Spinosaurus,Raptor, I wonder if kids are familiar with this. A thorough research on the web reveals it as a small dinosaur..conveniently carnivorous in nature! The last thing we want is a veggies dino..LOL. The model is sadly a one piece mold, so the arms and legs aren't poseable. The prints are nice though, an the eyes somehow have that devious look. However what's striking is how much it resembles a Raptor..So I always tell myself this is a raptor LOL..much cooler.<br>Despite the single piece mold shortcoming, I think Lego named it as Coleophysis was to give one unfamiliar dinosaur so kids are more enthusiastic to do a 'research', get them off that videogames and educate themselves. Nice effort Lego. Score : 8.5/10<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Buggy</span> : This is actually the 'completed' buggy as opposed to the slightly knocked off version of the one in the 5886. At a glance it looks like a modified golf kart Mad Max would drive LOL...The buggy is very compact, carrying twin flickfire tranquilizer darts (I wouldn't call it a missile). The design is very simple yet effective with the foldable side guards, a clip on the rear to store the riffle and a nice 1x1 round tiles for the taillight.<br>The rear 'engine' compartment&nbsp; has strange trans orange grooved tile and a 1x1 dial printed tile. I can make out exactly what these are..a fuel gauge? The trans orange is probably to simulate a glowing hot air cooled engine's fins...make sense since these dinos are enclosed in a hell-ish tropical environment LOL. The small barbs on the fontend can be replaced with a more functional headlights. <br><br>I like the design a lot.Score 9/10<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Accessories</span>: You get this nice foliage for the Coleo..I mean 'raptor' to hide before striking our minifig friend here. Actually this set alone with an added base is an instant vignette and tells pretty much 'a story'! Score 9/10<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span>: Little gem in the Dino lineup, get it.<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

The details, the minifig, the dino, even the plant! All amazing. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>The minfig. His torso is really cool and looks more like bullets being strapped across his chest, not tranquilizer liquid. </li><li>The gun. Perfect to modify into a sniper rifle. </li><li>The syringe piece! You get an extra too in case your ""Hero"" misses and needs extra tranquilizer. FINALLY I&nbsp;get my hands on these pieces! </li><li>The dino. Despite being rubbery and having only one stud, the dino hits the mark and looks fierce......some. (Haha, see what I did there? :P) </li><li>The vehicle. Lots of detail and play value. </li><li>(Also, it doesn't necessarily say this on the box, but if your imaginative enough, you can ""CONVERT"" the vehicle into an attack mode. Just lift the flick missiles up and then lift the sides up to become shields.)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong></p><ul><li>The front of the vehicle. The ""ramming"" feature makes it look very ugly. </li><li>The plant. Nice detail, but kinda unecessary. Then again, I finally have those big&nbsp;plant pieces! </li><li>The dino is made of rubber. And has one stud. Must I say more? </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall an AWESOME set! This set is strong in the Play Value and will never turn to the Boring Side.

"123MrBrick","2012-03-11T13:30:25.83Z","ROAR!","<p>For the smallest of the Dino sets currently available, it's worth the money!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box showed all of the features of the set, and the instructions were easy to follow,&nbsp;and when sets are small like this, they are usually easier to build than others.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The rifle&nbsp;is brand-new, and the syringe hasn't been seen for two years. This set also featured one of the new round 1x1 tiles, in transperent red. Another thing: the green leaf and the dark tan leaf were a first for me. The gauge tile and the trans-orange grille were rare to me as well.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set came with two minifigs, if you consider a dinosaur a minifig! The driver had a basic helmet,a face that could switch between determined or scared, a body with plenty of printing, and both sides had a large 'D' which obviously stood for 'Dino', and dark-tan legs, but no printing here. The dino featured a hole in between its teeth, big enough to fit the rifle included in the set into its mouth. The dino also had a single stud on the back for minifigs to ride on, although it could have been more posable like the larger dinosaurs in the theme.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I built this set in under ten minutes, and it was fun to build step after step.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed jeep and driver could have been a set by itself, but the foliage makes it better, and of course, it wouldn't be a Dino set without the dinosaur. The gray 1x2 sloped grilles on the sides can be flipped up, and with the trans-orange parts underneath them, it looks like they are engines to help the car fly. The back has a clip for storing the rifle or any other equipment.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>5/5 stars. AWESOME.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-22T12:08:46.977Z","LEGO Dinosaurs Return","<p>Set #5882 Ambush Attack: LEGO brings back a child favorite from the past, with brand new pieces that look much improved from the old Adventurers Dinosaur Theme, and some great fun ideas.</p>
<p>The Ambush Attack set is the smallest of the Dino Theme, priced at 14.99$ in Canada, the same price as a Battle Pack, you might think that the price is higher than normal and not worth it. You would be wrong, the new dinosaur piece included in the set, in my opinion, justifies the higher than average price. (Also if you're savvy enough you can shop smart and grab this set on sale.)</p>
<p>Two models use up most of the 80 pieces included in the set, a small jungle scene piece and a 4x4 Dino Hero vehicle in yellow and gray primary colors. The Jungle Scenery model is fairly standard, it does however include some nice color choices, with a small tan 4x4 baseplate, some brown slopes and a medium beige/tan colored 'Frond' piece found in most LEGO Trees. Plus the standard green colored variant. It's designed for a chameleon effect for the dinosaur who is a dark tan/beige color with green markings.</p>
<p>The Dino Hero vehicle is mostly yellow, it's a small all-terrain style vehicle capable of traversing the rugged jungle setting of the prehistoric lost world that has been discovered in the LEGO Universe. Perhaps the same island Johnny Thunder visted in the late 90s. It's a fun little vehicle, not too difficult to build and uses a few clever steps with black lightsaber blade pieces to make the small attached ladders for the Dino Hero to climb up and down from the driver's compartment. It also features a nice printed yellow piece with maroon colored markings and a printed 1x1 tile which we've seen before in Power Miners if I'm not mistaken. You also get two flick-fire missiles and one of the new 1x1 studs which are smooth in red.</p>
<p>The Dino Hero, as he is known, this was before LEGO started giving everybody names is a neat looking Mini-Fig. He's got a great dark maroon colored torso with excellent double-sided print featuring the Dino Theme's logo of a big yellow/green D on his chest and back. A belt and bandolier holding tranquilizer cartridges to use on the Dinosaur. And a pouch on his back completes the accessories in printed form. He's wearing&nbsp;a visorless head gear in brown, fortunately LEGO supplies so many extra visors in sets that feature them you can easily add one to your liking if you'd prefer. His legs are a nice light brown color I don't think we've seen very often from LEGO. And he has a double-sided head with two different expressions, happy or scared. (I especially like the red scratches on one cheek, as if he's been in some kind of recent scuffle.)</p>
<p>Accessory wise you get a new tranq gun with the needles first seen in Series 1 CMF, this time in a bright lime green color. (You get two of the needles.) The Dinosaur is not a Velociraptor, I first thought it might be, however it's actually meant to be a species called Coeleophysis. The Dino piece is just all-around impressive and this is the cheapest set to feature this particular piece. It's actually a soft style plastic, not hard like typical LEGO Abs, it can even bend a bit, though I caution the young children not to be too rough with it in case you might permanently get it stuck with his head facing the wrong way. You have one stud on its back, so you can attach LEGO Elements, build your own Dino Riders perhaps. It also has one locking foot that can attach to studs.</p>
<p>Overall I am quite impressed with this new Theme from LEGO and sad to see it go so quickly, it seems as if it was barely around and many of the sets are now hard to come by at the end of the year. I definitely reccomend this set, it has a lot of play value, the pieces are great and the new dino piece with all it's printed detailing are a great improvement from LEGO. They've been making a lot more detailed animals of late, that go well together, the Tauntaun, Camel, Ostrich and Horse pieces all look great. These animals are fun to collect and display.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

I put it together in about 5 minutes, it was easy to build and has excellent playability. The only problem I have is with the dinosaur (which i believe to be a Coelophysis). The legs don't move and neither does the mouth; its just one of those pieces that just sit there. Overall though, it is an extremely fun set. ;)",FALSE,4,5,5,5,4

<p>For te Figure we have a normal Dinosaur hunter, With a solid Torso and Head print. There&#39;s some plain Legs and a standard Helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s just 1 small rubbery piece but i think it looks great for it&#39;s size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the parts there&#39;s some good stuff here. Plants, Pistol, Wheels, some useful stuff here.</p>

<p>Building the set was a quick and enjoyable experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plant is nothing special, You can imagine the Dinosaur hiding behind it? Or eating the plants?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is Pretty nice with some Missiles, i like the Yellow colour scheme, A clip to hold the Weapon on the back which is good because as a kid i would always lose my Minifig weapons so having a place to store it is nice. The Yellow wheels match good too, Overall it&#39;s just good!&nbsp;</p>
