</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>This is one of the brick boxes that comes with a nice reusable plastic storage case, in this case in Pink.&nbsp; As with all of the brick boxes, this one has plenty of empty space to store additional sets or bricks.<br><br>One interesting thing about the instructions is that it has LEGO Friends on the back cover, so this clearly is intended as an introduction that will lead a child into the LEGO Friends line, or as a supplement to the LEGO friends line.<br><h4>Parts</h4>The earlier Pink Brick Boxes included a good mix of standard colors (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green) along with some of the rarer colors (Orange, Pink, Purple, etc.).&nbsp; Since the rarer colors were the main attraction of the set, the inclusion of the more common colors generally was negatively received by many.&nbsp; This set addresses those complaints quite well.<br><br>In this set, you won't any red, blue, yellow, green, black, or white standard bricks.&nbsp; Some of those colors are completely absent, while others are used very sparingly to provide interesting parts like slopes, plates, arches, etc.<br><br>What you will mainly find is lots of Orange, Pink, Dark Pink, Purple and accents of Lavender, Magenta, and Lime.&nbsp; This set is just filled with interesting and rare colors!<br><br>As far as interesting parts, it has one croissant, a plate, and a dark pink cup.&nbsp; Strangely, while it has two of the arched windows, it doesn't include panes for those windows.<br><br>However, as an added bonus, the set also includes one of the new orange brick separator tools!<br><h4>Minifigures</h4>Unlike the previous small Pink Brick Box, this set does include a minifig, and a unique minifig at that.&nbsp; She is wearing a purple shirt with flowers, and is a welcome addition to the male dominated LEGO City.<br><br>It is however interesting to note that this set includes a standard minifig, when the instruction manual has tie ins to LEGO Friends.&nbsp; Personally I don't mind since a new female minifig torso is always great, but it is something to note for those who are looking for extra bricks to add to their LEGO friends collection.<br><h4>The build</h4>There are instructions to build a few basic models, a house, car, dog, table, and a few trees/shrubs.&nbsp; Nothing terribly exciting, but enough to subtly introduce a child to basic building techniques.<h4>The completed model</h4>Again, the completed model isn't terribly exciting, but I think it's enough to satisfy a young child who has outgrown Duplo and is new to LEGO.<h4>Summary</h4>This is a set that is easy to overlook if you purchased the predecessor, since the box looks almost the same sitting on the shelf in the store.&nbsp; If you bought the previous set and weren't terribly impressed, give this set a second look because you might be surprised.&nbsp; It eliminates the common colors almost completely, gives us eight more pieces, includes a minifig and a brick separator, plus tons of parts in rare colors.&nbsp; All of this for the same price.&nbsp; LEGO, you've outdone yourself on this one, great job!<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
