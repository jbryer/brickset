"T79","2014-04-28T09:27:49.493Z","Time to fix that cow!","<p>One of the first &#39;recent&#39; lego sets we received, so without further ado here&#39;s a review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a tub, a convenient way to store the set and with enough space inside to add several other sets (in our case, e.g.&nbsp;#5575 Basic Bricks which they had received earlier but was still stored in the&nbsp;original box). Once the collection grows beyond what can fit in we&#39;ll see what can still be done with it but for now it&#39;s certainly better for storing those lego bricks than a cardboard box.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and it&#39;s nice to have additional instructions available on the website (at least, there were, I can&#39;t seem to find them at the moment) but given the popularity of the race car alternative to the tractor with my children it would have been better were they included in printed form already.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Again a nice variety of basic parts and colours, and it includes a brick separator so no more separating bricks with nails and teeth (often to the detriment of both and the bricks themselves)! Of course another set of wheels to make two vehicles at the same time is always better when there are two kids trying to play at once, but then again they&#39;d probably go for the same car anyway.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There&#39;s just one, a farmer with green coveralls and a&nbsp;baseball cap of a new model which seems to fit on the head a lot looser than I remember the old model did (but I could&nbsp;be mistaken). He comes with a wrench to fix the tractor which gets applied with the same zeal to the cow. A few more &#39;farming&#39; accessories like a shovel or a pitchfork might have been nice, still it&#39;s a nice indication that farming involves a lot more mechanization nowadays.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy enough for small children, especially the house/barn which actually reminds me of some of those basic sets I had when I was three or four. The cow is a favourite and the farmer often foregoes the comfy tractor to take a ride on his bovine. As mentioned earlier the race car is liked better than the tractor but that&#39;s probably just the age.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All very basic stuff but that has a charm of it&#39;s own and it certainly allows young children to build it themselves with just a bit of help. And there&#39;s no loss taking things apart and making something else.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is sort of an updated version of the &#39;basic&#39; boxes I had as a child&nbsp;(like #355-2 Universal Building&nbsp;Set&nbsp;for example) but with an actual minifig instead of those finger puppets :).</p>

<p>I remember having fun with these sets back then,&nbsp;and this iteration still pleases the next generation so for making the transition from duplo to lego this is an ideal candidate!</p>

It holds so much nostalgia! It has so many good pieces for a basic set! The price is [was &#39;cause inflation!] nice for the pieces you get. This is my first review, so sorry if it&#39;s not that good!</p>
