"Jerreke","2012-07-31T07:05:32.65Z","good value for money","<p>I purchased this set for my 4-year old son. He already plays with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4439-1"">large police helicopter 4439</a>&nbsp;but lacked a 'bad guy' and a smaller vehicle for police/bad guy.</p><p>This set has it al: 2 minifigs, 2 vehicles, a small building, extra's to make a small helicopter and some idea's on the box art.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>2 minifigs: bad guy and police-officer</li><li>2 vehicles</li><li>extra parts</li><li>straightforward&nbsp;construction</li><li>ideas on box</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>none: given the price.</li></ul>
<p>Given the price (9 €) it offers great value and playability. It is ideal for smaller children and afterwards it offers two extra vehicles to populate the streets of a lego-city :)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Falcon_Knight","2013-03-10T15:41:03.157Z","Great Value, especially if you are getting a city started","<p>I got this set at the Lego store because I needed a gate to my city and I didn't save enough to buy the Escape From Dragon's Prison. I regret not buying it, but I do not regret buying this. It's cheap, has decent minifigs, and has a cell door. Those who are getting started with their collection, buy this set.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts are nothing special, though there are a few nice parts. The helicopter rotor, the prison door, and a 8 wheels.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are a lot like last year's, though I was a bit confused by the green pants. They now are on a garbage driver. :)<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty easy, no annoying stickers, so what you would expect from Bricks&amp;More.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is a bit basic, but a welcome addition to any [modern-day] collection. It's playable, unlike the Lasha's Byte Cycle (which I will review soon, there are no other reviews), sturdy, and easy to build.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Let's make this brief. Read the title, great set for only $10 USD, and good for smaller children, because it's easy and sturdy, although the quad looks blocky.<br></p><p>…</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
