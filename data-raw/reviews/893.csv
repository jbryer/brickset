<p>I owned this as a kid. Of course because I was very little, I don&#39;t remember building this. This might be my first Lego set also, so it does have a bit of nostalgia. I did have a lot of fun playing with this when I was little. Even though I&#39;m a teen, I give this set a 2&nbsp;as for its&nbsp;target demographic, it was a good set. Lots of pieces to keep a kid entertained. However, this set won&#39;t be as entertaining as the demographic grows.</p>
