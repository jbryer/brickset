"Ypres","2011-12-20T20:20:29.293Z","We asked for something different, and Lego met us halfway. ","<p>This set is kind of like having&nbsp;a surprise birthday party two years in a row. Better yet, you just found out you turned 12 twice courtesy of Lego's frequent memory loss. Even the most devoted City collector at this point must feel like a simpleton after pondering the recurring theme content. ""Crime doesn't stand a chance""... well sure, of course it doesn't when you have two or three other police headquarters within a 16x16 stud radius! While being innovative at heart, having forest themed police sets isn't exactly making the apple fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rated this set a 3/5: which is not my way of saying it's bad, but simply ""Good"". Building Lego is always fun, but sometimes between the dull&nbsp;new parts and the basic building style you get pretty bored with the hokum. It's almost to the point of denial for some people to not admit the attractive qualities in City sets are disappearing. In this Police Station we're given a lot of generic elements (parts, etc)&nbsp;which can't help but leave someone wondering whether purchasing this set was worth saving the extra $30 plus dollars for not having bought the bigger police station released one year prior (which is still available). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing I actually&nbsp;liked best about this set was that I got it for a good deal! The figures, as always, looked great and I can honestly appreciate the exterior architecture of the building. Pros&amp;Cons isn't worth anyone's time because I feel if you're a potential buyer than you should at least possess the ability to determine the integers yourself. I haven't really had much of a chance to say something truly good about the set but it's simply ""what you see is what you get""... and, if you like what you see, don't hesitate to get it! I never expect to see the set's value exceed the Canadian retail of $100. I myself was fortunate enough to get this set for under $50. Oh yes, the stickers are lovely as always,&nbsp;but not if you shake like a man with Parkinson's disease. </p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2012-05-18T21:30:38.993Z","Excellent in the forest, no place for it in the city","Apparently, crime fighting in the city isn't enough for Lego police, so they decided to expand their rule to the forest outside the city. Lego has yet again released another police station this year, but this time, they tried a different approach, and in my opinion, it was quite satisfying.<div><br></div><div>I got this set back in November but I built it just yesterday due to an extremely busy semester at school. The building process was not challenging so it only took 75 minutes to put everything together. The set is divided into 6 bags: one for the hiding rock and ATV, one for the helicopter, one for the police SUV, and 3 for the police station. There is one error in the instruction booklet. The beds in the jail cell are placed backwards in the instructions, as when compared to the box.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once completed you get 5 components to the set: the hiding rock, the ATV, the helicopter, the SUV, and the police station. The parts that came with this set are simply amazing. You get 2 dollar bills, 2 gold bars, 2 mail envelopes, one briefcase, one pair of handcuffs, 2 phones, one shovel, one pickaxe, one crowbar, one flashlight, one burlap sack, one pair of binoculars, and one chainsaw. Special parts include the new ""brick-brick"" (27 of these are included), the stud lights used on the SUV, a bear, and the radar dish with mushroom pattern. You also get a lot of 1x2 log bricks which are great for other creations.</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigures include two redneck robbers, a helicopter pilot, and a male and female ranger. The minifigures are very detailed with printings on front and back.</div><div><br></div><div>The first build is the hiding rock and ATV. The ATV is small but sleek, and on the back of it carries the crowbar, flashlight, and burlap sack with money and gold in it. There is also a hinged hiding rock where the robbers can stash the loot inside. On top of the rock is an intricately detailed tree, and beside the rock is a mushroom.</div><div><br></div><div>The second build is the small helicopter. There are two storing compartments on each side of the helicopter, and the cockpit opens and closes very smoothly. Unfortunately there is no landing pad for the helicopter.</div><div><br></div><div>The third build is the SUV. There is a trunk at the rear that can store small objects. As mentioned before, the headlights and brake lights use the new 1x1 round stud pieces. There is a large, adjustable bumper in front of the grille, and the grille is unfortunately a sticker.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fourth build is the police office. Inside the office, there is a desk with computer, two cups, coffee maker, safe, map (sticker) and newspaper article (sticker). A ladder at the back of the office allows access to the observation bridge. There are also two clips that hold the handcuffs and phone. The driveway gate is extremely flimsy. A large, detailed tree stands just in front of the office, but it is not shown on the box art.</div><div><br></div><div>The final build includes the jail cell and observation bridge. Inside the jail are three beds (but there are only 2 robbers). A play feature is included where the front mailbox can be pushed out, allowing the robbers to escape through the opening. Two doors for one jail cell is excessive, only one is needed. Right outside the jail cell is a fence holding the chainsaw and a signalling device. Not very smart of the police to put a chainsaw right beside a prison cell full of criminals. The observation bridge connects the office and jail cell together. There is a radar dish and radar screen on the bridge. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The architecture of this police station is what separates it from the other stations that were designed for urban areas. The log pieces and brick-bricks give it a true ""foresty"" feel, while the minifigures (rangers and rednecks) are also perfectly appropriate for this set. That being said, this police station is not designed to be placed in a city, so don't expect a full-sized crime lab.</div><div><br></div><div>The driveway is too small to fit the SUV snugly. With the gate closed, the SUV will stick out the back of the building. Also, there is no baseplate for the driveway, but you can easily use your own plates to build the driveway, preferably grey, tan, or brown in colour to simulate dirt or gravel.</div><div><br></div><div>The 3 modules of the police station (office, jail cell, observation bridge) can be separated for easy transport, but when placed together, the station is very flimsy and will require additional bracing. Many people wonder what the extra holes at the back of the office and jail cell are for. They allow you to attach the building in different configurations.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I enjoy this police station very much. The idea of releasing another police station may be excessive but the approach to doing so is a whole other story. The price is kind of steep but I recommend it to any city fan nonetheless.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,3

<p>
 Normally, like most AFOLs I suspect,&nbsp;I have no interest whatsoever in&nbsp;emergency services sets, particularly police stations and cars, which have been done to death since I was a lad in the 1970s. However this year LEGO has managed to breathe some new life into the police theme by moving them from a city setting to&nbsp;the forest, complete with trees, bears, off-road vehicles&nbsp;and hidden booty.</p>
<p>
 <a title=""View set details"" href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4440-1"">4440</a> Forest Police Station is the largest set in the theme and, having just built it, I have to say that it is exceptional both in terms of playability and usefulness of parts. The fun starts as soon as you've built bag 1, which contains the tree, bear, quad-bike, robbers and a female police officer (not shown above). The bag would make an excellent mid-priced set on its own and is one you'd be likely to buy multiples of, for the tree parts and of course the bear.</p>
<p>
 <a title=""4440 Forest Police Station by hmillington, on Flickr"" href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/7887247786/""><img style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; padding: 5px 0px; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); float: left;"" alt=""4440 Forest Police Station"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/7887247786_fbf29fca02_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""155""></a>Bag two builds the Range-Rover style police off-roader, which is also an excellent model.</p>
<p>
 I'm not normally one for applying stickers but a police car without police markings would look a bit daft. As they are printed on transparent backing plastic and not white (which&nbsp;is prone to peeling over time), I made an exception this time.</p>
<p>
 The fourth minifig, another police officer, is provided to drive the vehicle.</p>

It's a bit on the small side&nbsp;and also somewhat juniorised, but it's perfectly functional.</p>
<p>
 Although it adds to the set's playability it could be argued that it's a bit superfluous because, unlike recent police station sets,&nbsp;there is no helicopter landing pad on the police station itself.</p>
<p>
 The pilot is the fifth and final&nbsp;minifig, who has a dark blue torso and legs.</p>
<p>
 The set would make a great one for a family to build together because each sub-assembly has its own instruction book so they can be built concurrently.</p>

The cell doesn't really need two doors as there's no dividing wall, and&nbsp;I'm not really&nbsp;sure what the red letter-box thing between the doors is for: it slides in and out.</p>
<p>
 It's built with plenty of useful parts including 27 'Medium Dark Flesh Brick, Modified 1 x 2 with Masonry Profile' and 33 'Medium Dark Flesh Brick, Modified 1 x 2 Log' bricks so once you're done playing with it, it will make a good parts pack for your own creations.</p>
<p>
 One thing I found unusual was that the set comes with a second tree that is not shown anywhere on the box (or in my photos for that matter). It's not often you get more in the box than you're expecting, is it!</p>
<hr>
<p>
 So despite my initial apprehension and normal dislike of police sets, I&nbsp;will recommend this set particularly at the moment because it's 33% off at all of the European Amazons (except France), making it a much more reasonable £40, or €50.&nbsp;At Amazon.com&nbsp;the discount isn't&nbsp;so great&nbsp;but US$70 is still a good price.</p>

	<li>Two gold money plates</li>
	<li>Two 100 dollor&nbsp;bills</li>
	<li>Ladder</li>
	<li>Mail Tiles&nbsp;</li>

	<li>Two Robbers</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<ul>
	<li>MAIN BUILD:&nbsp;I really like the build. The office is good with the coffee machine. And spinning chair. The jail cells are nice with the added beds. &nbsp;This set has the cool hidden fixture&nbsp;which is that the robbers are able to push the mail box out and escape. I really like the crossing arm to let the cars go in and out.</li>
	<li>CAR: The car can hold one minfig&nbsp;with room in the back for other objects. The wheels on the car are nice they are made for more rough ground.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;HELICOPTER: The copter is nice. It seats one and is a good small build for this set.</li>
	<li>ATV/MONEY HIDEOUT: The atv is a nice build with lots of detail. The tree with the money hideout is a nice build because it seems like something that could actually happen.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All together this set has it all. I love how there is a story involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set I would say that anyone that likes city, should get this set. It has a wonderful price for what you get. I would recommend&nbsp;this set to anyone.</p>

<p>This set is a great &#39;first police station&#39; set to get when starting a Lego City.</p>

<p>However, the inside of this set is rather bland with a desk/chair and a coffee machine on one side and just three prison beds on the other. Not very fun to look at from the back. Also, the only way for the criminals to escape is through the mailbox!</p>

<p>It comes with a decent minifigure collection. The helicopter is mediocre at best, but the jeep/land rover/hummer looking truck is just amazing. I love it&#39;s build and just they way it looks. I still use it in my city to this day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to a great exterior, poor interior, okay minifigures, and decent vehicles I am going to give this set a <strong>3.0</strong></p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T19:11:11.973Z","A little set that tries to be the leader of the Forest, OK running.","<p>This set is playable. I think it does OK as far as that goes, but I think it is a little bit to gappy, and the right wall of the jail is... white. The way its layout goes is that to the left of the building is the office with a desk and a coffee machine, but a majority of the work of an officer is outside, especially in the forest. Then we get to the bridge. It is the only part of the set where I start to feel that it doesn&#39;t raise or lower anything about the set. It really goes up&nbsp;but has a few downsides to it. So it all goes the same for the full set. Perhaps it is giving custom builders reasons to rejoice. It really helps the&nbsp;way the roof goes, although with extra bricks you can fix this, it really completes the scene plus it gives more places for minifigs&nbsp;to be, however, it should have a connected baseplate&nbsp;underneath that. And it should have a real place to put the binoculars. The jail honestly could have been done better, with the wall is white, as mentioned, but it has good playability with the mailbox that is a breakout just&nbsp;begging to happen.</p>
