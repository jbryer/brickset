<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Look and feel: The model really catches the bulkiness of a cargo helicopter</li><li>Quite a large model makes a good platform for one's own modifications</li><li>The structure and detailing of the engines is quite realistic&nbsp;</li><li>Three minifigs</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Cockpit: Pilots can't really see out of the windshield!</li><li>Sliding side door would be much more realistic</li><li>""Useless"" extra room between cockpit and vehicle could use some functionality&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>In general the concept is really good and the exterior design is successful. However, sloppy interior leaves the overall impression far behind the previously mentioned 6482. With your own modifications this model could give many more hours of fun!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good detail without too many special pieces.</li><li>This was my 5 year old's first big set and he needed very little help.</li><li>It is big and bulky in a good way.</li><li>Sturdy enough to play with.</li><li>Includes no guns or other weapons.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Hard to get figures in and out of the cockpit.</li><li>Interior of helicopter could have used a little more thought. There's a wheel inside and I'm not sure why (winch?)</li></ul>
<p>I'm very happy with this set. Having grown up with Lego (I fondly remember my Expert Builder), I'm not sure I like all the specialized pieces today.

"brickscape","2012-03-16T09:16:38.273Z","Good looking helicopter with some major flaws","<p>
 I&#39;m not going to write a detailed review of this set, rather I feel compelled to point out some major high points as well as some glaring flaws (and outright misrepresentation on the part of LEGO).<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 First, let me say that I was very eager to get my hands on this set as it looks very impressive on the box. It is a sizeable model &ndash; the fuselage is about 12&quot; long and 8 studs wide when completed. The rotors each have a span of about 10.25&quot;. It&#39;s also very spacious with the interior space being 6 studs wide and about 6 bricks tall. There only one thing that&#39;s built up inside the helicopter (aside from the cabin) and it&#39;s a bumper-like barrier that stops the ATV when it&#39;s wheeled inside. This bumper can easily be omitted (the resulting gaps in the walls filled with 2 1x2 bricks) to make the interior completely empty and able to be filled with whatever you can imagine. This is a very good looking model.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 On to the aforementioned flaws&hellip; The dark gray rounded bricks that run along the bottom edge of the helicopter are not very secure and often pop off when I hold and manipulate the model. I also feel like the walls are not as strong as they should be, but given the open interior and numerous opening roof panels, I&#39;m not really sure how the walls could be better braced.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The biggest flaw and the one that caused me to write this little review is the horrible design of the cabin. On the plus side, the cabin seats two and there are two yellow chairs, a pair of printed control bricks and a pair of control levers. However, there is a big white window frame placed between the controls and in front of the seats. It looks really awkward and out of place. The frame is needed as structural support for the front rotor assembly, but it just looks awful. The pilots are seated behind this frame and quite a ways back from the windshield. They&#39;re also seated too high to see out the windshield. This height appears to be necessary in order to keep the figures arms from blocking the side doors when they&#39;re in the closed position. But despite this arrangement the figures still get in the way of the doors. Their helmets are pushed by the hinge area of the door as it is closed and the figures ends up tipping a bit off the seats toward the center of the helicopter and towards each other. The designers of this set tried really hard to accommodate two minifigures in this space but it just doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;m going to have to reengineer the entire cabin to be satisfied with the way it functions.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 To add insult to injury (and what really makes me upset) is the box photography. Remember how I said that this set looks very impressive on the box? Well, that&#39;s because they&#39;ve used some photo trickery on the images. The big photo on the front of the box shows the pilot smiling comfortably from the cabin. He seems to be sitting in the position you&#39;d expect for the pilot, close enough and low enough to see out the window. Compare this photo to the assembled model and you&#39;ll realize the pilot can&#39;t physically fit where he&#39;s pictured. He&#39;s sitting inside the instrumentation panel ahead of the white window frame. I&#39;m not sure if this is an example of Photoshop-type editing or if they actually rebuilt the model to shove the figure into this position. Either way, it is a misrepresentation of the actual model. On the back of the box there is a photo of the front of the helicopter showing how the cabin doors swing open and again the pilots look seated in a normal position. This is another doctored photo which is obvious when it is compared to the actual model (in which the pilots&#39; heads are positioned too high to really see through the window). It&#39;s one thing to poorly design the cabin but it is quite another to try and cover up this poor design with false imagery on the box. I expect more from LEGO than this and I&#39;m really quite disappointed.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 So is the set worth the price tag? (US $49.99 / UK &pound;34.99) Given the flaws I really don&#39;t think it is. Now I&#39;m going to fill out the LEGO product survey and let them know how much they&rsquo;ve disappointed me with this one.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 UPDATE: After playing around&nbsp;some more with the model I was able to remedy some of my complaints about the cockpit. Removing the life jackets from the pilots lowers their heads ever so slightly and makes them ever so slightly more able to &quot;see&quot; through the window. The cockpit doors are each constructed with a blue 2x4 plate and this plate ends up hitting the pilots in the head. I swapped the 2x4 plates with 1x4 plates and the pilots can now sit unmolested by the doors (the change does seem to weaken doors a bit). These minor changes improve my opinion of the&nbsp;model but they don&#39;t change my opinion of the photomanipulation on the box.</p>

"middleton83","2012-07-01T10:30:13.017Z","A helicopter or a disaster","<p>It is what I thought would be good, and at first during building I did, but now I just basically hate it becuase it has so many problems, that I personally think it should be recalled and fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because on the big door to the cargo bay, (where the ATV is stored) has a sticker next to the door, and I don't think this works well here.</p>
<p>The Door at the back of the cargo bay, I thought oh this looks nice when I was building it, but when I realised that you put the smooth part on the outside, I thought that was a major problem due to the fact that it would benefit the ATV more facing the other way.</p>
<p>The Forest man on the ATV has no where to put his radio which also gets caught on the side of the cargo bay if not adjusted properly, (On the ATV).</p>
<p>The cabin is just a mess as the pilots look out of place and can't even see out of the windscreen, and there is also a massive chunk of space there which is inaccessible, and the description states that 3 minifigures can fit in the cockpit, they can't because there are only 2 seats but if you removed one seat you could put a couple in the back bit.</p>
<p>It also does not contain any criminals what-so-ever, and I think that the small/cave in set 4441, would work really well with it, and so would a spotlight on the helicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall, I would recommend you not buy this model, because it's ok but not really worth it. If you were going to get it I would recommend you buy a set with criminals in it to go with this or any other forest police sets as they would work really well with this.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,2
"joeyed14","2013-12-25T18:54:55.727Z","A great looking product with some flaws","<p>I received this set for Christmas and I really enjoyed building it. However, towards the end I noticed these things</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Everything feels a little tight - The forest ranger's radio gets caught on the inside of the helicopter and there isn't anywhere to put it.</li><li>I had some problems shutting the cockpit doors at first. The pilots are sat so close that a hand slightly out of place stops the doors shutting properly.&nbsp;</li><li>The space between the vehicle storage and cockpit doesn't appear to have a function, a waste of space for a set that feels to packed in.</li></ul>
<p>There were certainly some great positives though:</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>The model has a great look, the exterior is nicely designed.</li><li>It feels pretty solid, able to withstand some play.&nbsp;</li><li>Instructions were very clear, easy to follow. No confusion there.&nbsp;</li><li>The details of the storage on the buggy initially really impressed me even if the attention to detail was poor later on in the build.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>There are certainly some flaws in this set but they do not ruin the helicopter for me by any means!</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"HuskyDynamics","2022-10-16T19:38:23.7Z","4439 Heavy-Lift Helicopter","<p>Ah, the Heavy-Lift Helicopter.&nbsp; The second-largest set in the 2012 Forest Police subtheme of City, and my favorite one of the theme.&nbsp; This set is a very accurate rendition of a Boeing CH-47 Chinook military helicopter, and is overall a very good LEGO vehicle, though it does have a few notable flaws.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>A very solid and durable build, with the only rather flimsy parts being the rotor blades.</p>

<p>Lots of playability, with the included 6x6 buggy and the numerous doors in&nbsp;the helicopter&#39;s fuselage.</p>

<p>Looks great on display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of the very few conventional twin-rotor helicopters that LEGO has released (one other notable example being set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60125-1/Volcano-Heavy-Lift-Helicopter"">60125</a>), and the vehicle has a very stylish blue, white and grey livery.</p>

<p>A surprisingly accurate model of a CH-47, seemingly in spite of LEGO&#39;s &quot;no-modern-military&quot; policy.</p>

<p>Somewhat detailed cockpit.</p>

<p>Lots of playability.</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>The cockpit seating.&nbsp; The pilots are placed very far back and at the wrong height relative to the windscreen, making it impossible for them to see.&nbsp; However, this was necessary to allow the cockpit doors to open properly.</p>

<p>Stickers.&nbsp; There are 10 stickers in this set, which could be an issue for younger builders or those who dislike applying stickers.</p>

<p>A large portion (1/3 to 1/2) of the interior is completely unused and inaccessible.&nbsp; This can be observed by looking at the outside of the completed model.&nbsp; The entire area between the cockpit doors and the side-mounted door in the cargo bay is completely empty.&nbsp; Worse, it is blocked off inside by a large structural beam.&nbsp; While it would be possible to modify the set to give access to this space, the aforementioned beam has a sticker applied to one of the short ends in a very visible position, and I feel like many builders would not want to risk damaging said sticker.&nbsp; It is disappointing that this interior space is completely unused, as some other play feature such as a winch could have been incorporated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>Overall, 4439 Heavy-Lift Helicopter is a very good set, though it has its share of flaws.&nbsp; The limited interior space is disappointing, especially considering how easy it would have been to utilize this space.&nbsp; However, kids will appreciate this set for its play potential, and older builders can enjoy it as a display set or a quite accurate model of a real-world military helicopter, the Boeing CH-47 Chinook.</p>
