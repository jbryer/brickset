After stopping collecting lego upto round 1999ish i started up again last year after i got my collection back and bought some new sets for my son. Overall im more interested in the older sets but the new ones do have its charm (apart from being huge in my opinion).</p><p><br></p><p>Now onto the actual set. I bought this because i like the idea of the whole <span data-jsid=""text"" class=""commentBody"">mountain police&nbsp; and i wasnt disappointed, although i now have to buy the rest to have a proper mountie set up. The actual build wasnt complicated and everything goes well together although the 'mine' feels like an afterthought and the dog vans holding cell for the thug would be a bit better if there was a plate making it a flat surface for the guy to sit on. Also it would be nice if the dogs didnt slide about in their pen which is easy to rectify with a couple of studded plates. It would have been nice if there was a boot of some kind for the gold bars/crowbar and gem to be placed in. Even though the mine feels like an afterthought i did like the detail with including a beehive.<br></span></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1- the mountie feel of the set. Sets the scence for a nice out of town situation<br></li><li>Pro 2- the added behive adds to the whole feel of a forest</li><li>Pro 3- not overly complicated (which would help with thoses with no patience or younger users)</li><li>Pro 4 -The value for money is pretty good overall</li><li>Pro 5- 2 minifigs and 2 dogs so playability is high<br></li></ul><p><br></p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1- the mine feels like an after thought<br></li><li>Con 2- it would be nice if there was a boot to place the gold/crowbar and gem in</li><li>Con 3- the holding cell for the thug would have been nice to have a flat floor</li><li>Con 4- would be nice if the dogs wasnt on smooth floors <br></li><li>I admit that 3 and 4 are minor cons and can be easily rectified</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Overall its a nice set and cheap enough for a starter set for the mountie theme. Cant wait to buy the other sets to increase the whole playability of everything. I would recommend using set <span class=""text"" id=""id"" itemprop=""identifier"">6761 as a more substantial mine for the thug to loot (building it on a green board makes the mine feel more forestry) <br></span></p>

"Skut","2012-04-23T03:58:06.407Z","""Nice doggie ... AAAARGH!""","<p>Another highlight from the Forest Police lineup. </p>
<p>The Police van is a very solid build and contains space for two Police dogs. There is a holding cell in the back of the van that will accommodate two baddies in comfortable (European) conditions, or up to 4 in less forward-thinking jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The robber's car is a really nice looking souped-up affair. Obviously very good for screaming down a dirt road at 100, spinning out and hitting a tree, leaving the robber to crawl away only to be hunted down by the Police dogs.&nbsp; Hours of entertainment. </p>
<p>The mine with beehive is a nice touch. </p>
<p>Overall a great set with lots of playability. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"weekend3990","2016-04-06T21:21:25.147Z","Lego Police Dog Van Review","<p>The Lego police dog van is an AMAZING set to say the least!</p>

<p>It was my first and only forest police subtheme&nbsp;as none of the other sets really appealed to me. However this set is an exception. The vans design is smooth and sleek, and the level of detail is just perfect. It comes with 2 mini figures, 1 cop and 1 crook. Also the set comes with 2 police dogs. In addition there is a car for the criminal to drive in and there is also a small gold mine. The mine isnt really very good but it can add a possibility of play to this set. Inside the van there is a place for the driver to sit. In the middle there are 2 spaces for 2 police dogs to stand up in. There is a piece that separates both the dogs from one another. At&nbsp;the very back of the van is space for a prisoners to be carried in. There is iron bars at the back so you can see him while inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crook&#39;s car is small yet is just right for the value of the set and there is room for 1 mini figure. The mine looks to be a bit of an after thought as it is a little boring but it does give the crook somewhere to hide.</p>

<p>All in all this is a fantastic set and i would 99.9% recommend this to any Lego city police van.&nbsp;</p>

"LegoMoose","2017-11-15T13:14:07.677Z","LegoMoose's Police Dog Van review ","<p>I am really attached&nbsp;to this set. I remember my dad getting it for me after he had been on a business&nbsp;trip. I built this right away to say the least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The van itself is a great and pleasurable build. You have the driver&#39;s area, then a hatch on the side that swings open (vertically) and you have just the right amount of space for the two dogs to sit in there separated by a little fence piece. In the back you have this large area for you to put your criminal in.</p>

<p>The criminal&#39;s hotrod is nothing special, and the little mine build is a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;are great, getting a cop, a robber, and two dogs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to somewhat expensiveness of the set for the size that it is, I am giving this set a <strong>4.2&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have a good day/evening and happy building,</p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T22:38:28.5Z","Awesome set","<p>One of my favorite sets ever, the main build is a dog carrier. But the car is not favored for mountain travel. Not much to say, just that the cars are good in a real city. Two Minifigures and one dog put the set in the Police&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>All and all</b>&nbsp;this is a great set, through and through.</p>
