"Lost_Cosmonaut","2011-12-22T21:19:08.37Z","Great little set","<p>Fun little set with a great 4x4 and a cool ATV.&nbsp; I put the rear fender on the ATV ""backwards"" to make it look a little more realistic compared to how the instructions show it.&nbsp; Makes it better in my opinion.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great 4x4 and ATV<br></li><li>Crowbar</li><li>Ranger hat</li><li>The truck's lightbar and trunk<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only one dollar bill and one ""gold brick""...&nbsp; Not enough to be running from the police from IMO!</li><li>A little simplistic, giving the truck working suspension of some sort would have made this kit much better<br></li></ul><br>
<p>I really like the new ""Off Road"" Police &amp; Fire sets.&nbsp; Definitely will be getting more in the future.&nbsp; My sights are squarely set on the new 4209 Fire Plane.&nbsp; It looks AWESOME.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"What_Sup_Lego_Fans","2012-01-24T03:37:50.977Z","4437 Police Pursuit - Something like 3648 would be better.","<p>The 4437 Police Pursuit contains 129 pieces with 2 minifigures. This is a good set but it wont be your&nbsp;favorite. I wish this set was something like the 3648 Police Chase.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice bandit car with his gold bar and money.</li><li>2 minifigures, especially the forest policeman.</li><li>Atv goes well with the normal 2011 police Atv.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>How could a small Atv catch a bandits car.</li><li>A small police car would have been great.</li><li>A mine would be a nice addition.</li><li>Price per piece is bad.</li></ul><div>Although it has a few minor cons, it is still a great set to buy.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"cbowers","2012-12-24T00:40:47.743Z","Forest Sets are Creative and a good change from City Police","I know this is a small set. So I will be as brief as possible. I bought this set at a Lego (R) store in Raleigh, NC. After years of city police officers and such it is nice to have this forest feel, and highway patrol like system of police to add to the collection. I was hoping that Lego would keep the theme active. It seems that I let some of the special more particular sets slip by only sold at Target and Toys R Us. Luckily they still had this one in stock.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This set reminds me of old 4x4 sets they used to have that only have as just the off road truck back in the early 90s. Those little sets were always great. I loved vehicle sets. I think that putting this truck together reminded me of that in that finally the chasis was not one of those block pieces and you had to construct the truck up from a plate. That was refreshing. Lego still included a few combined parts that could be more fun if in smaller parts. But, I seem to be losing the battle up front from changing Lego back to all small parts...i.e. you would be able to build more things with smaller parts because they break down to smaller components and can be re-used more ways....but hey, kids these days just are in too much of a hurry to complete the model.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, as a finished product the 4x4 truck is excellent. A great addition may be some sort of running boards to fill out an undercarriage. The atv is a little sparse, but I ended up liking it more than I did on the box. It would be great in the wilderness and can be spruced up by spare parts as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Great job Lego in keeping fans interested and kids as well, by thinking outside the box on this forest line.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
