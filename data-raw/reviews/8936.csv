"Mathtrains","2012-03-25T21:06:00.413Z","Major Improvements","<p>
	This ambulance marks a return of the emergency medical line, and is combined with the &quot;Great Vehicles&quot; line. Do the two combined make a great set that is due to return, or should both be sent back to the idea board?</p>
<h4>
	Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>
	The instructions and sticker sheet were slightly bent, but still very usable. The box could have been slightly smaller, but this was not a bad size, unlike the larger sets.</p>
<h4>
	Parts</h4>
<p>
	The new stretcher is very useful and a major improvement. It can be used for many more things, and minifigures lay better on it. The green bicycle may been nice for some people, but I am now to the point of where I want some new colors.</p>
<h4>
	Minifigures</h4>
<p>
	The new EMT torso is great, and this set includes two! The medical logo is on the back, and looks good for layouts. The other minifigure is very basic. It is nice that LEGO is giving females jobs in the emergency fields.</p>
<h4>
	The build</h4>
<p>
	The build is fairly standard, with only a few pieces being needed each time. Somewhat rare, the corner is build last, after the ambulance. That type of model would normally be first, not last. I like the new way better.</p>
<h4>
	The completed model</h4>
<p>
	This ambulance looks very modern, clean, and is very functional. The back door is slightly odd, but it probably makes everything else work better. The side doors are slightly elevated when the windshield is pushed down, making me thing that the pieces I received might have been slightly warped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	For the first time, an EMT can actually monitor the patient instead of leaving the patient alone. The stretcher fits in well in the ambulance, and it does seem to bump very much when on roads.</p>
<h4>
	Summary</h4>
<p>
	This ambulance is the right way for the emergency medical line to return. I cannot wait for the hospital this summer. This is a great vehicle and I am glad the emergency medical line has returned. Combining this, the Series 6 Surgeon, the Series 1 Nurse(if you have it, which I don&#39;t), and some assorted bricks will make a great custom hospital, or you can wait for the summer release of the official hospital. This is a major improvement, and should be on the roads of your city. If it is not, go and get it on your roads. Your minifigures deserve it!</p>

"stagus","2012-01-30T09:37:27.43Z","Nice but not perfect.","<p>
	This set is nice but I can&#39;t help thinking it could&#39;ve been nicer.&nbsp; 3 minfigs with the paramedics in snazzy new red uniforms is excellent but the actual ambulance is a bit &#39;clunky&#39; looking at the front and should have been better.&nbsp; What I am getting at is that the bonnet is made up of slopes that slightly overhange the lights, it just doesn&#39;t sit well with my eye (maybe it&#39;s just me).&nbsp; The rest of the vehicle is nice AND it has proper doors.&nbsp; The usual additions to this set with traffic lights and a corner of pavement (sidewalk?) will increase the playability for all.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Nice minifigs</li>
	<li>
		Lots of playability</li>
	<li>
		Proper doors</li>
	<li>
		Nice rear to the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		A lot of stickers on the front</li>
	<li>
		Front end looks a bit square</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So as said before nice set, easy build but could have been a bit nicer.&nbsp; Should go well with the planned hospital later this year.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Overall 4/5 for me.</p>

For example, you know that 4433 Dirt Bike transporter is a accident waiting to happen.

I'd like to start out by saying that this is the best ambulance set to date, and its really good looking overall. However, they needed to calm down with the stickers. I thought the sticker that said ""ambulance"" was lame so i didn't use it. I think dropping that sticker really improved the appearance of the model.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Counter to what I just said, I thought the dashboard sticker was a really good idea. While I would have preferred if it were a printed image, I think this sticker adds a lot of detail to the cock pit of this vehicle.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, at first I thought the front would be a little to boxy, but after I built it, it grew on me. I especially like the blue head lights tat come forward on the top.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I appreciated how they made enough room for a medic to sit in the back with the patient. I also thought that the clear piece with the blue nozzle was a cool idea for an oxygen tank</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"crosseyedpirate","2012-04-07T22:39:35.76Z","Just not that exciting and not worth $20","I was excited to get this set for $15 when it was on sale at Target a few weeks ago, but after building it I was pretty disappointed, even having gotten it for a discount. &nbsp;The stretcher is probably the coolest part, now I can put any minifigure on the stretcher and it is especially fun if you have someone like Davy Jones to put on there. &nbsp;The crab claw gets a whole new context. &nbsp;But aside from that, the vehicle itself is kind of weak, the roof opens for easy access but what ambulance really works like this? &nbsp;Additionally the red pieces that create the stripes on the sides, don't line up with what are stripes/taillights on the rear. &nbsp;The entire back swings up, again, it shouldn't be that hard to use a two door system like you would expect from an ambulance. &nbsp;I thought it would be fun to add an ambulance to the various sets I have but was disappointed. &nbsp;This set is not worth $20 in my opinion and given another chance to buy it with hindsight I think I would pass for the $15 I got it for as well.",FALSE,2,3,3,4,3

"Percypoppins","2022-01-03T06:21:31.277Z","A very playable set","<p>I only had some parts to this set, it was acquired from a seconds shop, although I&#39;ve now acquired the other pieces to make the set complete, which was an easy process.</p>

<p>I love how the tailgate lifts-up but think it would be better with side swing doors, but hey, variety is the spice of life. A panel in the roof lifts-up which is neat, however, mine is a bit sticky and the top tends to fall&nbsp;off.</p>

<p>This is a very playable set and I quite like it.&nbsp;</p>
