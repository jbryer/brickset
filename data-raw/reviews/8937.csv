"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-24T22:50:50.407Z","Garbage stinks - this set does not.","If you were to ask me to compile a list of things that people find appealing - whether they be kids or adults - I have to admit that a garbage truck is not the first thing that comes to my mind. They're large, unsightly, smelly, and always seem to be clanging around the neighbourhood on the mornings when you're trying to sleep in. Yet, it's clear that garbage workers (or ""sanitation specialists"" as we're probably supposed to call them nowadays) provide a vital service to any community, as the <a href=""http://www.workers.org/2011/us/1968_sanitation_workers_0113/"">1968 New York and Memphis strikes</a> in the United States quickly proved, so perhaps there is a reason to allow kids to get a chance at cleaning up the mean streets of LEGO - not that there would be much littering going on, given the near-perpetual levels of police surveillance.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The Garbage Truck is the latest (as of 2012) in a long series of garbage trucks that have rolled out of LEGO's engineering department, but this is the first of its kind that I have owned, and I love every inch of it. You get a piece count that's appropriate for a set of this price, and you also pick up a pair of sanitation worker Minifigs, a very good deal for a vehicle set, and one that makes complete sense since sanitation workers usually work in pairs in real life anyway. This augments a very satisfying build that results in a good-looking model, and also one that works amazingly well to boot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The front of the truck is excellent as always, and its flat front and removable roof should come as no surprise to anyone who has even one other LEGO truck (I personally recommend the Tank Truck (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3180-1"">3180</a>), it being a personal favourite among the ones that I own thus far). The most exciting thing about this model - and one that is not readily apparent from the pictures - is the collection and dumping mechanism that fit flawlessly together into the truck's construction. At the back of the truck, there exists one mechanism for emptying the trashcan into the truck's interior, a second mechanism for opening the back of the truck (probably to in a policeman to come searching for narcotics or pirated DVDs or communist leaflets or whatever it is LEGO policeman are constantly searching for), and a third that allows the truck to tip out its unwanted contents into the dumping ground of your choice (perhaps you could use one of those old raised Castle baseplates and use that as a landfill instead?). Oh, and did I mention that those gloriously curved side panels are easily removable for even more access to the inside of the truck? Well, I did now, and they do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Garbage Truck is the first of the 2012 vehicles that I own, and I am completely won over. If you are a vehicle enthusiast, a City collector, or are just looking for a feature-heavy vehicle with lots of playability, Garbage Truck is exactly what you want. I usually shy away from giving the hyperbolic five bricks for everything, but I really cannot think of what I could possibly fault this set over, except perhaps for including a vexing collection of round stickers. Make sure you apply them before the eggnog.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"bluemodern","2011-11-27T20:46:22.223Z","Excellent garbage truck. ","I had the 6693 Refuse Collection Truck as a kid and this set seems much more realistic and larger. This set also seems to have a wider base than the 6693 set.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>On the back side is a black steering wheel that turns and is connected through a technic part to the trash can holder base that allows for dumping the contents of the trash can into the back of the truck, which is a very nice touch. The set comes with two garbage cans, one green and one gray. As trash there are two fish, a&nbsp;banana&nbsp;peel, and some light and dark brown 1x1 round plates. The set has two minifigures, a male and a female garbage worker. I think this is the first time Lego has included a female garbage worker. I think this is nice for children to see different gender roles. On the minus side there are no doors on the front of the garbage truck. The garbage truck is a very nice green and white color. For 208 pieces at $20, the value is pretty good at slightly less than $0.10 per piece. There are quite a few extra pieces as well.

"Monty","2012-03-05T18:16:49.077Z","Not Rubbish - In Fact Very Good","<p>This set appeared in the UK around Christmas time and I thought about getting it a few times. I cracked and bought it in our local supermarket last week and made it this weekend.</p>
<p>The parts come in 2 bags so you are advised to build them in sequence shown to minimise the parts search.</p>
<p>The build is farily straightforward and uses some of the new 2012&nbsp;elements, including the brighter green elements which are the same colour used for some baseplates.&nbsp;There is a tipping mechanism worked by a wheel on the side which&nbsp;lifts and empties the bins into&nbsp;the rear of the body.&nbsp;The the rear of the body lifts up so the whole body can be tipped and emptied.&nbsp;There are 2 minifigs, 2 dustbins and assorted rubbish comprising 2 fish and a banana and some 1x1 round bricks so you have somethin to tip - good playability.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I was a small child, I&nbsp;was absolutely fascinated by the weekly visit of the dustcart as we called it, and&nbsp;I would watch as the hydraulics&nbsp;tipped our bin up and would then see it retun to the ground amazingly empty. Things have moved on a lot in the design and appearance of these vehicles since then, but buying this model has rekindled my interest in the machines. I decided the front looked like a DENNIS machine which are everywhere in the UK so i made a moc DENNIS sticker for the front.</p>
<p>The colours match those of my local Council, and&nbsp;I think that is also what drew me to it -&nbsp;I have added some moc stickers with the local Council's logo as well as tweaking the colours to add some lime green too which matches the local vehicles.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;enjoyed the build and making my modifications, including actually removing the oversize tipping mechanism and adding an extra set of rear wheels as most larger DENNIS dustcarts seem to have 2 axles at the rear. I also removed the side handrails and the brush and shovel clipped to the rear, and replaced them with a side control panel instead, but the set remains basically the same.&nbsp;I like the overall look and playability with the 2 minifigs 2 dustbins and assorted rubbish as well as the price so&nbsp;I have awarded it a maximum overall score, and would recommend it to anyone.</p>

"Lint","2012-05-29T05:15:07.23Z","The Trash is Treasure","<p>This year's garbage truck set comes with a very modern looking garbage truck, 2 garbo minifigs (male and female), 2 trash cans and an assortment of trash including fish, bananas and pieces of, well... trash. The truck itself comes with rails for the garbos to hang onto, clips for their tools and a trash loading and dumping mechanism.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of great pieces for a city set. Plenty of enviro-green and transparent orange pieces as well as minifig accessories such as trash cans, fish, banana, broom and shovel.</li><li>Build was actually quite fun for a simple set.<br></li><li>Rubber tyres. Love em</li><li>Smokestack. Love it<br></li><li>The trash loading gimmick is great fun<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The trash loading and dumping mechanism doesn't work TOO well. It's a challenge to get all the trash deep into the trash compartment, trash tends to fall out of the truck if it goes over a bump and the dumping gimmick can be a bit hit and miss.<br></li><li>Cab can only fit one minifig and he has to climb in through the roof. I know this is the norm with modern set design but I still have the right to complain :P</li><li>Minifigs are a bit plain. They could have simulated some dirtyness to their overalls to give them character.</li><li>Stickers<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall you get a really good looking garbage truck and a few new accessories to decorate your city with. Even if the play gimmicks are a little broken, this set wins with visual appeal alone and will fit in well with your Lego City!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"itsaturkey","2012-02-17T23:08:52.14Z","Trash Never Looked So Good!","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was never very interested in City, but I don't know why. Every City 
set I've ever gotten I've loved. This set was no exception. The build 
was stimulating and took me half an hour to complete at a 
comfortable/slow pace. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's broken up in two bags, the truck in one and 
the trash compacter in the other. Both are relatively simple builds and 
should create a fun experience for any fan of Lego. The instructions are
 easy to read but do not feature the bricks needed for that page in the 
upper left corner that are included in more complicated builds. Not a 
big issue unless the builder is very young. The driver compartment fits one minfigure and a steering wheel. The roof pops up and allows you to access the seat. The only downside is that there is no door. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The back is broken up in two sections, the tank and the trash flipper. The tank is simple and sleek and quite sturdy. Two bars on the side allows a Minifig to hold on for the stops. 
The color is light-ish green and white. Downside is that the front has a
 big whole that trash will sometimes fly by and hit the driver if you 
flick the trash hard enough. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trash flipper is attached to the tank 
with a lever. A switch with a wheel on the side will dump a trash cans 
trash into the tank. This provides lots of playability. No problem with 
this that I can see. The tank leans back and can dump out the trash. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
includes two trash cans, a grey one and a blue one. Also included is two
 fishes and a banana along with a shovel and a broom. The two minfigures are nothing special, but both 
have blue overalls and short baseball caps. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall a very worthwhile purchase, filled with a stimulating build, some special pieces and accessories and a lot of playability along with two minifigures.

"DrOrrery","2012-04-13T06:09:46.347Z","Looks good, but not great for play","<p>This is one of a half dozen city vehicle sets all in the same price range. &nbsp;I've previously bought the forest fire truck (4208) and thought that was an excellent set, so I was looking forward to this set a great deal. &nbsp;The fact that it looks excellent on the box also helped, but in this case looks are slightly deceiving.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>2 numbered packets for easy building. &nbsp;Quite a few stickers but the model looks good without them if you don't feel like applying them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The set is mostly green and white, with quite a few orange transparent bricks including some cheese wedges. &nbsp;There's nothing particularly strange apart from perhaps the exhaust pipe on the truck, but it's a good mix of pieces. &nbsp;However, at 208 pieces it's a bit light on compared to other sets in a similar price range.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set has 2 minifigures, identical apart from the heads.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's a straightforward but fun build, starting with the chassis and cabin. &nbsp;This will be fairly familiar to anyone who has built any of the recent lego trucks. &nbsp;The side mirrors are done differently to most others I've seen, with hinge connectors slanted up, but most of it is fairly straight forward. &nbsp;The garbage section is much more interesting, with a wheel for tipping the garbage bins into the back of the truck and a large hinge that allows the entire back section to open up. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once completed, the model looks great. &nbsp;What you see on the box is what you get, a fairly accurate looking garbage truck with very nice curves on the side and a working bin tipping and load tipping action. &nbsp;I can definitely not fault it for looks.</p><p>Playability is a different matter. &nbsp;The most troubling problem with this set is it is really difficult to pick up. &nbsp;The first inclination is to grab the curved garbage storage section on the back. &nbsp;The trouble is, this hinges and the connection to the hinge (a 3x2 surface) cannot take ANY weight at all. &nbsp;The chassis will fall off it immediately. &nbsp;So you have to remember to pick it up by the chassis. &nbsp;But if you do that and accidently tip it at all, the garbage storage section will hinge back, fall off and break in to a dozen pieces. &nbsp;The sides panels here are only held on by a 2x1 surface, which means they come off easily. &nbsp;This is a double edged sword, useful if something has got stuck in there that shouldn't, but also meaning that if you drop it at all they come off. &nbsp;In fact the whole storage section is pretty weak and will shatter very easily.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a really good looking set, but if you buy it to play with then expect to spend half your time putting it back together again. &nbsp;Personally, I think the forest fire set (4208) beats it hands down. &nbsp;That said, it does look good and there's a decent amount of playability there, just don't pick it up.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3
