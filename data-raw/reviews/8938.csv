Even our local lego store does not have this set as it was sold out. Finally spotted this beauty at a Target store and&nbsp;boom, now its and addition to my collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review, this set comes with two instructions, as well as two bag of legos. Makes sense to me as the first bag is for the 4x4&nbsp;in accordance with the first instruction, second bag is for the dirt bike transporter with its corresponding second insturction. Each bag has a mini bag inside for the smaller elements, i guess to keep them together and not get mixed with the big elements, in which in the end you will still somehow mix them together.&nbsp;Set has two minifigures, one minifigure was at each bags, both has red cap and can wear the two dirt bike helmet on the trailer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the 4x4 on this set, kinda the same as the 4WD with Horse Trailer (7635) but this one is a sporty one ofcourse. Seat in this 4x4 is in the middle, which cannot have a passenger sitting inside. Its also good coz more elbow room for the minifigure. Im not a big fan of the car hood, though i understand lego pips are being creative to make the build different from the usual car, but on this one they should have&nbsp;went with the curve hood like the&nbsp;one used for its roof. Fog light is not a wow as well, but i do love the new light piece they have been using. I think they have a new element on this set, the one they used for the spare tire. Its a round four stud piece with four pegs to hold the spare tire. Got me confused at first as the tire it was holding is not the actual spare for the 4x4, it actually was a spare for the dirtbike and this set does not have an actual&nbsp;spare for the 4x4...hmmmm? Back door of the 4x4 is awesome but somehow it feels like its too short for the actual car, it does have a gap. Nothing biggy, nothing&nbsp;like&nbsp;a little mod can't fix. Other than that this 4x4 if fantastic and im loving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the dirt bike trailer, first build was the&nbsp;green then the orange one. Then two flags with base then the trailer itself. First question is why does the trailer does not have&nbsp;big wheels like on the 4x4? Trailer tires does look really small. We got two yellow fire extinguisher, a pair of two drawer tool box ( it does not have rollers or wheels so why does it have push handle, just curious). On the top of the drawer box the two helmet is mounted which look cool, in which you can also put the cap when the minifigure is wearing the helmet. This set has a bunch of tools in which you can actully put inside the tool box drawer, i just dont know where the oil thingy goes on this set. On the trailer you can also put the flag with base, and inbetween the flags the&nbsp;dirt bike holders is located. Build was ingenious but only concern is from time to time the bike snaps out, or swings sideways. Would&nbsp;have been nicer if they put a fold up side railings&nbsp;to keep the bike inside. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with all the little things i saw that can be improved I love this set and its a great addition to my city collection. Besides, everybody can say this should have been done this way, that way. In the end the lego pips do amazing work and if we want to&nbsp;see those changes made, it does mean higher price right? Awesome set, and buying it will be a good investment.</p>

The trailer its a flatbed type but if MOC'd right you haul a small car with it or and small side walls to it you can lumber to scrap with it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Hobie819","2012-12-28T14:48:11.623Z","Great set with a few good part suprises","<p>Purchased this set with my 4 year old son - he picked it out. I wasn't too impressed based on the box image but it turned out nicely.&nbsp;I didn't realize it at first but I havent actually seen many LEGO SUVs that aren't police or fire, so this one is a nice addition to a city.&nbsp; It is a nice looking SUV as well, looks like a European model with a low front end and high cargo compartment,&nbsp;kind of like a landrover&nbsp;(at least to my American eyes).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are set up with 2 sub models, each with its' own instructions. The first instruction is the SUV, the second instruction booklet being the trailer.&nbsp; There were no alternate images on the back of the box showing other things you can build with the pieces which I normally enjoy looking at but alas, not a big deal. Nothing hard or difficult with the instructions themselves. My 4 year old never missed a piece in the instructions so nothing was hidden from view.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I didnt think much of the set when my son picked it out. I love all LEGOs but was hoping he'd pick a building due to the large numbers of vehicles we own, actually. Havign said that I was pleasantly suprised with a few of the parts.&nbsp; The sliding drawer tool box was superb and made my day when I saw it.&nbsp; Part wise there wasn't much else that screamed out at me, but all of the parts can easily be used in other builds - nothing that would be hard to include in another build. There are a lot of tires in this set and 3 different kinds. You get 4 normal tires for the SUV, 4 small tires for the trailer and 5 motorcycle tires for a total of 13 wheels.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Nothing extraordinary about the minifigs in this set. They have OCTAN jumpsuits and they have red baseball caps and extra helmets for when they decide to ride the bikes. It seems as if they have dual roles as mechanics and racers though which kind of turned me off a bit. I would have liked to see more logos on the uniform if they were racers - it just seems out of place to me for them to be mechanics that race their bikes in their mechanics outfits.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing complex here - my 4 year old son was able to put it together with minimal assistance in about 45 minutes. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It turned out quite nice actually. I ended up loving the SUV but wish they would have added one more tile to the back door so when it is closed there wasn't a very small gap showing between the door and the vehicle frame.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Despite my reservations on the minifig selection, the set itself is a nice set, one that I dont remember being a repeat at least in recent times unlike many of the other models that have or are coming out. It's something that fits the off road theme of 2012 but can easily work in a city environment as well. I was happy that we purchased the set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Lint","2012-05-29T07:44:26.117Z","Surprise hit of CITY 2012","<br><p>I bought this set as my #3 choice in a buy 2 get 1 free deal. While from the outside this set looks extremely underwhelming compared to it's sister sets (ambulance, camper, garbage and tipper trucks) it is surprisingly excellent as it checks all the right boxes in building experience, parts, playability AND price! I'm calling this the surprise hit of 2012 for the City line.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very interesting build. This may be because 4WD vehicles and bike trailers are not as common in the CITY line as vans, trucks and sedan cars. I found the 4WD vehicle especially rewarding to build and consider it one of the best vehicles in terms of visual appeal + functional accuracy.<br></li><li>Great set of parts: Lots of workshop tools, 2 dirt bikes, 2 sets of shelves, lots of large plate pieces, rubber tires, smoky glass pieces, tire mount, I could go on. This set has a lot of both useful and interesting pieces. In particular this is the first time I've come across the flat faced circular transparent studs. They are a wonderful piece indeed.</li><li>Not featured on the box but the rear of the 4WD opens up and you can store stuff in the back.</li><li>Trailer articulation works great<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers, but to their credit there are not too many of them and the set looks perfectly fine without them.<br></li><li>I found the flag pods a little silly. I think lego could have come up with something better.</li><li>Minifigures are extremely bland.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I love this set. I was certainly not expecting much at all when I bought it but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it's design. Highly recommended for both adults and children and even people who are not into Lego.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Leggo_my_LEGO","2012-03-02T22:25:00.86Z","A great set for a great price","<p>I got this set along with the Police Helicopter (7741) from 2008 when I went to Toys R Us with my mom, and I must say that even with the slightly inflated prices that us Canadians suffer from ($20 dollars in the US, $25 here) when it comes to LEGO I am still very happy with the purchase!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The build was pretty fun and easy, and I like how rugged but sporty the front looks, what with the black grille pieces and the grey (bley? im not good with AFOL terms) studded parts on the front. There's also a nifty little thing on the roof of the truck for a spare bike tire. It also has ""off-road"" tires that are smoother and rounder then the tires used on most vehicles made by LEGO today, giving it a tougher look.</li><li>I think one of the main Pro's is that they used the smokey colored windows, instead of those godawful cyan ones. Using them exclusively for the Police is perfectly fine with me, it makes sense with the white and light blue color scheme, but anything else just makes it way too ""cartoony"".</li><li>I like the color scheme they used for the truck, it gives it a sporty look but at the same time says ""If your never going to take me offroading, im just going to &nbsp; destroy the battery over and over until you sell me to someone that will!""...I'm &nbsp; &nbsp; not sure where that came from.</li><li>Lets not forget playability! I think the flag things add to it a lot, because you can race them around your living room and that can be the finish line. But wait! Oh &nbsp; &nbsp; no! There's an emergency! The tire flew off, and it is totaled. Good thing theres a spare on the roof! The other bike is starting to make weird noises! Better put &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some oil in it to be safe and not sorry.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons&nbsp;</h4><div>Just me being a perfectionist im pretty sure, but I don't like how LEGO uses the</div><div>Octan jumpsuits for pretty much everything even if the vehicle they drive doesn't</div><div>even have a little sponsor sticker sporting its logo.</div><div><br></div><div>The oil can thing doesn't fit in any of the drawers, so you kind of have to just throw it in the back and have it rattle around spraying oil everywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>It looks kind of odd having the bikes on the very edge of the trailer, but im not &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sure how you could secure them to the trailer without doing that so I guess this &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is like a phantom Con.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>All in all, I think this set is very worthwhile. If you see it on the shelf, grab it. You &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; won't regret it! It honestly looks way better in person than it does on the box. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly, I would just like to say thank you for reading this, because I know KFOL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reviews are usually pretty...below average. I try my best to avoid that. I hope &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this review helps you make that decision when you see those 2 sets on the shelf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that you have always wanted!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"CityIsAwesomne","2018-12-07T15:20:46.34Z","This Truly Is Fantastic Vehicles!","<p>You know in 2012 there was this lego city sub theme known as fantastic vehicles, literally, not everyone may think they&#39;re fantastic but I guess some things just aren&#39;t fair. Anyway. This sub theme was basically different types of vehicles, anything from ambulances, dump trucks, cement mixers, almost anything, however if you want a truly epic set from this sub theme then this is for you. 4433 Dirt Bike Transporter is a set consisting on a giant car with a trailer which bears two dirt bikes and gadgets plus two minifigures.</p>

<p>So as stated above, the build consists of a big car used for transporting dirt bikes that has lots of grey, red and black on it. It has room for one driver and the other minifigure could just chill in the back of the car. I like the colour combination as it actually gives a feel of racing, the car also has many decorations on it such as stickers and lamps, there is even a tire on top of it, the car also has a much thinner trailer in which two dirt bikes are placed, hence the build is a dirt bike transporter. The dirt bikes are a green which has the number 6, or 9 if you prefer, and an orange with an 8 on it. I find them to look quite colourful and they offer loads of playability. On the trailer is also chest of drawers in which things such as oil, wrenches can be found. This build even comes with two small flags probably meant for a start and finish point as this is dirt bike racing, you know when a set comes with this much things it&#39;s awesome!</p>

<p>Even the minifigures are quite nice, while not like masterpiece or anything they are great for what they are. One of them has a bit if a mischievous expression and the other one seems more serious and has orange glasses on him. Both minifigures have the same clothing though, as they have a red cap and blue officer clothes which are colourful. So yeah, maybe not a five in terms of minifigures but a four definitely.</p>

<p>Playability rate instantly rises to a strong five. I mean, one big car with many decorations and racing stickers, may have one seat but minifigures could also rest in the back, a trailer that has room for two dirt bikes and a chest of drawers having gadgets like wrenches, oil and even helmets on top of it, speaking of helmets, the dirt bikes that look so good as offers loads of more playability and two flags that can be used for a starting point and finish point and two minifigures with facial expressions that can lead to so many different play styles! How can I not give it a five?</p>

<p>For once the value for money isn&#39;t that bad either for such a great set! 30 bucks for this big amount of content and playability is what I call a deal, it&#39;s as fun as playing say Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga on the Nintendo 3DS, they are both equally fun and have pretty much the same price</p>

<p>Final Score: <strong>5/5</strong> or <strong>10/10</strong>, this is what a great set should have! Excellent builds and high playability rate and some cool minifigures and all for a great price! This is a must buy for any Lego City fan</p>
