"bluemodern","2011-11-29T00:20:36.243Z","Good set, but a car with no doors or seats? ","I bought this set during a buy 1 get 1 half off sale at TRU with the 4432 Garbage Truck. I have the 7639 Camper and the 5766 Log Cabin sets so I thought this would be a nice fit for a camping theme.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The first thing that surprised me about this set was the size. Both the car and camper are larger than I expected. The camper itself is the same size as the 7639 camper/rv. I was not expecting that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i.imgur.com/6XnGEl.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Both the car and camper look great at first glance but there are some troubling details (for me) when you look at it closely. I worry that this year's sets look more like models than sets you play with. Overall, the car looks nice. I thought the back window looked odd in the photos (it is the same shape as the front wind shield) but in person it looks good. There are no doors and no seats in the car. I think there are a lack of seats so that both minifigures fit in the car one behind the other.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The camper also doesn't have a door, I think including that would have been a nice touch (How they are supposed to get in I don't know). The camper opens up in the back like the 7639 camper set but instead of both sides opening on that one, only one side opens up on this set. The contents of the camper seem too similar to the 7639 set. They both have a red&nbsp;bicycle, two red mugs, a sticker that stands in for a TV and a frying pan. This set has a camp fire with two red sausages instead of a fish from the 7639 camper but overall this set seems much more similar to the 7638 camper than I anticipated.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/s0UOml.jpg[/img]</span></span>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The swinging out part of the camper is held together by a 2x2 plate with an ""L"" shape (that holds the dish) on the roof. It seems to work well and is an unexpected solution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This set is $20 (regular price) for 218 pieces, so it feels like a good value, particularly for the size of the car and camper. Overall, this is a good set but if you have the 7639 Camper you may want to pass on this set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"xccj","2012-01-25T22:30:40.937Z","Surprisingly Good","<p>To be fair, I don't like real campers; if you want to go camping for real, you should pitch a tent and rough it out.&nbsp; Still, I decided that I should buy the Car and Camper set and see how city folks go camping.&nbsp; I mostly wanted it for the figs, but it ends up having a nice built and contains many useful parts.&nbsp; It's not a revolutionary City set, but it's still fun and comes at a decent price too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two figs help you fill your town with regular civilians.&nbsp; The man comes with a green sweater vest (not new, but this is the cheapest set to get it in) and dark brown tousled hair (which is becoming the commonplace male hairstyle nowadays.)&nbsp; The woman comes with a brand new medium blue female shirt and Dastan's hair in dark tan.&nbsp; Overall, these two figures aren't amazing, but they're great for every-day style of figures.&nbsp; The set also provides them with some cups, two sausages, a camp fire, and a red bicycle, so they have a lot to do while they're camping.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The yellow car uses the new standard car built.&nbsp; I do love the build, but it is starting to get repetitive, as all the cars from the last two years seem to have the same basic design.&nbsp; The main difference here is the trailer attachment.&nbsp; Still, it uses some decent SNOT techniques, and has some great yellow slopes.&nbsp; Plus, there's room enough in the interior for both minifigs to sit.&nbsp; My biggest gripe would be the roof design, which just doesn't seem to fit on correctly.&nbsp; I don't know if it's an issue with the roof piece or the two windows, but it's annoying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the bulk of the pieces are used to construct the camper.&nbsp; It contains a decent amount of pieces, from dark red plates and tiles to white slopes and panels to various trans blue windows.&nbsp; The one side flips opened on a hinge to show the interior, where there are two chairs, a bed, and what appears to be a kitchen area.&nbsp; Overall, the whole thing is relatively sturdy but still manages to be roomy on the inside.&nbsp; If you want, stickers are provided to add some more details to the panels.&nbsp; And when you're finished, you can attach the camper to the back of the car and head off on an outdoor vacation... as long as your campsite has RV hookups, anyway. ;-)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it's a decent set with a good build and some nice pieces.&nbsp; If you want some regular civilian figs or a decent car, then it's a good set to buy.&nbsp; However, if you've already got&nbsp;a lot of car&nbsp;sets from recent years and you don't need yellow or dark red elements, then you could pass on this set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Legobuilderguy","2012-02-21T02:24:46.627Z","Back to the simple life","I got this set basically for the car and the mini figures. Having put the whole thing together though I can say that I am glad I got it. Now for a bit about the features of the set.<br><br>The car is pretty nice if something we have seen variances of before, it still looks good. The over all color is yellow with some grey highlights on the sides. The big difference with this car is the trailer hitch and that both of the mini figures, bent slightly back, can both sit in the car. So over all a very nice little car.<br><br>Now the trailer. Unlike the motor home, this trailer opens only on one side. It has the two seats inside with a small sleeping area in the front. Plenty of windows in this one also. Including with this one is the frying pan, two red cups and a pair of the hotdogs. The bicycle also clicks on the back of the trailer along with the flashlight. The side of the trailer closes and clicks closed with what I have always called the door handle piece, the one 1x2 flat with the ""L"" piece on the side. Also included is a sticker inside that is to be used as the TV. <br><br>The mini figures included in this is a male figure with a green sweater, slightly unshaven face and the mop style haircut. The female is wearing a blue shirt and has the blonde Marion hairstyle.<br><br>All said this one will look nice in front of the Log Cabin #5766 or paired up with the motor home #7639. So this is a pretty good purchase with a straight forward two part build, starting with the car and then the trailer. <br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Lint","2012-04-25T04:50:25.54Z","Nice Vehicular Additions","<p>This excellent camper set is a fantastic addition to any collection. While it is very similar to last year's camping RV I think it stands well on it's own merit.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Two Vehicles, yellow sedan and camper trailer look fantastic. Car can fit 2 persons!<br></li><li>Lots of nice parts: sausages, bike, pan, rubber wheels<br></li><li>Clever mechanism to help balance the camper when it is disconnected from the car<br></li><li>Stickers are tasteful and do not cross over brick seams</li><li>Couple of minifigs who look exactly like some good friends of mine.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Quite pricey in Australia at full RRP<br></li><li>Car and camper has no doors but it is becoming a LEGO standard.</li><li>There are similarly priced sets this year in the CITY line that may have better play value.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall there is not a lot wrong with this set. While the theme may seem a little boring to some, I can testify that the quality of this set and surprise playability will not dissapoint.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"erra","2020-10-17T03:32:37.137Z","Great theme with a lot of potencial playability potential but set full of wrong design decisions","<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">I am a Lego fan, now as an adult. And as an adult I also have a look beyond&nbsp; imagination as a Kid. I usually buy second hand sets and try to improve them. This 4435 has been my new candidate.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Lego has created its world around things that fly and&nbsp; things that roll. And this &quot;set&quot;, without any doubt, meets expectations. The fact that the set consists of a caravan pulled by a car takes advantage over Campervans or motorhomes (like 7639 as a few other reviewers previously mentioned).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">A caravan set theme decision&nbsp;allows to create countryside dioramas, which is uncommon in Lego designs. And that&rsquo;s a plus too. The campfire, the pan, the bicycle and the two minifigures perfectly accompany this purpose and I would say, moreover, that they are essential.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">But the beauty of the set, by its proposal, is not supported by design decisions, which handicap the possibilities of realistic&nbsp;and playable set: two of the standards that Lego has always tried to preserve.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">So, let&#39;s go for the design decisions that could have been better, both in the choice of colours, proportion&nbsp;and interior layouts:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">THE CAR</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">The first criticism is basic and widely discussed among Lego fans: The width of the car. It makes no sense to design 4 studs width cars. Real cars maintain a 2/5 width/length ratio. The car width of 14 studs should be 6 (2 for each of the seats side to side and 1 for each of the sides of the car). But as everyone knows,&nbsp;arms of the mini-figures prevent them from sitting side to side and therefore an extra stud is needed.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">About colour:&nbsp;Why yellow?!</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Do you often see yellow cars on road other than taxies? Is it not weird to see a taxi pulling a caravan?</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Lego cars should always have seats.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">The classic piece of the steering wheel is too low. Two standard&nbsp;high&nbsp;plates (2x1) to lift it would be&nbsp;needed.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">THE CARAVAN</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Aspects to talk about: 1. Number of wheels; 2. Door ; 3. Furniture and facilities layout; 4. Heigh 5. Hinged walls location</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">1.Why a pair of wheels on both sides of the caravan? And Why centred? I guess that lego designers were concern about making a caravan that would stand balanced when removed&nbsp;from the car. No need at all. The&nbsp;Caravan regards to its size is well-balanced when linked to the car and a support piece (intelligent way of use it) is provided to balance it&nbsp;when separate from the car. But Why is this so important? Because wheels &#39;sacrifice&#39;&nbsp;interior layout and the presence of a door.&nbsp; A caravan door should be mandatory: because of beauty and because of playability too.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">3. Interior layout is a real disaster, a tragedy. Why do seats are placed in the middle? Why did not&nbsp;designers place them besides one of the caravan walls above the first row of the pieces that make up the structure (for instance)? This way, when seats aside, mini-figures could stand up beside or a few furnitures could&nbsp;be&nbsp;set on the opposite&nbsp;wall.&nbsp;Why is table so bad finished? Has anybody know what kind of facilities are provided inside the caravan? Is a sink and a shower or a burner cooker and a worktop kitchen what the extra pieces try to look like?</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">My suggestion is an upside-down&nbsp;layout design:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Double bed in the rear room; table and seats sideways in the front; kitchen worktop and one burner cooker on one side; tile pieces with some stickers for microwaves or fridge ; the entry door&nbsp;where is now placed&nbsp;one of the two side wheels; toilet and sink in the opposite wall.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">4. One extra one high brick row in every wall is mandatory. Windows look low and mini-figures can not stand inside.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">5. Walls should be open through the main walls middle section : It would allow better global stability when walls fold out (as the wardrobe doors opening). Better, then,&nbsp;two small movable sections than just a bigger one.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Summary:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Is not a bad set at all. I would purchase it again with no doubt.&nbsp; Great theme decision. Kids would have fun by playing with it for sure. The set looks great but design is better solved on the outside than on the inside either the car and the caravan and playability, then, drops.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:10px"">Thanks for reading (Sorry for being nuisance, in case)</p>
