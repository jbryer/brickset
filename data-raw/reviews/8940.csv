	Since the City theme replaced World City in 2005, LEGO has produced a mid-priced series of nicely designed utility and construction vehicles. &nbsp;This set continues the tradition with a dump/tipper truck that offers an attractive color scheme with some interesting new parts. &nbsp;The license plate offers a clue that this set was designed by AFOL Pierre Normandin, the designer of the 10219 Maersk train.</p>
<p>
	The set features modular construction, with the first bag building the chassis, and the second building the cab and tipper bed. &nbsp;The first bag also includes two minifigs and a newly designed wheelbarrow. &nbsp;The wheelbarrow has has 2 studs in the bottom and is very stable when sitting on the wheel and two rear pegs. &nbsp;It has two rod handles that align well with the minifig hands. However, the fixed angle of the minifig wrists means the wheelbarrow is barely lifted off the ground.</p>
<p>
	Construction of the chassis is straightforward, and the assembly is solid. &nbsp;However, there are a few odd choices. &nbsp;First, the chassis is constructed from a seemingly random assortment of dark bley and tan plates that detracts from the continuity of the assembly. &nbsp;Second, there are identical accessory panels that are attached to either side of the truck behind the front wheels. &nbsp;In my opinion these panels should be built as mirror images rather than copies, so the two sides are symmetrical. &nbsp;Finally, the lower part of the cab has an annoying 1-stud gap on each side that creates an unfinished look.</p>
<p>
	The cab is built like many comparable sets, with a SNOT grille using the 2x6 plate with studs on top, and using the resurgent vehicle doors in orange. &nbsp;The cab holds two minifigs (assuming they can avoid tangling their arms), and includes the omnipresent coffee cup. &nbsp;The truck bed is built with new end and side panels. &nbsp;The end panels are like a thin wall panel with three sides closed in. &nbsp;The 4-wide side panels have a 3 stud wide base forming a 90-degree angle with the side. &nbsp;The panels are held together with tiles that are attached to the sides and base. &nbsp;The tiles create convolutions on the sides that improve the appearance of the truck. &nbsp;The included tiles don&rsquo;t cover all the studs in the bed, creating a rough surface that makes it hard to tip out the 1 x 1 round bricks included as a load. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The completed set looks great with only a few stickers used to enhance the appearance. &nbsp;Strangely, a 2 x&nbsp;4 orange tile is covered by a 2 x&nbsp;4 orange sticker, with CITY written in a tiny font in the center. &nbsp;Playability is good with the aforementioned bed tipping and opening tail gate and cab doors.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Very realistic looking with superb aesthetics</li>
	<li>
		Solid construction throughout</li>
	<li>
		Good&nbsp;playability</li>
	<li>
		New wheelbarrow part is a great new accessory</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Lack of tiles in the bed creates inconsistent tipping</li>
	<li>
		Strange color combination for the chassis construction</li>

"Duq","2012-02-09T20:02:47.363Z","LEGO City Truck of the year 2012","<p>LEGO City Council has a big new tipper truck and they picked well. It's a good looking truck that comes well equipped.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Nothing special about the box; a nice picture of the truck on the front and some action pictures on the back. Surprisingly for a set this size with a single model there are two numbered bags in the box. The instructions are surprisingly long; more than 50 pages for just over 200 pieces. Yes, it's aimed at 5 years and up but I still think instructions are too easy these days.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection is pretty good. There are some nice orange bits, doors, slopes and tiles. There are some hinges (including the new type 2x4 with a technic pin) and tiles and lots of dark grey round bricks as cargo. There's the new wheelbarrow which looks good but I think is too big for a minifig. There are also some detailing pieces like the exhausts and two pairs of binoculars, as well as a shovel and a sweeping brush.</p><p>Then there are those big new bracket pieces that make up the tipper bed. While they work well for this model I'm usually not a big fan of these big pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two men in this set. One with a black cap and a blue coat with orange safety stripes, the other with a red hard hat and blue dungaries.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building is straightforward and as mentioned above, with an average of 4 pieces added per page you really can't go wrong. Bag 1 builds the chassis, bag 2 builds the cab and tipper bed. As has been the norm for years some SNOT parts are used for the front of the truck and the rear bumper.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The truck overall looks very good. The cab is a typical European front steer, the V8 sticker suggesting it's a Scania. It's full of details; the step below the cab door is a nice touch as is the set of lights and horns on the roof. I especially like the elegant way the mirrors are done.</p><p>The tipper bed looks the part with the tiles giving the side a nice texture. The plate hinges work well for the door/flap at the back.</p><p>The chassis is very colourful; dark and light grey, tan, black and even blue and green. The various colours aren't obvious but they are visible. Just replacing the tan with grey would be an improvement.</p><p>Tipper trucks are always fun to play and with opening cab doors and the realistic flap at the back this one certainly delivers. And the wheelbarrow is a nice bonus.</p><p>There are a few stickers; the usual number plates and a few red/white stripes on the corners. A sticker covers the 2x4 tile on the front just to show a small 'City' and even smaller 'V8'.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A very playable model with the best looking cab in years, two minifigs and a wheelbarrow, and a nice mix of parts. My only problem with it really is all the colours in the chassis.</p><p>For all of this I paid â‚¬20, well worth the money.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"AETerry","2012-03-05T12:49:20.973Z","Dump Truck Review","<p>For a City set, this is good for filling out a set or collection. I've missed several Town/City Construction sets over the years due to budgets or level of interest. So in a year where I've filled out my Police and Fire Departments quite nicely, I'm looking at trying to fill out other areas and sub-themes of my LEGO City.</p><p>This is obviously a niche set and is only going to appeal to certain collectors. Primarily if you're looking to add more Construction type vehicles. Otherwise, this set can be skipped over.<br></p><p></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions of course are in booklet form with easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 222 pieces to this set, making it feel the price per piece at $19.99 is well worth the pick up of this set. Notable pieces are the white fence, the new style of wheel barrow. A piece I've not seen since the Fabuland sets of the 80's. And several orange pieces for the cabin of the Truck.</p><p>Love them or hate them, there are also stickers included in this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two construction worker minifigures included in this set. One with blue overalls and red hard hat. The other has a blue &amp; orange coveralls, wearing a black hat and has a grey bearded head. Both do the job well of filling out this set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The main build of this set is for the Dump Truck, built in modular format, focusing first on the back of the truck before moving to the Cabin.</p><p>The back part of the truck is done pretty good. You're able to tilt it up so you can dump out all of the cylinder/rock pieces for gravel.</p><p>The Cabin of the truck, I don't like to well. Mainly it's the front part where the glass piece is placed and when trying to place a minifigure inside, I've had the entire front of the truck cabin come apart on me. So it just doesn't seem very stable when trying to open or close it to place minifigures within it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As stated before, it's a rather niche set for those collecting any Town/City sets and wanting to fill out their Construction Sub-theme. The design isn't ultimately perfect, but it's still pretty good and you've got a good value should you decide to pick up this medium-sized set. Plus, if you're looking for where to get a newish accessory piece of a wheel barrow, this is a set to get it in. But if you're not collecting City or wanting construction sets, then this can be skipped over in favor of any other themes or more favorable sets.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"WallaceWallace","2012-07-04T18:43:20.973Z","Usefull realistic truck","<p>Just a quick pro-con review for a great truck:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pro</strong><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>brick-built chassis 
<li>doors in cabin 
<li>european style&nbsp; 
<li>&nbsp;good use of bricks,&nbsp;no ""oh please replace this big part by smaller ones"" (see note on truckbed special parts below) 
<li>fence, wheelbarrow, broom, shovel: nice fillers 
<li>a load of rocks 
<li>nice color scheme 
<li>2 rolling-shutter guide bricks hidden in chassis, always welcome 
<li>playable design, usefull for carying a lot of stuff 
<li>quality minifigs</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pro and/or con<br/></p></strong>
<ul>
<li>realism (My 5y old son enjoys great models, but is sometimes a bit sad when his builds aren't so realistic. On the other hand it's inspiring too of course, and TLG has many others that are ""simplier"".) 
<li>dumptruck special parts: they are great on the model and I could even imagine some other uses for them, but they stay special parts, you like it or not 
<li>following instructions leads to assymetrical side parts (where the broom is attached to), no problem but I changed it 
<li>some tan colored parts in the chassis make building easy, but don't help to the look </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong></p><strong></strong>
<ul>
<li>stickers on fence: I'm not a fan of stickers, but if that's what TLG has to do to cut costs, so be it. But then please don't start saving on the stickers. The crawler crane (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7632-1"">7632</a>)&nbsp;had a great full-width red-and-white sticker for the fence, while these look like City dept. ran out of paint. 
<li>sticker ""city v8"" on the fron... euh why? 
<li>very poor cutting quality of stickers (license plates really not symmetrical) 
<li>dumptruck bed: more black&nbsp;flat tiles would have been nice (indeed, you don't see it on the pictures) 
<li>instructions could be more accessible for kids with the creator-like mini brick-list per step, it could help for a kid to avoid missing a piece (yes, I had to backtrack once)</li></ul>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>Good value for money, got it for â‚¬18 (july 2012). Usual extra small pieces. Tear-open box.&nbsp;A 6-stud wide truck obviously won't fit 2 people side to side, but the worker is happy to be tossed in anyway ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong><br/>It's a great looking truck that fits nicely in many displays, and it's a great looking truck that allows good play. You can actually load a good pile of stuff into it, it's usefull! </p>
<p>Happy with it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Bram","2012-04-14T14:05:16.987Z","Another Lego truck? err..NOT!!","There's actually so much to review on this set, because it's that good in my opinion, but I'll try to keep it brief.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Out of the box and building impressions<br></span>The box is actually pretty compact, depicting an orange dump truck<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>with the new bed design (which what draws major interest on this set).Contains two numbered bags, which correspond with the building steps, a small sheet of sticker and an instruction booklet.<br><br>The build steps are actually very interesting, divided into three modular sections of the truck. Note I mentioned 'modular'. The first initial steps will leave you with a fully finished chassis. The designer 'PN' did a splendid job transforming a real truck into a six wide lego vehicle with an actual <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ladder chassis</span>. The first ever to my knowledge. Then we add the cabin and the bed. And yes being modular you CAN detach the cabin and bed very easily to expose the chassis without any major disassembly. This opens up HUGE MOC possibility should you decide to interchange the bed and cabin with your own design. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Coffee table impressions</span><br>I've always thought the best place to view a built Lego set is on a coffee table while sipping a hot espresso hence the title..hmm maybe that's just me being a coffee addict LOL. Now let's move on to the finished model, more to talk about here. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1.Truck</span>: Well at a glance it looks like another typical Lego Euro style cabover truck. Look closely you'll appreciate some fine detailings that went into it. The cab is one plate 'apart' from the main chassis,conveniently black in color. This serves to mimic the gap in suspended cabin found on many modern Euro cabovers The hollow one plate gap above the headlights further emphasizes this feature. On real trucks, the cabin is suspended to isolate engine and road vibrations. Just observe a real truck's cabin when going over rough terrain or speed bumps. The cabin 'moves' independently. The front is slabbed with 2x4 plate and sticker showing 'City' logo badge and discreet 'V8', a typical turbocharged diesel configuration found on many heavy duty Euro trucks such as Scania,MAN and Merc-Benz. Personally it looks like the 1st gen MB Actros.<br><br>The other highlight of this set is the dumptruck bed. The new panels are 'locked' into place to form a rigid structure by means of various tiles. These tiles also replicate the ribbed structuring found on dumptruck beds. Kudos to the designer for creating such functional aesthetics. Overall this newly designed bed has a nice realistic feel to it and will be the staple for future six wide truck bed. However one thing remains, the usual trucker's drinking cup..I guess Lego loves to promote their 'drinking and driving campaign'..thankfully not alcoholic in nature! However this cup and truck driver thing is getting old, I would like to see a newspaper or even a pet lizard or something. LOL<br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Minifigs</span>: The set includes two minifigs, a driver and a less fortunate worker who gets to do the dirty work pushing the wheelbarrow LOL. These minifigs are standard, no fancy printed stuff, therefore the plastics are noticably of higher quality than found on Chinese produced figs such as the minifigure series. The box also confirms, no chinese built components. Sadly that's what makes the figs rather 'boring' too.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Accessories : </span>A fence, the beautiful new wheelbarrow, a shovel and a broom and 25 pcs of extra 1x1 round brick for the load.<br><br>Pros: <br>- Innovative modular build and 'chassis'<br>- 2 minifigs<br>- Heap of accessories<br><br>Cons:<br>- Should've come with 250pcs of round bricks than 25pcs LOL<br>- Rather boring minifigs<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span> : A nice and innovatively built small set with realistic detailings&nbsp; Comes with two minifigs and heap of accessories to boot for instant playability .&nbsp; Reasonable price/parts ratio. 9.5/10<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"LCPTF8404","2012-06-04T20:29:12.61Z","Another Awesome Set!","The Lego City Tipper Truck or Dump Truck #4434, its the 2nd largest Great Vehicles set, after the Recycling Truck #4206. Though its 222 pieces, its actually 197 if you exclude the 25 cement pieces, making it smaller than the Ambulance #4431. But anyway, this is an awesome set. It has great accessories, great minifigs, and the awesome truck itself. <br><br>1. Accessories: The accessories in this set are a broom and shovel, which they can also stick on the truck, the new wheelbarrow piece, a warning fence, and 25 cement pieces The shovel and broom, as always, are used to clean up the cement pieces. The wheelbarrow is cool, its great how they put this in this set too. The warning fence is great too, its used to warn cars or citizens to stay back from construction. The accessories are great, they really fit this set. <br><br>2. Minifigures: The minifigs are great. There is a driver for the truck and a worker to lay out the cement. The driver has a black cap and a blue uniform. The worker has a construction hat, which makes him a real worker, and overalls with tools in the pockets. The minifgures are cool, they also fit this set as well. <br><br>3. Vehicle: The Truck is awesome, having 6 wheels, holders for the shovel and broom, and a tipping bed for the cement. This truck actually looks like a real modern dump truck, while the other Dump Truck #7631, looks like a real construction dump truck. The details which are the lights on its roof are awesome. And the big tipping bed or bucket is large enough to dump probably about 40-50 cement pieces which I find interesting. The whole truck itself is awesome, its one of my favorite vehicles in the Great Vehicles theme. <br><br>4. Summary: This set is my one of my favorite sets of Lego City for 2012. The price is $20, which is a fair price. You can also use this set for The Mine #4204, there's a green dump truck like this one, but a little bigger, so you can have 2 dump trucks for the mine. I recommend you get this set. Really, I do.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"sf1378","2012-09-21T16:55:41.49Z","GOOD PIECE OF LEGO THIS...","Sometimes I buy a Lego set to cheer myself up. Today I bought this one. I was tempted to buy the 4431 Ambulance set due to it having 3 mini figures and discounted to Â£11.19 at John Lewis but given I currently own 7 previous Ambulance / Red Cross Lego vehicles I really wanted something different.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Its a good build, intricate and lengthy - which is what Lego should be all about - taking ones mind off things in real life as you immerse yourself in the building process.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It reminds me of many dumper trucks I see speeding along up and down the main road near my house that are chock full of reclamation materials and dirt.

If so, do post photos....Overall a really nice set but I do feel the price point is still way too high for whats included - it should be around the Â£10 mark and the boxes should be reduced in size - its very wasteful of Lego compared to the packaging of the halcyon 1980s hence giving this review a 3 bricks out of 5 for value for money whereas the others got 5 bricks out of 5 in terms of:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall,</div><div>Building Experience,</div><div>Parts (5 out of 5 for the wheel barrow),</div><div>Playability (children will like it a lot).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"tfranklin84","2012-12-31T11:44:13.203Z","Perhaps the best set $20 can buy","<p>You know how sometimes, everything about a set just ""feels"" right? That was this set for me. When it comes to city vehicles, I basically only purchase a set if it would add something to my (in progress) Lego town. This dump truck does just that simply by being immediately recognizable, realistic, and attractive.&nbsp; I thought it was so neat, I decided to make this my first review. </p>
<p>While building the set, what stuck out to me most was just how solid and well thought out it all was. Every piece made sense. I especially liked the flat square tiles which attached to the side of the truck bed, and the smooth dumping (ahem) of the truck. The cab, simple as it might be, is probably what really sells this truck. The color, the shape, everything about it just looks right, moreso than just about any other $20 Lego truck I've seen. This truck will have a permanent place in every ""construction zone"" my Lego town ever has. </p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>very attractive, realistic truck 
<li>fun (and over too soon) build 
<li>a red wheelbarrow 
<li>price feels very fair 
<li>Once it's built, it just looks and feels so...solid. </li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmmm, none for this price range. Even the stickers aren't too bad. </li></ul>
<p>Overall: I see no reason not to get this set if you have any interest in small lego trucks whatsoever. For city building, or as a stand alone set, there is nothing I would change about it.&nbsp;Simple and inexpensive as it is, I believe&nbsp;this is one little truck which will never go out of style. </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
