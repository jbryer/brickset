It has a good variety of parts and other than the car bodies and faces there are very few that make you say ""I'll never be able to make anything else with this"" -- it is nearly all standard bricks, and there are some nice little details like you'd find on sets for older kids. It's also not too Cars-y -- just take away the vehicles and the face from the crane and this could be a standard City set.<div><br></div><div>If you or your kid like to build, there's lots here to make (with no monotonous repetition) and if you like playing, there's lots to do: two cranes, the whole thing opens and closes, and more. Also, they use tiles and jumpers to make it easy to rearrange what's on the platform.&nbsp;The only downside is that this type of construction makes the whole thing a bit fragile, but I think it's a good trade-off. You can always use a couple standard pieces (or take the smooth ones off) if you want it to be sturdier.<div><br></div><div>Being a licensed set it's a little on the wrong side of the magical 10-cents-per-piece threshold but not by too much. Also, I've already seen it on clearance for as little as US$35. If you have a youngster that might someday like this, I'd say jump on it now and put it away somewhere -- it's bound to go up quite a bit on Amazon/eBay once it's discontinued. Since it has so few non-reusable pieces I'm still giving it five stars for 'value'.</div><div><br></div><div>Random notes: This does not come with wheels for Finn, but they are of course easy enough to add if you have any. It has quite a few stickers, which I'm not a fan of, but all the faces are printed on so you don't need to apply any if you don't want to. My one suggestion is to alter the build order and make the winch/helipad assembly after the platform is ready.</div></div><div><br></div><div>This set comes with 3 small instruction books and one medium one.</div><div>1: Small: Finn McMissile and Professor Z (bag 1)</div><div>2: Small: Grem and the helipad (bag 2)</div><div>3: Small: Crane and green container (bag 3)</div><div>4: Medium: Platform and structures (bags 4 &amp; 5)</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
