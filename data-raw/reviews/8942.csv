Both cars move well and are built sturdily, but it would have been nicer with some other objects in the background area of this set, such as something life a stoplight like the one from set 9481, Jeff Gorvette. Honestly, the only reason I'd get this set is because:<br><br>A. You're a big fan of Cars<br>B. You want the cars because they aren't in any other set<br>C. You want to complete your collection of the original vehicles from cars, the V8 station w/all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of its good ol' vehicles, and ""Red"" would finish that collection nicely.<br><br>In summary, buy this set if you feel like you really need it in your collection, or if it's on sale somewhere. Ex. Toys R Us'&nbsp; (Buy $50 of lego sets get $10 off), like I did.<br>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The boxes for CARS sets are fairly standard, they are a red coloured box with images of the set in dynamic action poses on the front and the back usually showcases the features of the set. The instructions share the images and colouring of the boxes from the front, while the interior shows each step-by-step method of building the existing models. Not much more to say about them than that really.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Unfortunately there aren't a lot of unique parts in this set, suffice it to say there are quite a number of great coloured parts in the set, from Acer's green coloured pieces to Red's abundance of red pieces. This set isn't much in the way of unique parts, but the colors are rich and vibrant and useful for MOCing.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>CARS sets themselves do not feature Mini-Figures, instead the models of the CARS are the Mini-Figures of the CARS Theme (so to speak), this is the only set to feature Red the fire engine from Radiator Springs. It also features Acer one of the Lemons from CARS 2, this is not the only set to feature Acer, but it is the only version of Acer with the small acetelene torch and goggles 'accessories' added on to the model. Both are worth picking up.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There are two numbered bags in this set, the first bag has you building Acer, a fun little build with some wonderful looking colours, the character rolls quite nicely and the acetelene torch and protective eyewear accessories are really impressive. The way LEGO captured this aspect of the film was done brilliantly.</p>
<p>Bag 1 also has the initial steps for Red, while Bag 2 has you finishing off Red. Out of the two Red is really a gorgeous looking model, he has stickers for detail work such as his Radiator Springs Fire Department logos and his build is just all around reminiscent of the old-school LEGOLAND Town Fire Trucks of yesteryear. Perhaps that's why I love this set so much, the nostalgia factor of the familiar and easy to follow build steps. Either way I'm pretty impressed with Red as a finished model goes.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is an excellent set to track down for fans of LEGO CARS, it is the only way to own Red to complete the Radiator Springs Cast, and it features a neat looking Acer with acetelene torch and those goggles are just cleverly built. Mind you at the regular retail asking price of 25$ CND there isn't much more to offer besides the two nifty looking vehicles.</p>
<p>I found it last month at Real Canadian Superstore for the low, low asking price of 12.44$, it was something I just could not pass up. The addition of Flick-Fire Water Missiles on Red adds a bit of play value to the set, but honestly I think LEGO could have at least added another car to the set, or perhaps some bit of roadway on a new smaller sized plate with a street corner build or something to justify the low piece count and lack of Mini-Figures. Recommended on sale, and for big fans of the LEGO CARS Theme.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
