The details, the figures, everything, is just AMAZING! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>The new rockets on Mater are a HUGE improvement. The old ones weren't very movie-accurate, so LEGO has really upped the ante on this set. </li><li>Mater's eyes. The new determined look could be of a great use in a Cars 2 brickfilm. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong></p><ul><li>Mater's machine guns are still the same. LEGO really didn't have the time to make a new minigun piece? If there was one, it would've been AWESOME on Mater and maybe in military&nbsp;MOCs. </li><li>Petrov Trunkov. Tsk tsk. The&nbsp;biggest disappointment of the whole set. Seriously? A character that was kicked out of the film? Why, LEGO, just why? </li><li>The fact that guns are replaced by flick missiles. Just because nothing launches or shoots doesn't mean the set has no play value. I REALLY would've enjoyed seeing a machine gun on Petrov instead of flick missiles. Big mishap on LEGO's part. x-( </li><li>The parachute. It's PLASTIC PAPER. I was expecting a cloth piece like LEGO used in sets like the Harry Potter Gryffindor Common Room. </li><li>The camera being a tripod, and the fact that it was NEVER in that scene in the movie. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I thought it was a very nice set. Great detail, lots and lots of play value, and, despite the fact that there are plenty of cons, the set is still pretty worth it. This is my fave set in the Cars 2 line so far and I think everyone else should see how awesome this set is. :) </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SKip-E-Productions2, signing off!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-08T12:56:49.307Z","Fleeing from Evil","<p>Set #9483 Agent Mater's Escape: Representing a scene from Cars 2, a scene which I've plumb forgot having not seen the film in a while, this small 18$ set might not have much to offer at first glance, however I find it quite charming.</p>
<p>The set features two numbered bags, one instruction book and 144 pieces some of them the new single pieces used for the Cars Characters details and such. Like with all Cars related sets I find myself drawn to the collectibility of the Cars themselves, similar to how Disney has created small Hot Wheels style Cars toys the LEGO brand has managed to create a high collectiblity and fun factor with these sets.</p>
<p>Most Cars sets are vanishing at Retail faster than you'd care to admit, I'm certain you'll still have a bit of luck tracking this down. Now on to the models! Bag number 1 includes all of the pieces used to build Mater or Agent Mater, he's built pretty much the standard way all versions of Mater are built, using primarily dark brown pieces. This version includes the rocket engines he used in the film and some extra clips for holding weapons and the 'parachute' which is a single thin plastic strip of material in a mixture of dark orange colors with detailed print details. He includes the usual printing details, the sign Tow Mater on either side, his eyes, mouth and bumper, the tow hook is even included though with the rocket engines attached its functionality is hindered. The engines can be removed, however this doesn't solve too much of the playability with the tow hook as it is still in an awkward position in order to make room for the engines. Still LEGO could have just left the tow hook off entirely and it wouldn't have affected the look of the model too much, so including it here is quite welcome. Agent Mater's parachute isn't much really, though it does serve as a design element that harkens to the film, and he's holding two of those tommy guns as he makes his escape.</p>
<p>Bag #2 includes all of the parts to build two elements, the first is Petrov Trunkov, a character meant to appear in the film who for whatever reason failed to make any significant screen time. Or indeed any, this isn't a bad thing really, it means you get to have another unique Cars character instead of just packaging in another duplicate of one we already saw, so it's nice that both characters are unique to this set. (Even if Mater has appeared in many different sets, this version is indeed unique to this set.) Petrov here includes a flick-fire missile for added play, easily to remove if you'd prefer. The other element built from bag 2 is the sinister destructive weapon used by the Lemons in the film to ignite the Alinol and cause devastation for the racers at the World Grand Prix. (It even has a printed tile piece that says World Grand Prix on it.) Now this model might seem out of place, as it doesn't appear in the actual scene from the film being depicted here, to be fair to LEGO however I'm not sure how many other sets even include this 'weapon' and some collectors might not be able to afford or even find the larger sets, so this is a nice inclusion to the set.</p>
<p>Overall this is a pretty fun little set, right now I picked it up from RCSS (Real Canadian Superstore) for the low, low price of 8.94$, a great bargain if your store still has it in stock for that price. You get two Cars to play with, piting Agent Mater against the evil Petrov Trunkov, so there is a level of playability here. Petrov is also using a lot of sweet new colored parts in a sort of pea green tone, and Mater's rockets are fun to build and the parts can be used for any other MOCs you might want to. The parachute isn't very useful for MOCing I'll admit, but this set is great fun and worthy of looking into. As the Cars themselves in LEGO form are really the big selling point and very fun to play with.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
