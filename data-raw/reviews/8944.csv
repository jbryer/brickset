<p>I think you should get him, especially if you have another Finn from other sets so you can put more gadgets on him.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<p>Finn McMissile is one of the main characters in Cars 2, I didn't much care too much for the film to be honest, I felt it was one of the weaker Pixar offerings. That being said I still found myself drawn to the LEGO Theme, and it does not dissapoint. Finn here is fun to just roll around and he's got some nice printing on him that is different from many of the other versions out there. He also features a flick-fire missile, a radar dish for communications and a sub-machine gun first seen in LEGO Batman sets of 2006.</p>
<p>The model uses all of the parts perfectly to replicate the look of the character, and there are a few extra pieces to make Finn look different, you can have two of the same 1x1 stud piece on the front of the car if you prefer instead of one of each. The colors of the pieces in this set are really stand out too, this is the first time we've seen such light baby blue coloring from LEGO. MOCers will go ape over it. Overall I'm going to say this model is a wonderful looking set and well worth the asking price of 10$ in Canada, at this time of the year though you may want to try to grab a few for parts packs on sale. Or as stocking stuffers. Oh yes and before I forget, I love this new wheel piece LEGO has introduced. It's much different from the older City stuff.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
