Jeff Gorvette is one of the racers in the World Grand Prix from Cars 2, I think his name and personality are a play on an actual racer in our world. Can't be sure.</p>
<p>Gorvette here uses a similar build to most of the Cars themselves who share body types. The thing is, he's got a nice canary yellow with most of his pieces. Which is a nice change of pace from all the red you'll have by collecting a lot of the Cars sets and getting more and more Lightning McQueens. It's one of the main reasons I really wanted to get this set, the unique color of the Cars character and the pieces included with the set were a great must have item. He has printing on two plates that fit on the side which indicate where he hails from, the USA. (Plus the number 24.)</p>
<p>Like Francesco, Gorvette includes two additional elements, again the red and white strip of railway, or position marker for the starter line, and a small light with red and green. To start the race, it sits on a medium stone gray 2x2 brick.</p>
<p>I really like Gorvette, the printing on the parts makes for some interesting elements, he has the new hubcap/tire pieces in flat gray instead of silver like on McMissile and he has the spoiler on the back with World Grand Prix printed on it. Overall he's a fun little set and goes great with Francesco to set up a quick race for the kids. Toss in the Tokyo Raceway set and a few more cars and you can have loads of fun. I strongly reccomend this set especially due to that nice canary yellow.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
