However the sets are great if you can get them on sale.</p>
<p>Francesco here is based on a Formula 1 design, using some nice new pieces as well as familiar ones, there's a bit of printing on him for the face and such, as well as his bumper which says Ciao McQueen. He's got red hubcaps too, which strengthens my feelings of nostalgia as a lot of older Town sets had red wheels. Francesco is red, white and green the Italian flag's colors.</p>
<p>Francesco includes two additional elements, more than likely because even for 49 pieces there aren't many used in the car build. You get a flag on a stand, I think this is meant to be Francesco's race flag. It's an interesting set piece, and gives you something else besides just the car model in the set unlike Ivan Mater and Finn McMissile. There's also a small plate with red and white tiles attached, possibly part of the railing on the side of the raceway, or perhaps a marker for Francesco's position at the starting line.</p>
<p>Overall I'm really impressed by the new single pieces on the Cars models, and these sets allow you to collect the Cars without having to pay so much for the more expensive sets. They are priced a little on the higher side, however they do feature more unique pieces than most small impulse sets. Or sets for buying with an allowance. The Cars are also quite fun and roll very well. If you're interested in collecting all of the Cars themselves with all unique printing styles you'll also need to pick up these little sets. I reccomend these sets and they make great stocking stuffers too for young Cars fans.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
