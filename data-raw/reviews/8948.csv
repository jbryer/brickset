<p>Right off the bat I will say this, if you live in Canada and have been avoiding this set because you are not too thrilled with the price-per-piece ratio, you'd best try to get down to your nearest Real Canadian Superstore and snap it up before they're all gone for the holidays. RCSS has marked them down from 9.99$ to 7.97$</p>
<p>The Cars Theme is not meant to be scaled with Mini-Figs, in fact LEGO even included a checklist in the back of the instructions to show you all the different Cars you can collect, and if you're a fan of Disney/Pixar's Cars Franchise you're going to love these little buildable versions of your favorite characters. The Cars are the Mini-Figs for these sets and they are addictive little suckers, just today I picked up Ivan Mater here and Jeff Gorvette and I already have plans to track down some more of these wonderful sets to add more great Cars Characters to my collection.</p>
<p>The model is quite quick and easy to build, the pieces mostly come in standard colors, however there are a lot of Blue colored pieces here. And at least four of them have printing on them, no stickers for the Cars, only printed pieces. Which may explain the price increase for these impulse level sets. At 52 pieces the MSRP of 9.99$ might be a tad high to your liking. The tow hook is fully functional and uses technic pieces in its construction.</p>
<p>Overall I find the model fun to play with and well worth the asking price I got it for, while it is true that many fans of LEGO might prefer traditional Mini-Fig style sets, the Cars fans will get a lot of mileage out of the LEGO Cars sets. Unfortunately the Theme ended before we could get a proper Ivan to sit next to Ivan Mater here, who is obviously Mater in his disguise. The fact that his eye print is the familiar Mater looking eyes, and he's got two large wheels and two smaller wheels makes it pretty obvious he's Mater and not really a good stand in for the actual Ivan. Still the color of blue used is very sharp and stands out quite nicely. I really recommend this set to the Cars fans who enjoy building and racing with LEGO not just tossing around the hot wheels styled Cars figures also available from Disney.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
