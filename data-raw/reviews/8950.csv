A meagre 87 pieces pieces did not really satisfy me.They should have included a pit stop with an engineer with tools or something to crush or break through.Overall I did not really like the parts included.</div><div><br></div><div>Playability : Oh man,this thing is really fun to play with ESPECIALLY if you have another monster truck from this series.The most fun part is of course the EJECTION,crash it into a wall and Crunch just flys out. Plus,it looks GREAT when it is crushing all my LEGO POLICE STUFF.</div><div><br></div><div>Value for money : Not that cheap but yet not too expensive,if it is at this price,it should have included what I mentioned earlier.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall :This is fun set, just wished it had more parts.</div><div><br></div><div>This has been Andrew0893 speeding of in my BONE CRUNCHER.</div>",TRUE,5,2,4,5,4
