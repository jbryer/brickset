This is my first Racers set in seven years (well, one of two).<br><br>I first noticed these four sets in a LEGO catalog at the start of the year, and after two and a bit months, I finally found two sets (this and 9092) at my local Sainsbury's - lucky find!<br><p>On with the review, then! The Nitro Predator is, as you'd guess from its name, is a beast!&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros</h4><p>The building is simple and fun. TECHNIC pegs, struts and 1x8 bricks make up the basic undercarriage, and it's easy to do. The real fun, though, comes with making up the body of the truck: handles, arching mudguards and a massive engine block - wow. You get some rare if not unique parts, too!</p><p>The crash and eject function works really well, too! It's brilliant to see a hyped LEGO gimmick live up to the adverts.<br></p><p>One thing that really makes these monster truck sets special is the minifigures. These are the first Racers sets in little under a DECADE to include characters, and the driver today is one Nitro Nick! Nick is, with the exception of the legs, made up of entirely new pieces, including a neat double-sided head with normal and dismayed expressions.</p><p>It's a pretty small set, so the price is great. Â£7.99 is money well worth parting with for this vehicle!</p><h4>Cons<br></h4><p>Cons... okay, not much to speak of here. There's no motor or anything... sigh. If I really had to clutch at straws, I'd point out that the bumper can wobble a bit.</p><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Great vehicle</li><li>Nitro Nick is a cool figure</li><li>Fun to build, but easy at the same time</li><li>Big chunky wheels</li><li>Great pieces</li><li>Value for money - really!<br></li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>Bumper can wobble and move out of position sometimes</li><li>No motor or other means of propulsion</li></ul><h4>The Last Words<br></h4><p>Well, there you have it! A great set. If you're looking to get into Racers, or just want a set without too much effort involved, then this is your thing!</p><p><br></p><p>- maaboo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
