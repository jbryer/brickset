<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>If you don't have the original mask, good.</li><li>Cool handcuffs.</li><li>Printed torso!</li><li>Sleek ball-shooter.</li><li>Cool proppellers.</li><li>Coulor scheme: Red, silver, white.</li><li>Cool Tubes.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>If you do have the original mask, bad.</li><li>How is he going to attach those handcuffs to a shark?</li><li>A hand could fit into the ball shooter, but they used a bionicle hand instead.</li><li>The propellers seriously hinder head movement.</li><li>Why the white parts?</li><li>Back STILL unarmoured.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, an allright set. if it's on sale, and you can get it cheap, like I did, do it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>no melee weapon</li><li>stupid colour scheme</li><li>a spear and 2 robot hands on a gun as a ""special weapon""</li><li>bad value for money</li><li>stupid oversised fans on shoulders</li></ul>
<p>in conclusion i strongly advise you to NOT BUY THIS SET</p><p>and to use your money for a set like bulk or core hunter or voltix.</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,1,2

"Curt1234","2020-07-09T07:36:23.027Z","A decent set.","<p>This set came in the mail recently. I&#39;m impressed. Cue the pros and cons!<br />
<br />
Pros to buying this set:<br />
<br />
&mdash; Nice parts.<br />
<br />
This set has really nice parts, like the fans and&nbsp;hoses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons to buying this set:<br />
<br />
&mdash; Poor playability.<br />
<br />
This set has very poor playability. The head can hardly move due to the fan apparatuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set overall is nice, but it is hard to play with... It&#39;s very good for Mocs, however.</p>
