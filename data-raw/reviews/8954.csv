"FowlerBricks","2017-03-14T18:48:49.273Z","Rocka, the golden Hero","<p>This is my first Hero Factory review, so I&rsquo;ll try to make it as interesting as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nyb2lzs5v/Rocka1.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>HISTORY: Rocka was created shortly after The Ordeal Of Fire and the 2.0 Upgrade.&nbsp;He was</p>

<p>modeled after Furno. While you got a brief glimpse of Rocka&rsquo;s 2.0 armor, he was never</p>

<p>available for purchase that way. Following the Savage Planet/3.0 episode Rocka was</p>

<p>upgraded to 4.0 and sent to apprehend the electrical villain Voltix. He succeeded quickly, but</p>

<p>Voltix had allowed himself to get captured. Once inside the prison, he triggered a mass</p>

<p>breakout using Von Nebula&rsquo;s Black Hole staff. All the Heroes were Upgraded to 4.0 &nbsp;and sent</p>

<p>after specific villains, but Rocka secretly stayed behind, suspecting that the breakout was</p>

<p>more than just a breakout. He was correct. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say for now. If you want</p>

<p>more information, look up Hero Factory breakout on You-Tube or get the Face Off guidebook.</p>

<p>On to the review!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>Gold 2x4 armor plates, gold 2x2 armor plates, whatever those gray armor pieces are called,</p>

<p>awesome Hex Shield, ammo belt and more. A nice selection. And, oh yeah, Hero Cuffs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/b0j7ce98z/Energy_Shield.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 225px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/f89e7elar/Energy_Shield_Attach.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 225px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Hero Factory. Not much to say. Simple and quick.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p>Rocka is an outstanding figure when he&rsquo;s completed. He stands almost a head taller than</p>

<p>normal Hero. His energy crossbow is a very intimidating weapon and his Hex Shield is one of</p>

<p>my favorite Hero Factory pieces.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nchic57pv/Crossbow.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Another cool thing about Rocka is that his back isn&rsquo;t totally bare. He has a silver foot that is</p>

<p>attached by two technic pins. This makes a very effective ammo pack.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/44yytaes3/Rocka2.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/94wf18ker/Rocka3.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Rock also has one&nbsp;silver hand (the other being the giant gun) and I&rsquo;ve heard some</p>

<p>people complain about that, since it&rsquo;s not gold. While in the mini movie, his hand is gold, I</p>

<p>think the silver hand in the set looks better. It gives him more detail. If you buy Rocka new, in</p>

<p>the back of the instructions it&rsquo;ll suggest that you mix Black Phantom (Rocka&rsquo;s 4.0 nemesis)</p>

<p>and Rocka. Don&rsquo;t. The mix looks really really (no offense Lego) stupid. the only complaints a</p>

<p>have about Rocka is: #1: the spear on top of the crossbow makes it hard to shoot the energy</p>

<p>bolt. #2: the length of Rocka&rsquo;s legs makes them slightly floppy, but that can&rsquo;t really be helped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>I think that Rocka is a stellar figure and he&rsquo;s very much worth getting. He has tons of</p>

<p>poseability, cool pieces and lots of overall awesomeness. The 4.0 wave was, in my opinion,</p>

<p>the best wave of them all. We got to see what Rocka, Nex and Evo&rsquo;s 1.0 masks would have</p>

<p>looked like, plus most of the Heroes and villains had good solid builds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: cool pieces</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lots of poseability&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;awesome mask mold</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;printed chest plate</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hero Cuffs&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: hard to shoot the crossbow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So there you have it, my first Hero Factory review. No offense everyone, but the reviews in</p>

<p>the Hero Factory department are somewhat lacking. I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t do something about it.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! It&rsquo;ll be either Nex 4.0 or Stormer 5.0 next. Zeebricks out! Go buy Rocka! He&rsquo;s</p>

<p>worth it!</p>
