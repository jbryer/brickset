"Kalhiki","2012-01-02T20:29:18.53Z","Better than expected","<p>After hearing all the negative reactions to this&nbsp;set, I wasn't sure how I'd end up liking him. But, to my surprise, Surge is turning out to be one of my favorite Breakout figures.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>No box. It's a bag. Yes, LEGO has gotten rid of canisters for this new style. Personally, I like it. It provides easy storage instead of that big, clunky canister that can't be compressed. This, however, can be flattened, bent, and twisted to fit into almost any area. This is also the smaller version of the package, so that makes it better.</p>
<p>Of course, the packaging features Surge in his glory flying through space along with an ad for the new Breakout game where you can get 200 game points from this set (more on that later). The back shows some of the features this set includes.</p>
<p>To open the new packaging, you have to cut along the top, then open a zip-lock style opening (which means it's resealable). The instuctions inside are basic. Not much to go over, however the back features a combiner model with his nemesis, Splitface. Not the best combiner, but oh well. Also, it seems the instructions are placed in the package with care, so no need to worry about wrinkles and bends.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Parts I rated a four, because he just doesn't come with many interesting parts (unless you like lime).&nbsp;As for parts he <em>does </em>have, he has is old Lightning Sword Shooter thing now in blue instead of yellow, and I must say it does look pretty good. Not only does he have his old weapon, but he has his old helmet. Nothing's been changed, but it's worth mentioning (this means he also uses the Glatorian head, which sadly has not been remolded with the new sockets). </p>
<p>The new chest piece is also pretty cool, and a Hero chest armor&nbsp;piece can also fit onto it.&nbsp;It also has some nice&nbsp;lightning printing on it. The fact that it's printed may make people happy because no stickers, but MoCists will be pretty upset since it'll be hard to&nbsp;MoC with.&nbsp;While focusing on the chest, he also has a new Hero Core. This time, all Cores are white, which I don't fully mind. Also, on the Core's back has the code to retrieve your 200 game points.</p>
<p>Now for my favorite piece, the gun. I love it. It's very high-tech, and a good break from the Thornax Launcher. Speaking of which the underside is a remolded version of said launcher, now shorter with the exclusion of the pin hole.</p>
<p>Also forgot to mention the cuffs. Cool piece, but not much to go over. You can cuff characters, and it's also cool that it uses the old chain links from Hewkii Mahri.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was your average Hero build. There wasn't much special here except for the lack of connecting a chest armor piece to the body. The gun wasn't all that interesting either since you just attach the pieces together in a non-special way. So, not much there, overall. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Let me just get something out of the way; those silver pieces on the shoulders&nbsp;look ridiculous. I flipped them around on mine, and it looks much better. I also moved the tube attachment point up higher on the back, two studs above the middle ball joint.</p>
<p>Ah, much better. Surge isn't anything all that special. He's your basic Hero, but I do like the parts usage. For instance, the legs. The cladding on the lower legs, to me, somewhat reminds of the 1.0-style ankle guards, and I like that. Especially since that was one of my favorite aspects of the 1.0 design. In addition to that, he also has a pretty bulky design (especially with the shoulder things flipped around). </p>
<p>Now, some complaints (not mine, other people's). I've heard a lot of negativity toward the colors with the over-abundance of lime green. Personally, I don't mind it too much, and the arms would be the only place to complain about it. But, I feel the gun covers enough green, and the blue on the sword breaks it up on the other arm. Overall, not to bad.</p>
<p>What I will complain about are the handcuffs. They dangle way too far down, and hit the floor (also, you get an extra chain link, so don't make it longer than needed). You can rotate the clip it's on, but still, it seems too big.</p>
<p>All in all, the figure is nice and very fun to play with and pose. The fun can be doubled if you have Splitface for him to battle. But if you don't, that's fine. He can battle the house cat or something.</p>
<p>He also looks good on display.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I like him. I was skeptical with the pictures, but now that I have him in hand, he's much better than expected. The build <em>was</em> just a basic Hero, but that's fine, since it's the figure you probably want. And, I think the figure is great. Some don't like the colors, but they're better in person, and easy to get used to. And my only true complaint about the handcuffs is easy to fix by just removing them.</p>
<p>So, do I recommend him? Yes, I do, with a score of 4.5/5</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

Guess its time for another upgrade.<br><br>BUILD: Surge is pretty nicely designed and is the most heavily armored version of him yet. The armor placement was good, the weapons are good, and those hero cuffs rock! The only complaint I have is the colors. Whats with the green?<br><br>PIECES: If you don't have Breez figure, the pieces are great! Surge's recolored lighting weapon is sick awesome! The new core is fine, and the cuffs rock! (Nice to see the old helmet back too)<br><br>OVERALL: Surge is a good buy. The only real complaints I have about him are the colors and the fact that, that lightning sword is way too sword.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Carnistir","2012-02-28T13:02:50.483Z","Prepare to be shocked.  Seriously.","<p>Title says it all.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; But really, he's cool.&nbsp; Onto the review.</p>
<h4>Bag/Instructions</h4><p>This thing is contained in a bag.&nbsp; It's okay, but I really like the canisters.&nbsp; I build buildings&nbsp;&nbsp; with my canisters.&nbsp; Really, it's fun.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; The instructions were not badly bent, so I'm happy.&nbsp; 8/10</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The armor is nice, but not really new.&nbsp; The armor, with the exception of the chest piece, is all old.   They used the original helmet, and the skeleton is nothing new, either.  The Lightning&nbsp;sword is just a re-color, but it looks sool, so whatever.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; The last&nbsp;item is the Ball shooter, which is very good.&nbsp; I'll get to that later.&nbsp; 9/10</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Easy.&nbsp; It's very simple, your average six-year-old could build it.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; :P 10/10</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The arms and legs are fairly bulky-looking, but the chest is rather thin...&nbsp; The Ball shooter is great.&nbsp; DO NOT AIM AT OTHER PEOPLE, IT CAN HURT.&nbsp; (Only a little, but just warning you.) 9/10</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's great, buy it.&nbsp; 'Nuff said.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>~DX ninja</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,4

"Curt1234","2020-08-26T22:19:54.29Z","An impressive set.","<p>Surge came in the mail recently, I&#39;m impressed. Let&#39;s list the pros and cons.</p>

<p><br />
Pros to buying this set:<br />
<br />
Good Parts.This set features parts like the silicon tube and the printed chest plate.<br />
<br />
Amazing playability and posability. You can move his limbs&nbsp;in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
Cons to buying this set:<br />
<br />
No coverage from the back. (Unless you include the wire as coverage, but I don&#39;t.)&nbsp;They could&#39;ve easily put a foot on the back to fix this, but they didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Overall, an impressive set. The designers at Lego weren&#39;t trying to make him some grand Hero with amazing weapons or anything like that. He just feels like a normal Hero.</p>
