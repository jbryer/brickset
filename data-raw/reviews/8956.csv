"Shunji_Sato","2012-03-16T12:01:46.65Z","A decent set.","<p>Hello again everyone, Today I purchased ""Evo"" My first Hero Factory set and my first Technic set in a long long time. I was looking for a dino set but they were out of stock so I settled for this. I think my last purchase was a Bionicle set, Maxilos and Spinax. (Which is a must have set) But we're here to talk about Evo. Awesome design, the best looking out of the current 9 dollar (Including tax!) line of Hero Factory figures. (In my opinion) The poseability is fantastic and colors are great too. Now lets move on to the pros and cons...</p>
<h4>Pros<br><br></h4><div>1: The Handcuffs included will make a fun accessory for the kids who own several hero factory figures.</div><div>2: As I stated before, The design is pretty cool. This guy looks awesome, and even better in person.</div><div>3: The price actually fits the sets' worth.</div><div>4: The little code on the back of the (H) part is for the online game which is a cool plus.</div><div>5: The instructions are fairly simple, the kids should be able to build this one themselves.</div><div>6: I think the bag is a good thing, It reduces the price of producing the figures I'm sure.</div>
<h4>Cons<br><br></h4><div>1: Absolutely no extra parts. I read the instructions and it said 1x 4285938 but I ended up with two in the bag somehow. But other than that no extra parts, not even an extra red ball. If you lose a part while building you're out of luck because some of the parts are exclusive to the set, and others you'll have to deconstruct a fellow hero factory figure to get another.</div><div>2: And the one 4285938 that does come with the set, sticks in the side of the arm and looks ugly and as far as I know has no purpose, even the official images show the figure without it.</div><div>3: While the gun on his arm is cool, the part that holds the bullet is very limited in mobility.</div><div>4: Children might have a hard time firing the bullet, you have to squeeze fairly hard to shoot it, and when it shoots it flies, and as I stated above you only get one with the set.<br>5: The parts aren't all that useful unless you're very skilled at building, or are building a hero factory character or bionicle figure, and even then it might be a tad difficult.</div><div>6: The chest plate moves, which is slightly annoying.</div><div>7: The back is quite bare.<br><br>I must say I'm a tad disappointed with this but at the same time I enjoy it. I had planned on buying a dino set so that kind of adds to the disappointment but either way it's a decent set and I'm glad I picked it up.</div>",TRUE,3,1,3,5,4

<p>Beginning the Breakout wave of Hero Factory, Evo is one of the greatest characters for this line. The set begins with a reusable and re-seable&nbsp;bag in order to put away your legos. This set has 36 pieces and a total of&nbsp;19 pages,</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The head, helmet, armor, and handcuffs are the new parts, some were re-used in previous Hero Factory sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nope, definitely no minfigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took 15 minutes to build the item, not bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set has something different, something new, and a bit same. The set has good build of handcuff pieces, great tank arm, and the whole character is great. There is a ball shooter for the set which is good. Although its does not a great set, still worth it!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Much better than Evo 2.0, although the purple was interesting. The helmet, the glatorian head, the armor were the best! The head color was much different compared to the previous heroes from the beginning wave of the set. The helmet looks fabulous, and&nbsp;the armor is totally&nbsp;great. The tank arm was very good, the place to put the cuffs was alright, and the price is decent. Well done with this Evo, looks like its a better upgrade.</p>

<h3>Bag/Instructions</h3>

<p>The bag depicts Evo running through the jungle, while the yellow catches your eyes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty awesome, you get lots of yellow, so if you want to make a yellow MOC, this will be a great set.</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<p>The accessories include &quot;Hero Cuffs&quot; and a &quot;Hero Blaster&quot;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a pretty generic HF build, make the arms and legs, click to the body, put the head on, ect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic, one of the best, most iconic and popular Hero Factory figures to date, it is awesome!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For a Hero Factory fan, this is a Must-Buy if you can still find it...</p>
