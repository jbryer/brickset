<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Unlike his other wave mates, Black Phantom comes in a cardboard box. For this size of set, I prefer it, since one of those bags would be ridiculously large. The front features BP being menacing aiming his buggy-eyed gun at you. The back is particularly nice not only featuring his play features, but also the other sets in the wave.</p>
<p>The instructions are easy to follow as usual; however, the white outline around the black parts is kind of an eyesore especially with a dominantly black figure. I get it that this makes the parts easier to see, but I think maybe a light grey would look better. Near the back of the instructions, there's also a picture of the spider-like combiner you can make with him and Rocka.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts are very nice, and&nbsp;I do like the glossy black pieces.</p>
<p>As for new pieces, you get his head which is a very nice mold and looks very menacing (especially with that evil grin). He also includes a new chest piece which doesn't have much detail, but is&nbsp;still cool. Also, he has the Thornraxx head in silver (or some shade of silver) and the&nbsp;particularly nice mace pieces. They are made of two separate pieces, and, while simple, get the job done.&nbsp;My favorite piece, however, would easily be the blade at the bottom of the mace. The green on it is particularly cool and that combined with the detailed base makes for an excellent looking weapon.</p>
<p>Another particularly interesting piece is the new bone extender. I'm pretty sure this is mostly meant to be a joint strengthener rather that an extender, but it can serve both purposes. And, I will&nbsp;say it does make the joint stronger, but mainly for only up, down, and outward movements. When rotating the arm, there isn't much increased friction.</p>
<p>Other interesting pieces include a new green-colored Glatorian head, size 3 trans-lime green cladding, the new Thornax launcher piece (new mold), and the black armor pieces on his thighs which I don't have a name for.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>None. Black Phantom would eat them anyway.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Fire Lord. That's really all I can say.</p>
<p>Okay, there are some differences. Mainly, it's just the legs that are the same as FL. The new pieces made the build entertaining, but I still have to rate it a three. The legs, like I said, are exactly the smae as Fire Lord, and what's new with the upper half is incredibly simple.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Despite a rather uninteresting build, the completed model does not dissapoint. With this set, I feel LEGO has perfected the build for this size of titans. What I particularly like is the exclusion of the arm supports in exchange for these friction joint bone extender whatchamajiggies.</p>
<p>The figure is very menacing and the black is very shiny and pops. He also has some dark red bones (new recolor, btw) which complements the black nicely. I was thinking the back spike things would be awkward, but they have enough poseability to be positioned however you like (unfortunately, the tubes can&nbsp;get in the way at times).</p>
<p>Since it's there, and&nbsp;is fun to play with on its own, the Arachnix Drone deserves going over. Archy (as I'll call it) functions as his gun, but can detach (launcher and all) and become a spiderlike drone. On its own, it's not much. The legs move around, but there really isn't much to him. However, I do feel he's still quite fun the play with just due to&nbsp;his size and appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for complaints, well, I don't have anything major. Sure there's the old socket on the Glatorian head, and legs look oddly familiar, but these really don't affect the set too much.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, Black Phantom is a pretty awesome figure. He's fun to play with, and looks good in pretty much any pose. So, whether you play with your figures or put them on display, he's a worthy buy. MoCists, I'm sure, will not be dissapointed with the black pieces he comes with. Though the build was simplistic, the final model does not dissapoint. </p>
<p>I highly recommend this figure with a score of 5/5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Legosrule91","2012-06-08T16:55:14.62Z","Black Phantom-Mastermind of the Breakout ","Pros:&nbsp;<div><br>This set includes a few pieces that builders &nbsp;will want to add to their collections. There are the long dark red leg pieces and six of them are included in this set, the two black round shoulder armor pieces that are also found in the toxic reapa set and the wide black chest piece can be be used on a hero or villain set. Also the unique helmet that Black Phantom comes with is a nice addition to any hero factory fan's collection. There are also those two grey bone extender pieces, these pieces are only found in this set of the hero Factory line, but these pieces are also found in the super heroes ultra build sets.&nbsp;<div>For a titan set, Black Phantom's overall design is okay and his black color scheme is good</div><div>too.</div><div>For a $20 set, Black Phantom comes with an assortment of interesting pieces that will be a valued addition to any hero factory fan's collection.&nbsp;</div><div>Playability wise: You can have Black Phantom take on a whole bunch of heroes since he towers over the standard hero in size and the arachnix drone can be used as a scout for Black Phantom.&nbsp;</div><div>If you have Rocka, then you can build an alternate model using pieces from Rocka and Black Phantom.&nbsp;</div><div>Cons:</div><div>The zamor sphere can sometimes fall off the launcher, so you could easily lose that piece.</div><div>Black Phantom is a villain set and if you don't like the villain sets, then you won't like this set.&nbsp;</div><div>Black phantom's design mirrors the design of Fire Lord and Rocka XL, especially in the design of the legs. So if you've built Fire Lord or Rocka XL, then the build will feel redundant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div><p>Overall Black Phantom is a great set and he comes with many pieces that will be useful in building your own creations. I enjoyed building this set and its third villain titan set that I have gotten of the Hero Factory line. I wholeheartedly recommend this set for those who are fans of Hero Factory. You won't regret purchasing this set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
