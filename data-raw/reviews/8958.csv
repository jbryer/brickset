<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Brilliant, though strange, coulour scheme: teal, orange, black.</li><li>Awesome headpeice.</li><li>Wiings!</li><li>Ball shooter.</li><li>Interesting build.</li><li>Plenty of teal, new to HF.</li><li>Bag is new.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Impossible to pose well, can only lie down or crawl.</li><li>Red ball in mouth looks ugly</li><li>Spine, at end of tail, is attached ugly.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, a pretty good set, the main problem is that it can't pose flying, or taking off, or landing. Was 9&nbsp;euro in Ireland, good value for money.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
