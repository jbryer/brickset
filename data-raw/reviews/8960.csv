<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>he has a head that separates into two pieces that has not ever been seen in any later HF set</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>his whole design overall reminds me that of Two-Face of the Batman franchise</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>he has two sides to him that are different colors, Titanium Metallic and Bright Red. each represent something that i kinda feel like was an experiment gone wrong, half&nbsp;Mechnical and half mutated organic being</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>now with that out of the way let me give some stuff out because there are tons of good things with the set.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shredding Claw is great</li>
	<li>Infecticide gun is randomly placed but good nonetheless</li>
	<li>the build is a bit wonky at times but alright overall</li>
	<li>figure is very fun to play with as well</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I recommend Splitface. He&#39;s a unique character and you&#39;ll probably have fun with him once you figure how&nbsp;the sides work together..&nbsp;*flips a coin*</p>

I was too young to get into Bionicle, so this was a completely new building technique for me. I found it frustrating that it had so much movement that caused it to be hard to pose and balance at times, but it was still really fun to play with.</p>

<p>Splitface is a villain in this line, but he came with a hero badge that can be placed on the chest like the heroes. There is a unique code on the back of the badge that would unlock the character in a game on LEGO.com. I never got to use this code until it was already outdated. He also has a couple of claws on the right arm that can be used to slash at enemies. On the left arm, there is a ball shooter that shoots a green ball with considerable force. This was my favorite feature of the action figure and I played with it a lot.</p>

<p>The head is on a small, ball joint extension that makes its head lean forward. The head is also made of 3 pieces. The basic head piece and two covers that are placed on the sides. The sides are identical molds so it looks like he has one forward facing head and one upward facing head. It is odd, but I liked it. Overall, he looks like two different, yet similar robots that were fused together to create this character. It is fascinating and fun to use your imagination to see where he came from.</p>

<p>In all, this is a great set. The color scheme works well and it is fun to play with. It also looks great on display for collectors. I know that many people may not agree with me, but I hope that hero factory and the character of Splitface will return someday.</p>
