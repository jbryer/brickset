"David1971","2011-12-28T17:51:45.153Z","Very enjoyable, in an architectural kind of way.","<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So, 2011 is still happening and I am happy to be, presumably, one of the first people to get hold of one of the new LEGO Star Wars ‘planets’ sets.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">First impressions are good. It’s basically a neat idea, isn’t it – you get a planet, with a minifig and a ship from that planet, and that stuff comes actually *inside* the planet. You can see that it’s quite a cool, sort-of innovative idea. Compare this concept with, say, the battle packs, which are just 4 minifigs and a bit of stuff. That’s not such a striking idea. But a series of *planets* … with stuff *inside*! … it’s obviously a winner.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">On the other hand, you could say that this whole concept is actually a really odd idea, because in a small set you get three things on completely different scales. You get a planet, and then, on a massively different scale to that, you get a micro scale spaceship, and then, on a significantly different scale to that again, you get a minifig. On the other hand, if these sets did not come with a minifig it would be really disappointing.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I note that some fans have been worried about the fact that the planet protrudes from the packaging, which could mean that the planet gets scuffed up in transit or in shops. I suppose that’s a good point, but I didn’t think of that. I thought it looked quite cool. And, my one from [UK retail store] Argos (within a day or two of release) was in apparently perfect condition. But I can see that this could be a concern over time.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Another minor observation about the packaging is that it says ‘Series 1’ but it doesn’t tell the non-fan customer what it is ‘Series 1’ of. To fans, it’s obviously this novel series of planet sets. But ‘ordinary’ customers are kind of left to work it out for themselves.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">To review this set more specifically ...</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The planet is nice, and clips together very securely, with a nice clippy system which presumably will become familiar to us. It comes with a black piece to put on the bottom so that it will ‘stand up straight’, as it were, and stay in one place. And it comes with a hoop piece to put on the top, so that you can hang it on the Christmas tree, or any other outer-spacey location of your choice.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Naboo Starfighter is nicely done in micro scale, and this yellow-and-grey/silver spaceship has always been pretty. You admire it, in the same way you admire the Architecture sets. It’s not, like, a great *toy*, but maybe it’s not meant to be a toy really … a thought underlined by the fact that it comes with a display stand (!). The idea of a display stand seems really naff. But actually, in practice, I quite liked it. The label tile is nicely printed, too, and with silver for the Star Wars logo. It feels like they’ve taken care over it. Which, I suppose, again reinforces the idea that it’s more like fine art than like a toy.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, the minifig is a very nice one, with a pleasing ‘serious’ expression, and handsome red clothes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So overall, as an adult I found this to be a very enjoyable piece of LEGO product. For £10, when you’re used to LEGO pricing anyway, I thought that was fine. It’s a very nice thing to sit down with and open and make, even though that pleasure only really lasts for about 20 minutes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For non-fans it might be a bit odd or disappointing. Or, it could be a cool collectible. But basically I think these £10 planets are a good addition to the LEGO Star Wars range, a little bit different, and a pleasant surprise. Well done LEGO.</p><div><br></div><p></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"CapnRex101","2012-01-03T11:04:18.073Z","9674 - Naboo Starfighter and Naboo","<p>I love the Naboo Starfighter as a ship, the simple elegance of the shape is fantastic and I like the colour scheme as well. This mini Naboo Starfighter is a nice model and a great representation of the vessel in the movies, almost as good as the larger Minifigure scale sets. The Planet sets are a bizarre new initiative by the Lego Company but I think they are quite well executed. This set is not the best though, it is good, but I would advise you to purchase Sebulba's Podracer and Tatooine before this one. The figure is reasonable, but not nearly as exciting as Sebulba or the TIE Pilot in set 9676, TIE Interceptor and Death Star. The planet however is the best of the three, much more detailed and accurate than the other two.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the same shape as that of the other Planet sets with the planet open to the outside and, unfortunately, to being damaged. The artwork is the same as all of the other new Star Wars sets with blue borders and a nice picture of Darth Maul swinging his double bladed lightsaber. On the front in the top right corner there is a picture of the Naboo Starfighter flying through space and at the bottom there are shots of the Naboo Pilot and Naboo. On the back we can see more images of the figure, planet and the set itself, as well as some advertising for the other sets in this wave.</p><p>The instructions are stored outside of the planet and share the same artwork as the box. There were no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few decent parts in this set, several yellow cones, four yellow jumper plates and two pearl silver studs (one of them is spare). Not exactly very inspiring is it! There is a nice printed piece which forms part of the stand and gives details about the model too which has a nice shiny silver Star Wars logo on it. Unfortunately, the pieces at the front are just light grey, not silver which is shame.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The <b>Naboo Pilot</b> is a decent figure, but he is not very interesting. It is fairly accurate to their appearance in the films and wears a nicely detailed torso. With him he carries a regular blaster which is always useful and he has a brown helmet with flying goggles.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is short and sweet. I like how the tail is attached keeping the fighter nicely streamlined and elegant, just like the ship is in the Phantom Menace but that is about it. In such a short build though, what do you expect?</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The set looks nice when you are all done, but I am disappointed that they did not put shiny silver pieces at the front of the ship as they could easily have done so. There are only nine pieces which would have to be in silver so it would not have been very expensive or difficult to do if that was what stopped them. It won't break easily so you can swoosh the Naboo Fighter around to your heart's content without fear of&nbsp;spontaneous&nbsp;structure failure. The black stand is not bad and features that nice printed plate I was telling you about earlier. The Naboo model is fabulous with loads of detail and some great cloud effects too, still I bet it raised the price a fair bit and I would rather have had a cheaper price and no planet than have the sets as they are with a planet.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>There are three factors which are important in each of these Planet sets, the Minifigure, the planet and the model. This is the weakest set in terms of both the model and the figure, but the best in terms of the planet. I would advise you to purchase this set, but give set 9675 priority as that one is better in my opinion, this and set 9676 are of a similar standard. Nevertheless, a nice model and one I give...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"Firox_5000","2012-01-19T17:55:02.76Z","Naboo planet","<p>This was the second of the three planet sets I purchsed which I bought from a local toy shop. The set contains 56 pieces and the build is a pleasant and entertaining build if very short. </p>
<p>The set when finished consists of the naboo planet which like all the planets is a very interesting structure which has the same printing on both halves. Unfortunately, this is noticable on some parts. There is also a naboo pilot figure [ the same as in the big starfighter set] who coms with a helmet,goggles and a gun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main feature though of the set is the starfighter itself, a minature version of the 2011 Naboo starfighter. The model itself has been done rather well with alot of it's main details such as long tail,back of wings and front have been done very well [there's even a piece replicating a droid figure]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts in this set are rather common in most genuine lego sets and are nothing special. However the planet object and model plaque are very neat and brand new. Like the other planet sets, the playability of this set alone is quite limited due to no opposing side etc/; meaning playability of the set is only really limited to flying the ship around the planet numerous times and placing it on and off the mini stand which is included. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For £10, the sets value is not great but somewhat perhaps better than the death star one as the model seems to be slightly larger however a retail price at £7.99 would still be better. </p>
<p>To conclude this review, I would recommend this set to any one who wants to get the pilot figure and does not want to buy or pay for the bigger starfighter model, all fans of the star wars mini models, people who want to purchase the awesome planet structure and all fans of star wars. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although if you want this set for playability purposes or decent figures, youre probably buying the wrong set and I would sugguest to buy a battle pack instead if you want a cheap star wars set with decentl playability. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This so far has to be my favourite planet set. I much prefer this to the big starfighter due to it's small size and swooshability and recommend this set for the mini starfighter alone. </p>",TRUE,5,3,3,2,3
"Blockland","2012-08-20T15:09:39.727Z","A beginning to a series....","<p>I got this set for my birthday and I wasnt very impressed at first. It seemed like another attempt at mini ships, with the gimeky planet, but i am still impressed. It took my 3 minutes to figure out the pieces were inside the planet. [yes, a rare moment for a teenager who has been collecting since he was 3] The first thing i built was the minifigure, and it was a nice addition to a army of naboo. The Starfighter was nice and well built, AND WHATS THIS, A SET WITHOUT A FLICKFIRE MISSLE. Even I was expecting one, however, I guess Lego knows that Starfighters dont carry nukes. Either, it was a fun build, and I was overall impressed</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>New Minifigure</li><li>Good Starfighter</li><li>Easy and fun build</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Planet was gimeky</li><li>Not 10 dollars of content</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you buy this out of all the planet sets. It was fun and I was glad I got this.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,1,2
"rockz","2012-12-11T00:51:00.75Z","Naboo Starfighter....cool toy","<p>Been collecting lego ( mainly starwars and superheroes )&nbsp;for the past year&nbsp;and this is my first review and hopes this is useful.</p>
<p>I got this from my local TRU which is having year end sale at SGD13....i must admit when this series was first release, i laughed at it and thinking it is a waste of time for something that cost&nbsp;SGD21.00....so when&nbsp;the price was slashed down....i&nbsp;bought it&nbsp;as a quick fix for my lego addiction and surprisingly it was quite a decent piece.</p>
<p>i am now truely addicted to the planet series as the mini model actually looks good on the display with the name tag indicating the planet where it is seen and the&nbsp;name of the model.&nbsp;The minifig&nbsp;display together&nbsp;with fighter is&nbsp;a great finishing touch.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>Great for kids or new collector to start their collection with.</p>
<p>The colors are bright and eye catching on your display shelf</p>
<p>The planet container actually makes a good container for your extra pieces of lego bricks.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>The planet container feel like cheap plastic and really not much playabilty.</p>
<p>The fighter model seems to have a fews gaps and its just does not look tight enuff.</p>
<p>Minifig</p>
<p>Nuttin much to say about the minifig, it comes with a helmet, goggle and a blaster but if u are missing this minifig from your collection, then this is much cheaper to get compare to buying the big fighter set.</p>
<p>Overall, it is really a good piece for displaying with the bright colors piece and easy to built but I would suggest to wait it out for discount from your local store to pick it up. Playablity wise, it good for swooshing around&nbsp;but as a adult collector, i&nbsp;am more interested in&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;set that&nbsp;is good for display and this is one of those which look good on your display.&nbsp;</p>

"B_Scheibs","2012-06-05T19:14:55.5Z","Let the Battle of Naboo Begin!","The Planet series is new to LEGO Star Wars, and it seemed to me like a pretty good idea. <br>The smallest of the 3 is 9674 Naboo Starfighter and Naboo. This has 1 minifigure, 56 pieces, and costs $9.99, a good price for all of the Planet sets. While the price per piece is 17.8 cents per piece, I think the price and value are still good, and it shouldn't be lower or higher. One interesting note is the box, as the planet is sticking out the front and back and all the parts are put inside the planet. I thought that was a cool way to produce and package the set. Anyways, onto the set.<br><br>The first part of these sets is the minifigure, and in this case we get the Naboo pilot. Some people may complain that it has been used in another set before, but the figure works well with the set as the model is a Naboo Starfigher. He comes with a brown helmet, concerned face, and a standard blaster. I like the red color scheme, and only the front is printed. It is very nice, and resembles the jacket well. I like the fact the figure is generic, and I would much rather buy this set to get him rather than buying the overpriced 7877 Naboo Starfighter. <br><br>Next is the second part, the mini model. I expected this one to be small and flimsy, but it's not that bad. First of all, there are only two studs, giving it a very sleek finish. The yellow poles coming off the wing tips and the back are at a perfect length, and really look nice! The shape is great, and the look is too! The one problem is that on the long pole on the back has a gap in it, showing part of a gray peg. While this may seem like a minor problem, it doesn't look the greatest, and could have been easily fixed.<br><br>Now onto the planet itself! The planet comes in two halves which easily snap together, and can be rearranged for a slightly different look. Interestingly enough, they are printed exactly the same. I must say, I really like the look of it, and the printing is very nice and spot on. The mix of blue, green, and white is great, and I like the two pieces that can be attached. One keeps it upright, and the other can have string be put through it so it can be hung from a ceiling. I first thought you would be able to fit the model inside the planet, but you aren't able to. That's hardly a problem at all since LEGO gave you a stand to put the figure and model on. I don't think Naboo is as iconic as Tatooine or the Death Star, but it is well known and it is very nice.<br><br>Also included is a stand to put the figure and starfigher on, and the fighter gets a swiveling stand. The main reason I mention this is because included with the stand is a PRINTED name plate! If only they did that for the UCS Series. Anyways, the tile names everything included with the set: Royal N-1 Starfighter, Naboo Pilot, Naboo. It's awesome that LEGO decided to include that.<br><br>Overall, this is a nice set and worth getting. I like the whole concept for the Planet sets, and I hope they continue on in 2013. This is the weakest of the three so far, yet I still like it, so that's a good sign. There's not much playability since this is mainly for display, but I think you'll have fun swooshing it around. As for pieces, they're pretty good, especially the planet halves. If you want the figure without paying 50 bucks, this is the way to go, and the model is great as well as the planet. On a scale of 10, I give it a 7.5, so around a 4 out of 5. I hope you found the review helpful, and you enjoyed reading it.- BrickLife4809<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-30T21:43:37.5Z","Naboo is Green","<p><strong>Set #9674 Naboo Starfighter &amp; Naboo: </strong>LEGO's planet sets are all relatively identical in certain areas, the planets may all have different prints however they are still the same basic parts. The stands are all pretty much relatively identical, and if it weren't for the unique name plates they wouldn't stand out at all. However I still think there is a lot to offer from these small sets.</p>
<p>This is the last Planet set from Series 1 that I've finally picked up, the planet itself isn't much to talk about. Two large semi-circle chunks of plastic that click together to represent the Planet Naboo. The print work is highly detailed, showing off the continents, oceans and other elements one would expect to see from a planet in space, some consider them useless, others find them useful as parts storage areas. (In fact I enjoy putting the parts for the stand and miniature ships inside when not built on display.) Many others just ditch them in the rubbish bin, which is a really unfortunate idea as clever LEGO Builders could find a lot to do with these, they are perfect actually for building a LEGO Star Wars Planetary Mobile for hanging over a baby's crib or just plain hanging from the cieling.</p>
<p>Moving on, the main build is a small model of a starship. Like many small models, often found in Polybags, these are much improved from past offerings from LEGO. The mini-Naboo Starfighter looks great, perfectly capturing the look and feel of the ships seen in TPM. It features a lot of nice yellow and grey colored parts and one silver stud for an astromech dome, I enjoy the simple and fun steps used to create this small model. It's too bad that these didn't sell better as the Planet Series is being replaced with something I feel to be a tad worse.</p>
<p>Mini-Figure wise you get a Naboo Pilot. All in red, with a single sided torso print showing off the undercoat typically worn by Naboo Pilots, he also includes a blaster and brown hands for gloves. Single-sided head print unfortunately and the helmet used is not new, we've seen it many times in the past. He's still a solid little Mini-Figure and great to own.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say if you can find this, especially now, you're bound to get good discounts on them as stores try to clearance them off to be rid of the excess sets from 2012. The miniature model is a fun easy to build design with great play value, as it is much easier to grab these smaller ships and whoosh them around when you feel like playing with them. A pity LEGO hasn't yet made a Vulture Droid in this scale for it to duke out against, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time before a polybag is revealed. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Niftybrick","2013-10-24T12:46:18.627Z","A World Apart","<p>At 10 dollars for a ball, a minifig and a few pieces I've avoided these sets. Hanging out at the back of the Kmart clearance section was this guy marked down to a dollar with another 30% markdown on top of that. For .76 cents it seemed to be a pretty good deal so I tried to come up with an excuse to bring&nbsp;it home. The globe is similar to earth so I took that approach. ""Look! It's a world for planes and spaceships to fly around and pretend they're in space,"" I eagerly explained to my wife.</p>
<p>My daughter and I ripped open the box and had a look. Hiding the pieces inside the ball was pretty cool. An essential part was missing though. (maybe from sitting on the salesfloor for so long?) The instructions were missing. This gave us probably more fun than this set was intended as we tried to build it just from the pictures on the now torn up box.</p>
<p>The spaceship after only two weeks has already been dissasembled and sorted and the minifig is somewhere in the people parts. The globe however may stay set up rotating in space below a shelf for quite some time.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you can find it at this price it's a no brainer! 
<li>The globe is a pretty good earth lookalike and has lots of MOC potential. 
<li>The pilot's hat will work great as an old WWII ace cap.</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>For non Star Wars collectors at the original price there isn't much appeal. 
<li>Now I may be tempted to buy another one.</li></ul>
<p>Overall a great experience and worth the .76 cents. I'd recommend picking one up just for the globe.</p>",TRUE,3,2,4,4,5
