"David1971","2011-12-31T17:43:12.973Z","That's no moon! But it's a pleasant, if monochrome, LEGO Easter egg for you.","<p>A couple of days ago I reviewed the Naboo set from the new 'Planets' series, set #9674, which included some general comments about the series: see <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=42350"">http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=42350</a></p>
<p>Basically I said that&nbsp;these 'Planets' sets are&nbsp;a cool and striking idea, and I found it an enjoyable way to spend 20 minutes, at the very least. I noted that it's more a thing to be admired than to be played with, really. And I observed that it's a bit odd to get a set with things on three completely different scales: a planet, on what would have to be called megamicro scale, a starship,&nbsp;at micro scale, and a minifig, which -&nbsp;unlike everything else in the set - is (of course) on minifig scale.</p>
<p>The set with the slightly strange title of 'Naboo Starfighter &amp; Naboo' was nicely colourful. But&nbsp;'TIE Interceptor &amp;&nbsp;Death Star' is, predictably,&nbsp;all blacks and greys.</p>
<p>The planet in this set, is, of course, not a planet (""That's no moon,"" as Obi-Wan famously murmurs). I wondered if LEGO would have bothered having that indented circle thing,&nbsp;which the massive energy beam shoots out from in the films, or if they would just do a sphere. But of *course* LEGO have done it properly. So the Death Star looks very good. I had sort of assumed that all of the planets in the 'Planets' series would be a bit of a waste of space, in terms of whether you could use them for anything after building the set, but it seems possible that you might be able to use the Death Star for something. Can't quite think what, at the moment. Except, of course, for being a rather cool Death Star.</p>
<p>The spaceship here, the TIE Interceptor, is a good demonstration of how you can do a very cool spaceship in relatively few pieces of LEGO. Being small, it's inevitably a bit underwhelming. But it's neat.</p>
<p>The minifig in this set, the TIE Fighter Pilot, is good, with nice silver printing, although the helmet looks slightly massive compared to the rest of the guy. But he's cool, and best of all is that *finally* - as Huw <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=2186"">unveiled on Brickset</a> a few days ago -&nbsp;the LEGO designers have acknowledged that LEGO Star Wars stormtroopers (and their, er, colleagues, like this pilot) are human beings and therefore should have faces. I always thought it was really bad, before, that clone troopers and stormtroopers would have black blobs instead of heads under their helmets. It seemed unusually odd and&nbsp;lazy of LEGO, to not even give them heads, since we know these guys do *have* heads under their helmets! So apparently, from now on, these guys will have actual heads. Excellent.</p>
<p>Overall, then: Well, this is inevitably the most 'classic' of the first three 'Planets' sets, as it comes with the Death Star from the much-loved first Star Wars movie, and a classic vehicle and minifig. Surprisingly, perhaps, I think I probably preferred the Naboo set, with its good rich colours, over&nbsp;this one - the black and grey is less stimulating. But this is a fun (if very easy and quick) build, and it's still cool to get a planet and all the stuff inside the planet - like an Easter egg - and ... well, it's worth £10 of anyone's money.</p>

"Firox_5000","2012-01-15T09:08:24.153Z","Death star planet ","<p>I bought this set at my local toy shop for £9.99. The set's box is of a similar size ot the bp sets with the planet sticking out of the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet is not covered or protected which in most cases is not a good thing as the planet object is liable to get damaged e.g falling on the floor or get touched and handled by numerous children [some cleaner and dirtier than others]. The main reason I bought this was because of the mini death star and the mini model. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After opening the box and taking the planet out, the set's content is inside of the planet itself which consists of two fair sized poly bags which build the mode. The building experience is very short and easy but is yet rather interesting with the building of the interceptors wings. The build duration should be around&nbsp;5 minutes. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the finished model, you get a tie interceptor, tie fighter pilot, stand for the ship and figure and the death star itself. The tie interceptor is very well done with on the mini scale with the mini cockpit front and binocular pieces used as guns and has been presented very nicely. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The figure is also of a good standard as the figure has a face under the pilot mask. The stand on it's own is nothing special but provides an interesting support for the model and figure with a stand for the interceptor and also a small plaque of info of the model. The death star itself is a rally good planet and has plenty of detail such as the laser carved on to the mould itself and also includes a hanging piece in which the planet can be hung up [ no string included].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For £9.99 for a medium sized planet, small mini vehicle and figure the price tag is rather expensive for what is included and a price of £7.99 would be more feesable imo. The playability of the set on it's own is rather limited as all it can be done is the tie interceptor can fly around the death star numerous times but thats about it. In my view, This set is sort of my for display purposes than play value in most cases. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a final summary, the set is quite good and lego have done a nice job on the death star mould and the mini Tie Interceptor. I would recommend this set to any one who has interest the tie pilot due to it's low price, people who want a mini death star and are not able to find or afford the large model, any one who really likes star wars mini model sets and hard core fans of Lego star wars. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However I dont recommend to people who want a set with good playability. If you are interested in this set I may sugguest trying to wait and buy it reduced. But if you really want it, I would recommend buying it and adding it to any galaxy of star wars collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,1,2
"CapnRex101","2012-04-05T09:32:33.77Z","9676 - TIE Interceptor and Death Star","<p>In my opinion these 'Planets' sets have been a great success, I am a great advocate of mini sets and this seems to be the current incarnation of this most affordable and fantastic kind of model. This lovely little set is probably my favourite of the three for many reasons, the Minifigure, a very welcome TIE pilot, the TIE Interceptor itself and the monochrome but still detailed Death Star. The parts selection is superb with a few black plates and some useful dishes. Anyway, let's get on to the review...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the same shape as the other two Planets sets with the planet in pride of place and plenty of pictures of the figure and the model all over the box. As I have mentioned in my previous reviews of this line of sets, I was disappointed to see no protection for the planet which is wide open to being scratched and damaged on the shelf. Nevertheless, the box is eye catching and interesting which is great and of the three sets I have purchased, none of them have been at all damaged so that is a very minor issue.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some very nice parts for a relatively low price here, as I said in the introduction, some of my favourites are the small dish pieces and the four black sloping plates. Those four nice light grey binoculars are a great addition too and look brilliant as guns on this model. The four double cheese wedge parts in light grey are nice too with plenty of applications for those. There is no doubt though for me the best bit would have to be the printed small translucent dish piece which could be used for any miniature TIE fighter as well as some sort of computer monitor if you prefer Minifigure scale.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>There is one figure in this set like all of the other Planets sets released thus far and this is my favourite of the lot. Since the inclusion of this new <b>TIE Fighter Pilot</b> design in the TIE Defender (8087) from a few years ago I have adored this figure and now that he features the head printed with a body glove he is even better. He is identical to the one included with the new TIE Fighter set (9492) which I have reviewed and a lovely figure. I love the helmet design and the torso printing is very well detailed so this figure is faultless in my opinion, not only is it my favourite of the three Minifigures, but it is useful to have in multiples as well. He comes with a single short blaster as well which is always welcome.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build for this set doesn't take long but is rewarding as it demonstrates a couple of nice techniques. I like how the wings struts are formed using the double cheese wedges to create a fairly flush final surface. It is also&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;to see the ratchet jointed hinges holding the wings at the correct angle.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished, this is great looking piece. The Interceptor looks superb on or off the stand and is very swooshable due to the sturdy construction and easy to hold cockpit area. In my opinion this is the best model of the three (although Sebulba's Podracer is a very close second). With the upcoming X-Wing and Yavin IV Planet set you could have a great dogfight which would increase playability a lot I imagine. I like the printed information tile which is featured in all three sets on the display stand and I am really glad that Lego elected to include this lovely little detail. The Death Star is an interesting item. Only one colour of course (accurate to the film) but still very well detailed with the super laser eye and loads of little tiny trenches crossing the surface. I have seen this piece used on a lot of MOCs in just the first few months it has been available and I would love to see what sort of uses others have found for it.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I would highly recommend this set to anyone and although I am going to award it the same score as Sebulba's Podracer I would go for this one over either of the other two, no doubt about it. Great parts selection, great Minifigure and a nice Death Star too, a sure winner.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 8/10</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

"nevertrustahippy","2012-02-11T02:33:56.133Z","A minifig, model & a Christmas tree decoration.","<p>The release series one of the planet sets is clearly timed to match the release of Episode One in 3D. &nbsp;Podracing and Naboo are fine but as far as I'm concerned, it's the original trilogy (where Han shot first) that's the real Star Wars so I was only going to buy the Death Star. Also, a Lego Death Star of any size at a price such as this isn't to be sneezed at either. &nbsp;</p><p>For the Star Wars Geek there is first the question of why an intact Death Star is grouped with a TIE&nbsp;Interceptor, which only appeared in Return of the Jedi (yes, yes, the books/comics/games have it appearing earlier, but that doesn't count).&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem, from a Star Wars purist point of view, is that the four&nbsp;separate wings/arrays arranged in a X configuration rather than the more accurate representation in set 6206. &nbsp;On the other hand the TIE Pilot in this set is more&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;than the set 6206 minifigure.&nbsp;</p><p>The only other gripe about the set applies to the whole series. &nbsp;The&nbsp;different&nbsp;scales of the three models seriously reduce the playability of the set by itself, but then this series is for display not play, so that's not really an issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Accuracy towards the Star Wars canon aside, this set provides three good models in one pack. The minifigure is nicely detailed and stacks up very well with the other Star Wars figs in terms of looks. &nbsp;The TIE Interceptor is nicely proportioned and colour balanced. The&nbsp;designers have cleverly used the Lego parts bin and the model is&nbsp;sturdy enough for playing about with. &nbsp;The display stand for the minifigure and the model is just right for the job as well. &nbsp;It'll sit very nicely&nbsp;among&nbsp;any Lego display or by itself. &nbsp;</p><p>The Death Star is detailed enough given the limitations of such a small set and will&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;be hanging from my Christmas tree later this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While this set won't be bought for MOCs, it contains a very good selection of parts. &nbsp;Two nice micro space/aircraft could be crafted from the set. &nbsp;Overall the parts are varied and generic enough to provide lots of nice detail or secondary structure for larger creations. &nbsp;The build itself is a simple experience but at this scale you're not buying it for the fun of the build.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall this is an average build and play set, a better than average MOC set and a excellent display set. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-03T12:49:09.997Z","The Death Star!","<p>Set #9676 TIE Interceptor &amp; Death Star: LEGO gives us a cheap alternative to a 500$ Death Star playset, a tiny planet set version to hang somewhere or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The Death Star planet piece is the only one to feature unique molded detail work compared to the printed detailing of the other planets. There are the trenches, the superlaser and all of this in something the size of a Pokeball. (Well maybe just a little bit bigger than a Pokeball.) This Planet Set is one you can't pass up. I'm curious to see how LEGO might attempt to give us a Death Star II in this sub-theme of the Star Wars theme.</p>
<p>The Mini-Model in this set is the TIE Interceptor, not actually from A New Hope I think LEGO just used this vehicle instead of a regulra TIE or the TIE Advanced so they could give us a great looking little model to add to our collections. The build is quick and easy with only so many pieces to work with it does a surprisingly impressive job of capturing the look of the craft in question. It also features a printed piece for the cockpit rather than just sticking us with a plain looking transparent piece.</p>
<p>Lastly is the TIE Fighter Pilot, a great looking Mini-Fig all in black with superb and realsitic looking detailing. The rebreather is accurate to the on-screen counterpart and the helmet is great. (If I'm not mistaken its the same one that was used for the AT-AT Driver in the Hoth Battle Pack. I just can't remember if early TIE pilots used this piece or the standard Stormtrooper helmet in black.) He's sporting a blaster and the brand new printed face head print introduced this year for all Imperial Troopers. (With an evil looking smile and some stubble, looks like the Empire doesn't mind if you wait a while to shave.)</p>
<p>Overall the Planet sets are a great bargain for Mini-Ship enthusiasts, they are much easier to find than the Polybagged sets, and they include a Mini-Fig, an awesome display stand with printed tile and of course the giant planets. Giant being a relative term of course. Brick Film and Diorama lovers rejoice as there is much to be done with these little planets. You can't go wrong with them, I certainly hope we see more of this TIE Interceptor model though, it does make it a bit more difficult to army build a tiny armada of ships when you get stuck with the Death Star over and over again. Then again the POB section of LEGO Stores might have all you need to assemble a small squad of Interceptors once you have the instructions and piece information to do so. Really great job LEGO.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard planet box that still unfortunately leaves the planet exposed to scratching. Instruction booklet is folded in half but otherwise nondescript.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Has a great selection of SNOT pieces. The highlight has to be a printed mini TIE cockpit piece. Death Star is excellent and thus far the only asymmetric planet.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The TIE pilot has a great looking front printed torso and helmet.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>A quick build with symmetry that might be repetitive to some. Nothing really out of the ordinary except for the one stud in the middle of four (like 5 on a die or body centered cubic to the nerds).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The cockpit has a rather squarish appearance despite the designers best efforts to use disks attempt a spherical shape. It looks somewhat like a TIE X-wing rather than two wings. Nevertheless, it is instantly recognizable as a TIE interceptor.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Mini build is good looking despite the squarish cockpit and contains many useful pieces. Minifig is excellent. Swooshable mini build and mini Death Star.
