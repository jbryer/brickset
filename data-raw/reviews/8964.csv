This one, Sebulba's Podracer and Tatooine is a great offering, with plenty of nice parts and of course the lovely Sebulba Minifigure. The planet itself is nice as well but I cannot help but think that it significantly raises the price for no good reason. Despite the fairly high price, the set is good and for those of you without set 7962, Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba's Podracers, this is a must have as you get Sebulba for your collection without you having to fork out fork out for the entire&nbsp;Podrace&nbsp;set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packaging is very unique, firstly, it has a hanger for being put on racks in shops on the top unlike most Lego sets. More noticeably however there is the huge planet sticking out of the front and back of the box! This is a nice design as it is certainly eye catching but it does cause a slight problem. There is nothing to protect the planet from scratches which means that you might open up the box to find the set damaged, it could have been solved easily by adding a bit of plastic to cover the planet so I wish they had done that. The back of the box shows the Podracer flying through the dunes of Tatooine in the top right corner, and the planet and Sebulba are displayed at the bottom of the box. There is also a bit of advertising for the other two sets in Series One. Apart from that the box is the same as usual with dark blue and white borders, and Darth Maul in action at the top.</p><p>The instructions are the only thing stored outside of the planet in the box and share the same design as the box with Darth Maul and the blue borders. There were no mistakes that I could see and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is a lot of orange in this model. Orange is not a common colour so it is nice that we get so much of it in this set. There are quite a lot of grill pieces and a couple of those nice column parts in light grey as well. We get a translucent rod used for connecting the cockpit and the engines and ,best of all in my opinion, two pink lightsaber blades which form the energy binders. Not bad at all given the price.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p><b>Sebulba</b> is, as I said in my review of Anakin Skywalker's and Sebulba's&nbsp;Podracers, a spectacular figure with plenty of detailed printing and incredible&nbsp;accuracy&nbsp;to the film. His legs are poseable and in his hands (which are connected into one piece) he holds a spanner, the only accessory he comes with. If you don't have the bigger set he is in, this is a great way to get him.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build takes about ten minutes and is quite fun. I love seeing how they use parts in these mini sets and this one cleverly uses torch pieces to form the basis for attaching the unique split engines. Apart from that there really is not a lot going on here!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model&nbsp;itself&nbsp;looks great. There is a lot of detail for something so small and it is sturdy as well, so you can have your own mini&nbsp;Podrace&nbsp;if you made some of the other racers yourself in mini. The pieces are all stored in the planet which looks very good and has a lot of detail such as clouds and different tones of sand just like Tatooine in the films, but was it really needed? I am not so sure it was. It has a small hanger which attaches to the top so you can attach some string and hang it up if you like. I am afraid it probably bumped the price up by a couple of pounds but never mind, it is nice to have anyway. It all comes on a black stand which features a wonderful printed tile telling you what the model is, in this case ' Sebulba's Podracer, Sebulba, Tatooine.' Once complete the Podracer measures about eleven centimetres long and seven centimetres wide, just the right size I think.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Basically, I would advise you to buy this set. It is not ground breaking but it has a good design, and a great figure. The price of Â£9.99 is a bit steep, but it is still worth it in my opinion. I will knock a point off for the fairly high price and the lack of any protection for the Tatooine model so...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"AETerry","2012-02-10T15:41:43.9Z","Sebulba's Podracer Minikit & Tatooine Planet Set Review","<p>I will confess, I went for this particular Planet Set for the Sebulba minifigure. I wasn't prepared for just how good the rest of the set would be and I wanted to scoff at the hollow plastic planet as a gimmick. I must find myself standing corrected with my initial impressions.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is comparative to other boxed sets for LEGO sets but is designed so the hollow plastic planet ""bulges"" out and can be physically seen. The instructions are the only part of the set actually inside the box with all the pieces held within the planet.</p><p>The instructions of course are in booklet form with clear step-by-step illustrations and are easy to follow. Each page features a ""faded"" image of Darth Maul up in the corner for the Star Wars image and give them a little more character instead of just being plain and boring.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are 80 pieces in all, many of which are a brilliant, vibrant orange for Sebulba's podracer. Most notable for me were two pink transparent ""light sabre"" blades. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's only one minifigure with this set and that is of Sebulba. And at roughly $9.99, this is the cheapest set in which to get him from. So those collecting up just Star Wars minifigures are sure to be happy with this instead of trying to purchase larger sets for him. He's very well detailed, though I minorly dislike that his hands are all one piece making it look like he's only got three limbs.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>I got the first run of Star Wars minikits featuring Sebulba's Podracer and I have to say I like this one far better as even though it's still micro-scale, it's on a bit larger scale to be able to capture many of the details and elements of the podracer. The elements and bricks for this design are well picked out and it was, while very quick, enjoyable to put together.</p><p>The completed set is that of a stand for displaying the finished podracer next to Sebulba with a plaque sticking out with names of the character and set. It makes it perfect for placing up on a shelf for display and it's better for that compared to other minkits I have. The plastic hollow Tatooine Planet is also great for use in storing the set away later.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The sheer beauty and detail of Sebulba's micro-scale podracer has won me over and has me reevaluating my initial impressions of this set. It's fantastic and well worth it to anyone seeking to collect them, even if there's only one set they want. I may not personally pick up any of the others yet. But at $9.99 per set, they're well worth it. And the hollow planets are worth it too for those looking for means of storage later.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"Firox_5000","2012-07-22T13:14:18.513Z","Mini Pod racer ","This was the last planet set i purchased from the first series. The model comes in small box with the contents stored inside the planet structure which is already built up. The built takes just over five minutes to complete and when finished shows off the ship,figure on a built stand.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The main part of the set is the mini pod racer model using many mini cheese slope pieces and new articulated round pieces at the end. The overall model has been done rather nicely with the front of the racer scaled rather well and also the back of the racer where Sebulba sits in the controls.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The figure in this set is Subulba who while not a brand new figure is a great addition to this set as the only other model he has appeared in the large pod racer set which is eight times more in price than this model which for those who can't afford or have interest in the large set but still want sebublba can buy this set for a much cheaper price. While he only has one central arm, he is a very neat figure and for the price is very good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The stand itself is nothing much special but displays both subulba and the racer rather nicely along with a display plaque too. As for the planet itself, the printing of it is very interesting and perhaps the nicest printed planet of series one however doesn't really add much to the set although however the concept of the set inside the planet is quite cool and quite an original idea.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To sum this set off, It's a very nice mini pod racer with a cool figure and for any one who likes mini star wars models,the sebulba figure and can't afford the pod racer set this set is certainly for you. This is a set I strongly recommend to all star wars fans young and old.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-03T10:57:11Z","A Planetary Alignment","<p>Set #9675 Sebulba's Podracer &amp; Tatooine: LEGO Brings us a pretty decent display piece with these Planet Sets from the Star Wars Theme. On top of that they give us a way to get some nifty little Mini-Figs cheaply.</p>
<p>The Planet Sets are a unique offering in that they feature a Mini Ship Build, a Mini-Fig and the new planet of the Star Wars Galaxy piece. Each planet is based on the exact same two connectible semi-circles, the only difference is the color of the piece and the detail printing used on the outside surface to differentiate each planet.</p>
<p>Tatooine is impressive looking, I mean sure it's just&nbsp;a big chunk of plastic that probably drives the cost up needlessly, and yet I'm finding myself looking forward to picking up each new set. While some might think the planets are limited in what you can do that is just simply not the case, they come with two parts that allow for it to display on a shelf or hang from a mobile/christmas tree/cieling. And then there's other possibilities. One thought I had was taking the Death Star, removing the top half and building up some impressive looking explosion diorama with red and orange pieces attached to the connector point on the inside of the piece. (You'd need a lot of orange and red pieces though.) You could even treat each half of the planet like a Star Wars version of the Ninjago Spinners, there are any number of creative possibilities to have some real fun for kids and kids at heart.</p>
<p>Each planet includes a few flat plates to build a display stand, included with this is a printed plate featuring the names of each item in the set, the planet, the mini-ship build and the Mini-Fig. Again perfect for displaying these sets.</p>
<p>The main model build of these sets is a Mini Ship design, a Mini-Ship design that has come a long way since the original Mini ships introduced in the early 2000s, Sebulba's Podracer is the model you build in this set and its just massive, larger than the first mini build and looking much closer to how the Podracer actually looks on screen in condensed form. There are a few decent pieces, lots of orange parts that you might want to re-use in other builds, the way its built though I just can't imagine taking the parts and using them for any MOCs. I just dig the look of this thing, the only problem is you can't really grip it very well for swishing it around when you want to have a race between this and the polybag Anakin's Podracer set.</p>
<p>Sebulba himself is just gorgeous, I mean detail wise. Take a look at the 1999 Sebulba, comparing that to this one is just unfair to the '99 Sebulba. I mean LEGO did what it could to represent a character with such an unconventional body type at the time, and now years later of course they are going to improve upon it. Sebulba is basically three pieces, a solid torso with front 'arms' and his two 'legs' which connect similar to the Battle Droid arm pieces. There is a lot of paint used to handle the numerous details, his flesh, his goggles, his clothes, even different paint markings on his 'legs/arms' in a purple color to show off the patterns seen there in the film.</p>
<p>The Mini-Fig is just drop-dead goregous, and this set is the cheapest method of obtaining it, I am so glad LEGO decided to include him instead of just a generic pilot like with most of the other planet sets. He also comes with a wrench, for sabotage or perhaps repair work on his podracer.</p>
<p>Overall I'm going to say that, while the planet pieces themselves might not be everyone's cup of tea, these sets are just awesome. The Mini-Ship Builds are satisfying in their level of detail and simple/fast build, the Mini-Figs are a great bonus for collectors who enjoy having unique looking Mini-Figs at decent price ranges, and the display stands with printed elements are perfect for displaying these things. I'd say these are great fun and at the price they ask for aren't so bad, they are the exact same price as a Ninjago Spinner in Canada and offer a lot more pieces, definitely pick one or two up if you can for this holiday season.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"NWB","2012-12-12T19:34:56.073Z","Review #2 9675 Sebulba's Podracer & Tatooine","<p>Second review, here we go! This is the 9675 Sebulba's 
Podracer &amp; Tatooine Which is one of the new Planet sets that got 
issued in January 2012 along with 2 other Planets (9674 &amp; 9676). On 
the box it says that this is one of the Series 1 Planets which means 
that there are more to come. So, this is a 'common' Star Wars set which 
you should be able to find at any major retailer that carries Star Wars 
Legos. The RRP is $9.99 USD and it contains 80 pieces.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>If you look at the box before opening it you can see part of the planet 
which is the same as all of the planet sets. So when you open the box 
and pull out the planet you see that the instructions are stored right 
above the planet inside the box but the bags of parts are inside the 
planet.<br><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8090/8351224844_276b078b86.jpg[/img]</span><br><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8230/8351225036_baa2b17ced.jpg[/img]</span><br><br><h4>Parts</h4><p>As noted in the introduction there are 80 pieces included in this set. 
The new parts in this set are of course the pieces that make the planet 
which could also make an epic christmas ornament like all of the other 
planet sets, and the printed tile, and the orange vertical clips have 
only been put in one other set (the 30025 Clown Fish), and there are 
also two of the 2x2 round bricks with grille which are newer pieces and 
are very useful, and of course the parts to Sebulba. The pieces are 
12.448 cents a piece when you average it out, which is about the normal price for a Licensed 
theme.</p><p>5/5</p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8051/8350162143_3ea8154e88.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8194/8350162275_5b98935469.jpg[/img]</span><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There is only one minifig in this set which is Sebulba (sw326). He has 
appeared in one other set (7992) so its not the most common fig and he 
costs about $8.50 new on Bricklink. Its a new mold and is amazing,&nbsp; 
especially compared with the old Sebulba fig from 1999 and has been long
 overdue for a new one. It has some great printing and he comes with a 
wrench for a accessory.</p><p>5/5</p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8193/8350162493_b1abe6f2be.jpg[/img]</span><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is a fun little build and is very easy and just like the box 
says most any 6 year olds should be able to build it by themselves. Its 
pretty straight forward and goes fairly fast.</p><p>4/5<br></p>
<h4>The completed model/Playability</h4><p>When you compare it to the larger podracer that was released last fall (7962) it looks amazing for its scale. Once you finish building this set you see that this set has some but not a tone of playability. It would go great 
however with the 30057 Anakin's Pod Racer (which I reviewed earlier) so 
you could have your epic mini pod racer race just like in The Phantom 
Menace.</p><p>3/5</p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8350162637_4a3fe6235f.jpg[/img]</span><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A good little set which makes a good a impulse buy. It could be a little
 cheaper but overall it a good buy and as said before the planet would make a good 
christmas ornament!</p><p>4/5</p><p><span><span></span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8185/8351227152_3fe5f6c773.jpg[/img]</span><span></span><br></p><p><br></p><p>You can also find this review at my Google+ page here:https://plus.google.com/u/0/114440444827531838932/posts/7vVg4XB4v6u, and

"fatpretzel","2012-07-01T13:23:38.057Z","Two out of three ain't bad.","I really like mini-sets. I think that they really showcase the creativity of the designers. Mini-sets are also nice for display because they don't take up a lot of room. I think LEGO had a great idea to include mini-figures and display stands with the mini-sets. The only down side from this set is the planet. (It's the whole theme!) Well, as Meatloaf once said, ""Two out of three ain't bad.""<div><br></div><h4>Box</h4><p>This is a new design for LEGO sets. The biggest change is the planet that sticks out of the front of the box showing you the newest innovation. While it does show off the planet, it doesn't do a very good job protecting it. The rest of the box does a good job showing the set and the Sebulba mini-figure. An added bonus on the back shows the other sets in the series. Once you open the box, you find out that there are no pieces. There all inside the planet. Only the instructions are actually inside the box.</p><p><br></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instruction booklet is 4""x6"" and folded in half. I saw no typos or mistakes in my booklet. Each step includes a parts list. The back of the manual includes a complete parts list. This will come in handy if you ever find yourself missing a piece. The back couple of pages are advertisements for other available sets and other LEGO video games. A nice bonus is the mini-figure list that comes with the other sets that were released at the same time.</p><p><br></p><h4>Mini-Figures</h4><p>This is the first series of mini-sets that has a mini-figure. Sebulba is much more detailed than previous version. There is lots of color and a nice sneering expression on his face. The inclusion of movable legs (arms?) is nice, however his arms (legs?) don't move and are fused together. He is also gets a wrench to disable Anakin's pod with.</p><h4>Assembly</h4><p>This set goes together quickly and has some interesting techniques for building. The engine pods are very detailed and with lots of orange bricks. Sebulba's cockpit seems to be lacking detail compared to the engine pods. The display stand is a great addition. My only complaint is that I would have liked to have seen the blue image of the set on the display plate like the UCS sets.&nbsp;</p><h4>Playability</h4><p>Detached from the stand, this set is very durable and would be very nice for replaying the Mos Espa podrace.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The planet is the only negative to this set. I think it jacks up the price of the set while not adding any value to the set. I will probably put the planet away somewhere. It really just looks like a big brown blob. I don't think Tatooine was ever a memorable sight from orbit. If we could somehow take it out of the set and knock a couple of dollars off the price, I think we would have a 5 Brick set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,2
"Sidebroad","2013-09-09T20:05:23.023Z","Do you dig the Dug?","<p>A relatively cheap way to obtain new Sebulba minifig. Planet looks great but mini build is mediocre with limited utility of its parts.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard planets packing with instructions in box and parts in planet.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not much to get excited about unless you love orange. There is a clear version of the piece commonly used for SW ship lasers.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only one of two sets to obtain the new Sebulba figure. The printing is fantastic but the two grasping appendages are molded as one and doesn't quite look right. As an owner of the original Sebulba's podracer but not the new, this is a vast improvement.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Due to the symmetry the build, there is inherent repetition in the build. Nothing novel in the build process.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This does look like Sebulbas's podracer but the front where the wings connect looks a bit thin. The outside of each engine has a much more filled out look than the inside. Would have liked some string to use as control cables.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is probably best for those who want the improved Sebulba figure at a lower cost. The planet looks great with the various dirt and sand colors. The podracer is too slim in areas and the parts are not too interesting unless you desire orange. I don't think I could ever not recommend a Lego set but I could only recommend this at a discounted price.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3
