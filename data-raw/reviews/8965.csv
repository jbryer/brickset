"Ben_r_l","2012-02-22T18:14:18.03Z","Strategic Warfare!","<p>This set is a great addition to the Lego Games arsenal! Nowhere near as shallow as some of the sets in the theme.</p><p>I describe this game as pseudo-chess; There's plenty of strategy involved to best your foe. Movement is limited, but attack ranges certainly remind me of a few of the key chess pieces.</p><p>The rules and board layout seems perfect for setting traps and avoiding stalemates as you set up your pieces for attack, while covering yourself when your opponent moves! Some real time can be spent thinking where to move those especially key long-range units!</p><p><br></p><p>The game comes with a decent variety of 'additional rules' some of which I implemented straight away to flesh out the playtime and skill involved. For one of the rules you can even use the micro-chewbacca/Han Solo/etc. which are all welcome additional pieces! The model AT-ATs too are especially nice, worthy of any miniture collection.</p><p><br></p><p>If I had to fault this set it might possibly be in it's price, but that's looking at it as 'price vs No. of pieces' instead of 'price vs hours-spent-playing'. I also seem to break it apart by accident sometimes, but when playing on carpet I don't know any Lego game would fair much better.</p><p><br></p><p>I have a few of the Lego games and this one definitely stands out for me as the cleverest. I would recommend it with anybody, especially those sceptical about Lego Games.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Mr__Football","2012-04-22T02:28:20.837Z","Excellent Fun, Lots of Great Star Wars Microfigures","<p>This is an outstanding set that should be a part of every Lego Star Wars fan's collection. The game is a lot fun, and it comes with 32 great little Star Wars microfigures that you probably won't see anywhere else. Adding to that exclusivity is the fact that Lego won't be releasing this awesome set, which btw is the only Star Wars themed Lego games set to date, in the United States. Empire Strikes back is my favorite movie of all time so it was only fitting I had to add this to my collection. I'm in the States and had to order it off Ebay from a UK seller.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>HOTH!<br>Gameplay is lots of fun!<br></li><li>Star Wars Microfigures, 32 of them! Yes 32!<br>Fun to swoosh the little snowspeeders around the little At-At's<br>Exclusivity makes this one a surefire aftermarket hit<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Due to a licensing dispute, the game won't be released in North America.<br>US buyers must get them from overseas</li></ul><p><br></p><p>I'd love to see what kind of micro-sized MOC's I can come up with utilizing the cool Star Wars microfigures that come with this set. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"zipsforbananas","2012-07-17T06:30:11.817Z","Brilliant in every way!","<p>This is my first Lego game set, but the draw of the tiny little AT-ATs was enough to entice me!</p><p>This set is absolutely fantastic! The <b>micro vehicles</b> are delightful, and building them is really fun with the various clever techniques needed. Such tiny and intricate SNOT! The way the AT-ATs and the AT-ST are put together are really great, although I can't help but think the AT-ST could have done with a printed 1x2 flat plate for it's 'face'. And the tauntaun is just amazing! There are some interesting pieces, not least the 1x3 double inverted slope that I'm pretty sure is a brand new piece, and the orange and translucent 1x1 slopes are nice to have, and have spares of. The two 2x2 printed logo plates are nice too.</p><p>The collection of <b>microfigures</b> is great too, with a very decent number of troops and some great characters. I don't care that Boba never went to Hoth, I love having a micro version of him! And Chewie is outstanding - you just have to make a demented ""rawrgh!"" sound when you see his open mouth! And with minifigures being so expensive this feels like good value!</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, the biggest thing about this is the <b>gameplay</b> - Star Wars Lego that an adult can respectably play with!! (Yes, no matter your age you will end up going ""pew-pew!"" when you set you AT-AT to attack!)<br>It's a bit like chess, but so much more simple. I usually beat my wife at most games we play, but this is small enough that it can go either way, which is nice! The blend of attack capabilities in the vehicles, and their vulnerability make the game very interesting, with the most valuable pieces being the easiest to kill, and one set of the limited troops having the ""force hit"" where it might obliterate it's prey in one hit.</p><p>Being able to do two things per go (any blend of move and attack, just not moving twice or attacking twice with the same piece) makes it feel very tactical, but not at all complicated or cumbersome to play. You very quickly get used to the safe distance from each vehicle, anticipating attacks, and how risky each move might be. But the board is small enough that a perfect plan just isn't possible, so the game keeps moving and is always fun!</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>alternate board set ups</b> are really good too. The default is long and narrow so you take a while to engage each other, can plan your attack well, and the battle is intense because there's nowhere to go. The shorter board with space to the side adds a degree of importance to territory. And the short, fat board makes the game an instant, tense stand-off. It's quite surprising how differently each one goes!</p><p>And the <b>gameplay variations</b> are really good, with different vehicles - other ""force (half-)hit"" figures, gun turrets that can attack twice in a go; and different game play options - forfeit a go to bring a 'substitute' on to the field, double move rules to make the board seem smaller.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing that might be worth warning is that the game does seem to lend itself to expansion, but I think Lego have done very well in their own design. I added rows to the outside of the narrow board and made it so that all 6 vehicles could start, but it took the frantic element away and games became quite boring. The&nbsp;claustrophobic&nbsp;feel is part of why it works so well, so more space ruins it! Of course it can be modified, but I'd advise sticking to the official suggestions, or designing your extra elements carefully.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fantastic micro vehicles - every one of them is a gem!</li><li>A great set of figures</li><li>Clear, simple, but engaging gameplay</li><li>A huge amount of variation within the game, which adds hours to the playability</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I'd like a 3 or 4 player version, but seriously, can you imagine 4 player chess? And who would be the 3rd and 4th army anyway? :P</li></ul>
<p>This is a truly superb set! From the fantastic micro vehicles to the addictive fun and variety in the gameplay everything about this set is great. And somehow it makes my whole collection of Star Wars Lego seem bigger; it doesn't fit alongside the collection, it moves it from the display shelf into the pile of games! Slowly and surely Star Wars Lego is taking over my house...</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
