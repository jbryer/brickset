<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Easy to bulid.</p>
<p>Good for hours of playtime.</p>
<p>Has a funny name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Too easy to bulid perhaps? Don't we want to be challenged?</p>
<p>Doesn't look too cool from the side.</p>
<p>The name is a bit too ""Gangsta"" for my tastes.</p>
<p>It's a ripoff of Meltdown. It's true! Look!: [img]http://images.wikia.com/herofactory/images/6/64/Meltdown.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say get the origanal. It looks cooler and has a better name.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,2

<h4>Bag/Instructions</h4><p>I LOVE the new bags! There's just some exitment when you pick them up and look at them, doesn't make much sense, does it?</p><p>Instructions where fine.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This is an awesome parts pack! So many awesome pieces! Including his head, trans armor shells, green SP III flames, and round shoulder armor!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This build is accually pretty fun, it's not the normal humanoid type, it's&nbsp;more of a hunchback type build. You use some pretty awesome parts too!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Reapa here looks really Awe-err-EVIL! The only con is the lower half of his body is kinda bland.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I really like Toxic Reapa, he's a great parts pack or villain for any Bionicle or Hero factory fan... and for anyone who likes green!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
