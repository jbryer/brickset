"slovakiasteph","2012-01-02T10:54:27.857Z","Basic Build but some neat pieces","<br>I picked up this set at Wal-Mart the other day for $10-- I'd seen that they had some of the new Friends sets (all of the $10 sets and the Cafe) when I was in previously but had neglected to get one, so went back purposefully to get one for me and a friend.<br><br><h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Box/Instructions</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I like that the box is purple and not pink, anyway (a la Paradisa)!&nbsp; The back shows the front, basic scene broken down into smaller vignettes, as well as the five Friends characters and their sets.<br>
<br><h4>The build</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very simple build.&nbsp; I'd read a review of Olivia's Workshop, and that set seems to have a slightly more complicated build.&nbsp; All I had to do here was put the drawers/cabinet together, add legs and tile tops to the table and desk, and build the eight-piece inspiration board.&nbsp; Oh, there's a step-stool as well (Emma's standing on it, but it's partly hidden behind the table) and a round seat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't put the purple 1x2s on the bottoms of the table legs and desk because they seemed high enough already (2 bricks high, then a plate for the tabletops and tiles on top of that).&nbsp; They add a bit more visual interest, but it would be nice to work at a table without having to stand on a stool, no?<br></p><br><h4>
 Parts</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the pink and purple drawers, the laptop computer, MP3 player, the RULER, my favorite (which is printed, not stickered), and the translucent pink mug.&nbsp; There are also a few 1x2 tiles in various colors; I'm not sure what those are supposed to represent, perhaps fabric samples?<br>

 </p>

<h4><br></h4><h4>Minifigure</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Honestly, I like her and am slightly enamored.&nbsp; She's so cute that I had to show her to my brother (visiting over the holidays) and say ""look, isn't she cute?""&nbsp; Cute notwithstanding, I'm not sure what I'll do with the fig since she doesn't fit with the rest of my LEGO.<br><br>She was smaller than I'd expected; I guess after seeing so many close-ups of the new dolls, I didn't think she'd be so tiny!<br>
<br><h4>The completed model</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everything comes together cleanly and the set looks nice as a whole, although it does contain five smaller builds, so for an AFOL, they were a bit unsatisfying.&nbsp; Took me perhaps five minutes to build.&nbsp; Still, there's definitely some playability here as Emma can move about the room and work on her computer, eat the giant sandwich with green filling, sort through drawers, and work at her table.
<h4>Summary</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A cute but basic set.&nbsp; I think some of the other $10 sets will provide a slightly better value, but I like what this set accomplishes and like the purple and aqua pieces especially!<p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"wildwill","2012-01-05T20:18:15.827Z","Great new line for Kids - great starter set","I just picked this up at TRU for $11.99 - fortunately I had a $4 TRU Rewards, because I'd much rather pay $10. &nbsp;In any case, I allowed my 5 year old daughter to choose from the three sets that were in stock in this price point (the other two were the stage and the tractor type thing) and she really wanted this one because it reminds her of where her Mommy works (a coutourie shop).<div><br></div><div>The build is really quick, took all of five minutes for me, would have taken longer for her, but she's really enjoying all the different set pieces. &nbsp;I plugged them all into a small base and she's got a nifty little fashion design room now.</div><div><br></div><div>As an AFOL I can say this set is well worth it for adults too. &nbsp;There's some really nice color pieces here that hadn't been available before - and the small accessories are really top notch, especially the laptop computer and the camera. &nbsp;The laptop has been available before but not at anywhere near this price point, as all the previous sets it's been available in are at least $30 or more. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The one unique piece besides the mini-fig is the 4x6 plate with fashion design tampo, which is a lot nicer than if it had been a sticker. &nbsp;The 1x2 plate with no studs that has a musical pattern on it is only available in one other set. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you have a daughter these new Friends sets are a GODSEND, and we'll definitely be picking up more of them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"AETerry","2012-02-29T16:29:23.213Z","Emma's Fashion Design Studio Review","<p>This is another small set that I picked from Friends for myself as I am interested in some specific accessory pieces and mini builds found in this set.</p><p>My daughter of course has asked if we'll pick up another of this set like Olivia's Invention Workshop so she has her own and isn't getting the left over pieces that Momma doesn't want for her collection. I don't blame her.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>The instructions are in booklet form with clear step-by-step illustrations of this set in stages.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 79 pieces with this. Most notable are the camera and laptop pieces, the pink &amp; purple drawers, printed tile piece for an iphone or mp3 player and the design board. Given the range of colors with more turquoise bricks and some lavender 1x2x2 bricks, there's decent pieces to work with.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You have one Friends minidoll of Emma. She's fairly well detailed &amp; printed for the expectations of these minidolls. She has black hair that of course is compatible with regular LEGO minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The set is basically in stages.</p><p>*Design Board - this is fairly straight forward and not too elaborate.</p><p>*Chest of Drawers - Again, fairly straight forward and very utilitarian for drawers and storing the 1x2 tile pieces that act as bundles of fabric. <br></p><p>*Desk - I'll call it that as it's fairly high up, holds the brick burger on it and laptop.</p><p>*Design Table - This is probably the most elaborate of all of the mini builds, simply due to the small lamp build on it and all the accessory pieces placed here.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In all, while the ultimate set is rather simple and straight forward, there are a lot of little features and good minibuilds that hold a lot of appeal and interest. Granted I picked this up for a parts set, I am strongly considering a second of this set for my daughter as she loves the Friends line as a whole and finds a lot of enjoyment playing with them.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-26T12:08:55.52Z","Designing Fashions for all your Friends","<p>Set #3936 Emma's Fashion Design Studio: The 13.99$ sets from LEGO Friends, and no that is not a typo, in Canada these sets cost 13.99$ at TRU or 13.67$ at Wal-Mart. If memory serves. 1$ higher than LEGO's MSRP for the Friends Sets, it didn't used to be this way, some point during 2012, around summer or so the Friends sets went up in price at Wal-Mart. (TRU always had them that high price.) This price point places these sets around the same price point as the Ninjago Spinners, and while Ninjago Spinners don't have that many pieces and also include only one Mini-Fig, I think the value for your dollar is still better with these sets compared to the Spinners.</p>
<p>A lot of these single Mini-Doll sets are starting to remind me a lot of Hasbro's old Jem and the Holograms doll line. While it is typical to see teenage girls depicted as lovers of music, the performance arts in general and fashion design, the fact that these sets have a diverse group of Mini-Dolls designed to represent multiple ethnicities helps enhance the similarities. I could be reading too much into it though.</p>
<p>This is my third set with Emma, the Mini-Doll in this set is wearing an identical top design to Mia from the polybagged set I've gotten, this time it's purple and the design is slightly different with the detail prints. Instead of a sunrise with Butterflies you get Emma's customary flower design with Butterflies in different placements to the ones on Mia's shirt. She's wearing the same dark blue skirt we've seen on her before, only this time she's also wearing purple leggings and white socks. Yes I'm pretty sure these are socks and not some type of shoe, for one thing there is no printed detail on her feet which would usually be seen for shoes and the white color is pretty much knee-length. It makes more sense for her to be wearing socks while inside her own fashion design studio (presumably at home/in her home.) instead of shoes. (She's comfortable while she's desiging.)</p>
<p>There are 79 pieces in the set and they are used to great effect, while the models might be a bit on the simpler side as far as the builds are concerned, compared to say Olivia's Invention Workshop or even Andrea's Stage, they do look great and in a superb array of new colors. First up is the model that uses the most amount of actual pieces, the cloth dresser. It is mostly a place where some tiles are kept, all in different colors, meant to represent swaths/swatches of uncut cloth for Emma's designs, you have four pink drawers in two purple drawer holding pieces, each drawer holds one flat 1x2 tile ranging from light blue to dark red. Three teale bricks make up the bottom piece and a small light orange brush is resting off to one side&nbsp;on top of&nbsp;some new 1x3 smooth tiles in white. (More than likely a lint brush instead of a hair brush.) To reach the top drawers Emma uses a pink and white stepping stool. Overall a nice set piece.</p>
<p>Next we have Emma's easle, it uses nine pieces all connected and then the tenth new printed piece with all the drawings and designs Emma is working on. I love that it is printed instead of a sticker, that's one of the best aspects of the Friends Series of small sets, a lot of printed detailing in lieu of stickers.</p>
<p>The rest of the pieces make up two different desks and a small stool for Emma to sit on, the first desk is her design taple, wider and larger on top it features that great new ruler piece, a cleverly built desk lamp for working during the night, a small vase of flowers (this time the vase is only a teale colored roll instead of the transparent mini-fig head we saw in Olivia's Desk Polybag.) and a transparent dark rose mug/cup for Emma's coffee, or other beverage of choice. The instructions also tell you to place her camera and Ipod accessories here (the Ipod being the 1x2 printed tile piece instead of an actual Mini-Fig scaled accessory, maybe in 2013 LEGO will make an actual Ipod/Iphone for the Friends to use).</p>
<p>The second of the two desks is smaller, rectangular in size and uses the purple/pink stool for Emma to sit and work on her computer, hammering out the finer details of designing fashions. And seeing how it will all look in three-dimensions more than likely. Yes there is another computer in this set, a great way to get the laptop accessory first introduced with Series 7 CMFs. Emma is also eating a Krabby Pattie, well it's not really a Krabby Pattie, probably just a sandwhich with lettuce or something, but the build of the little food model does bear a resemblance to the builds found in LEGO SpongeBob sets.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a pretty good set, loaded with a lot of useful pieces, some decent looking models, a great Mini-Doll and some wonderful printed detail work. There's an extra stem, as always, for more garden delights and I'm a real fan of how LEGO is finding unique ways to use those older Skeleton Mini-Fig legs. I never would have thought of using it as part of a desk lamp, and yet LEGO has, and it doesn't look out of place or too odd, despite being a well known piece for Skeletons. I think the Friends Theme has been a pretty solid outing so far, and I have yet to take the plunge on one of the more expensive, larger sets. I do wish that the Mini-Dolls were given alternative wardrobe choices in these sets though, especially for the price being asked, at 13.99$ we're almost Battle Pack pricing and still only getting the one Mini-Doll figure. I guess because of all the new parts and things I should expect it to be pricey, still most LEGO City sets that only feature one Mini-Figure, at least usually feature some form of vehicle build for added playability. These sets, while great and highly reccomended for all the great colors, interesting new models and accessories, still feel like a bit pricey for what you're getting. To truly enjoy the models as part of a display and play idea you'd have to MOC your own building to put them in so the Friends Mini-Dolls aren't just all out in the wide open spaces working on fashions, performing concerts or building new inventions.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
