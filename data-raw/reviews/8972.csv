<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Additional hairpieces for the bride allowing blonde, brunette and black hair.</li><li>Good base with archway frames the figures well.</li><li>Bride figure has good printing and nice veil.</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Groom figure a bit generic and very similar to the magician from the collectable series</li><li>Price is a bit too high.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Overall this set is worth getting. </p><p>Yes the price is a bit high but then isn't everything wedding related? I would have preferred the groom to be in grey rather than black but the set is sure to put a smile on the face of whoever receives it and has&nbsp;many possiblities for customising for the happy couple. It says that it is for table decoration only but I'm sure it will end up on the top of many a wedding cake over the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"AETerry","2012-01-05T20:30:59.137Z","Wedding Favour Set","<p>This was rather exciting to see when LEGO put this out, the only real complaint is that it's a bit too expensive in my opinion. It's the perfect gift or collectible for any LEGO fan.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is small and like other specialty sets doesn't have its item number on it or a theme logo. Nice and yellow. Perfect for storing the set in for those so inclined. The instructions are basically a folded piece of paper, that like all LEGO instructions clearly show the steps with colored illustrations on how to assemble this set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's not a whole lot of parts to this set. I will note that for the bride, there are 3 different hair pieces to choose from and 3 different flower colors to give some customization and personalizing to.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You basically have a bride and groom. The groom seems rather generic or a dead ringer repeat for the Magician minifigure of series 1.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The trellis and stand for the minifigures to stand on is mainly cardboard with some adhesive for sticking the trellis and plate figures stand on to.<br><br>While cute, adorable, awesome or even neat... there's a huge amount of simplicity to this set, the most complex part of all of this is building the bride's dress.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, it's a great little set, but I can't help feel this is still a bit pricey, but not too much. It's perfect as stated before for a wedding gift or in a personal collection and for true &amp; serious collectors at that.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
