"perfectlydark","2012-06-23T01:09:50.14Z","My favorite Creator house","<p>I saw this a few months ago online and it sparked my interest, as I had recently begun collecting lego house models. At first the colour kind of put me off, but the more I looked at it, the more I wanted it. When I saw this in Toys R Us a few weeks ago, I grabbed it. (unfortunatly for $25 more than Big W will be selling it for this week :()</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun build. Its not hard or complicated, but this is a set built for playability. Rather than having my collectible minifigs in a boring display case, they are now partying it up at a costume party by the beach (with Surfer Girl hitting the waves!)</li><li><br></li><li>Great colour scheme. As previously said, I was at first doubtful, but not anymore. It looks king of like a weathered old sea blue beach house, the blue is a perfect fit. I am considering building another one in Tan or even Lime Green</li></ul><ul><li>Cost. I think its worth every penny personally, maybe not the best price per part, but certainly not overpriced, in my opinion. If you can get it for under $50AU, solid bargain (but even $60 I think is fair)</li></ul><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Built on large plates, rather than baseplates. Massive Pro for me, not a fan of <span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;baseplates, plus if you really wanted you can simply stick it on top of a large <span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; baseplate to form your little town</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Includes a minifig and surfboard! Good touch for a Creator set</div>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No internal or external furniture (excluding the BBQ). Maybe a chair or 2 would have just hit the spot</li><li><br></li><li>The BBQ frankly is not my favorite design. I know its supposed to represent a small, portable BBQ, but after the Hillside House BBQ, i cant go back. Sorry! Ill have to make another one of those for this house</li></ul><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Its probably just me but Im not a fan of the alternate designs. They just dont do <span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;it for me on this set</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, its one of my favorite sets OVERALL. Seriously, I love it. I intend to now start a seaside theme (grab a few lighthouses and harbor etc) all because of this one set. I love it so much more than the Log Cabin (which I also love), and even the Hillside House, which up until now was my favorite lego house. Grab it without hesitation, even if the colour seems weird at first, trust me, no other colour would do this set true justice. I must admit I havnt built any of the alternate builds (frankly im not really inspired by them) but the main design is worth 5 bricks :)</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"sayapone","2012-07-20T11:15:06.93Z","Excellent set to keep kids occupied","What sparked my interest in this set was that the rating it has on Lego website was 5/5 - heck even the modular building sets didn't have that kind of good rating!! Plus I got it for $35 so it was a real bargain:)<br><br>This is our first Creator set; so we were a bit surprised but pleased that it came with 3 manuals. I let my son pick the instruction he wanted and that kept him occupied for a good 30-45 minutes. <br><br>I love building Lego but I just hate ""fixing"" it - once assembled I prefer to leave my sets to collect dust in the display cabinet. With kids they have the tendency to tweak here and there.. it just drives me nuts when I couldn't find that small little piece to complete my set because my son used it for his makeshift dinner table! With this set I could let him take apart it all and rebuild over and over again.<br><br>The only issue is that every time the sets are completed there will be unused pieces which will need to be stored safely for the next build. <br><br>Other than that - two thumbs up for this set!<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"MaartenRF10","2013-08-07T15:21:24.433Z","Nice colours, not the best of Creator houses...","<p><b>Building</b></p><p>The Seaside House is an easy building to make. The part that takes most focus, is placing the tiles under the shower. Except from the rooftop window, it's fairly straightforward building. Building time is under one hour.</p><p><b>Appearance</b></p><p>The biggest pro of this item are the looks of it. The light blue coloured tiles are rather rare in Lego and fit this building well, especially in combination with the sand-coloured tiles of the beach. When looking at it, it do feel that it's a bit too packed with small things like fences, the tree, the sand castle and so. <br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Colour!<br></li><li>Surf dude's hair<br></li><li>The rooftop window can open<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Once you open the rooftop window, there's nothing to see! There's a lot of glass windows and doors to look through, but there's no interior. That's a shame...<br></li><li>Busy, it looks somewhat crowded with stuff.</li><li>Rather small.<br></li></ul>
<p>Nice looking building. Not the prettiest of the Creator houses (therefore it's too busy), but nice colour scheme.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
