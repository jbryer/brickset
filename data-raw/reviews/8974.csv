<p>Indeed &quot;Swamp Police&quot; would be more appropriate for this set given the 4x4 truck and the airboat.</p>

<p>The Unimog-style truck is an entertaining build and a number of cool play features, including utility bay and command centre with folding communications dish. It lacks a rooftop spotlight rack so you may wish to consider adding one.</p>

<p>The trailer is a pretty basic affair but hey who&#39;s going to wax lyrical about a trailer?</p>

<p>The airboat is a playability highlight; the build is pretty basic as it relies heavily on the floating black plastic base. However the two seats for the police officers give this one all the playability it needs. There are no fins behind the fan to control the boat but they are easily added if you&#39;re a pedant like me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a &quot;baddie&quot; but no &quot;baddie vehicle&quot; in this set so you will need to make your own arrangements for the criminal&#39;s transport. The box art suggests the robber can escape in the crate from the truck&#39;s utility bay, propelled by an oar, but that&#39;s hardly a fair fight against the airboat. An MOC speedboat and a recreation of the James Bond speedboat chase from &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is surely more appropriate.</p>

<p>Well worth the money. Enjoy.</p>

The boat is pretty cool and different enough from police boats, but the transport vehicle is VERY bland. Nothing else really to add, just another police set.</p>
