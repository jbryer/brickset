"Niallskie","2011-12-20T05:33:53.43Z","Playing catch up with Catwoman","<p>Got this set at our local Fred Meyer store with all the other available DC Universe Super Heroes sets. Much better is the price were not jacked up and even had a 10% discount on the entire purchase... AWESOME!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the whole&nbsp;Super Heroes&nbsp;sets, but this is the least of my favorite. I love the jetpack Batman was rocking in this set, though I do not like that Catwoman is riding basically the same bike as the previous Batman set. They could have mixed it up a bit like Batman is riding a bike while chasing Catwoman or something. Playability of this set is awesome,&nbsp;from the dropping traffic light, to the boxes that Catwoman can crash to,&nbsp;and the newspaper that can be tossed away while the chase is on. Another plus on this set is the newspaper is printed and not stickered. The mail box was ingeniously made, could not come up with something like this with the simplest of bricks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures are alright, Batman minifigure looks the same, I even think the torso print of the Batman minifigure in set&nbsp;6858 is better (Batman vs Catwoman set of 2006). On the other hand the new Catwoman torso print is better. Price is too stiff with this set, would have been justified with another minifigure as I think its possible. Not to compare but the Harry Potter set 4865 has 4 minifigures, and these minifigures are main characters.&nbsp;With everything thats been said, this set is a must have&nbsp;if you want to complete the Superhero set or if you are just looking for the Catwoman minifigure or even the Batman Jetpack.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4

SET # 6858 Catwoman Catcycle city Chase was the only set ,Besides the Batcave at the store i went to today! I got it and man is this cool! This is one of the first Lego Batman Sets to have the Blue Batman since the bat-tank Which I also have! This is obviously a remake of the Batman dragster Which I also have! However LEGO&nbsp;Tweaked&nbsp;it a bit. Instead of Batmans Dragster Batman gets a jetpack!(?) and Catwomans&nbsp;Motorcycle&nbsp;is still there, but is built different, even though the purple frame is seen once again! in replacement of the Batman dragster we get a street corner with a traffic light a mail box (I think) and a box of 2 (Printed) Newspapers! we also get 3 small boxes and two large boxes!</p><p>Also Batman gets a bat-a-rang. He only get ONE in most the new sets, which is a step up for this set but a step down for the rest!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Blue Batman In stead of Light Grey/Black Batman</li><li>Pro 2:&nbsp;Motivation&nbsp;for chasing Catwoman!</li><li>Pro 3: Nice City Corner setup with collection of boxes!</li><li>Pro 4: Jet Pack wings can be used for Batman's Gliding Cape!</li><li>Pro 5: Catwomans Eyes can also be seen through mask!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

"beegeedee","2012-02-08T07:02:18.083Z","Nice set, overpriced but fun all the same","<p>The Catwoman Catcycle City Chase is my second of the new Super Hero sets. I collect minifigures so this was the key selling point for me and always find it frustrating when some figures only come in expensive sets so this was key for me.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Nice box, quite small but probably could be smaller as is the case of most LEGO sets. The instructions are clear and can't be faulted.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>At 89 parts, it's not a huge set (that's 17c a part) but the set does come with 10 spares which is quite good for such a small set and it also has the catwoman bike chassis. However, the bike is mainly 2 parts and basically the same as the police bikes, except being purple of course. There are a few parts I've never seen before such as the little silvery cap for the jet on batman's wing and also there's another part that goes on the wing too (spares for both) but they are made from the cheap plastic often reserved for special parts. Also, 2 printed newspapers which are nice.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>2 Minifigures:</p><p>Catwoman's torso is printed front and back and is quite good. the head is also double-sided and one side has these white eyes that show through the mask but only look right if perfectly aligned. The other side doesn't work well unless you take hair from a different figure IMO - including a hair piece would have been nice.</p><p>Batman is the winged one and again printing on the torso is good and the grey looks right for the original batman colouring, printed both sides. It looks great although I'd have rather had a cloak than the molded wing. The head is double-sided but on taking off the mask you have this white bar both sides - no alignment problems though as a result but no use for/with a hair piece. really though, my main issue is the hat piece, while looking great is a little loose and comes off easily. His batterang is quite cool.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There are 4 main parts to this build.</p><p>The crates - straight forward enough counts for 10 pieces in the set. Pointless really.</p><p>The Catcycle. Takes about 2 minutes to put together and few pieces in the cycle itself, it being largely molded.</p><p>The Batman wing is 7 pieces, 8 if you include the wing itself. Again straight forward.</p><p>The street corner/light. This is where most of the build goes. It takes about 5 minutes to put together. I love the light and it's quite clever and purposefully unstable. The only downside is the top is quite loose but works regardless.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Not much to the model, but is quite good overall.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The EU price is quite expensive, depending on where you get it - it was 15.99 Euro from the local supermarket.</p><p>Wait for it in sale. That's my advise.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"AETerry","2012-01-20T21:43:48.453Z","Catwoman Catcycle Chase Review","<p>I recently picked this set up from the store and it is the second of the new 2012 Superhero Theme I've picked up. Given the size and price, it is very comparable to the <a title=""View full details of set 7779: The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7779-1""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7779 </span></a><strong><a title=""View full details of set 7779: The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7779-1"">The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit </a><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">set of 2006.</span><a title=""View full details of set 7779: The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7779-1""><br></a></strong></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's your standard cardboard box and the instructions are in booklet form with clear, easy to follow illustrations for each step. I did note that when building the City Corner piece with the signal lights, that steps 6 &amp; 7 have an error on them. Step 6 shows a round 2x2 black plate being placed and Step 7 has that piece missing while showing the placement of another piece.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 89 pieces to it and a few extra pieces. Notably extras of the ""claw piece"" first seen in the Prince of Persia sets and a new metallic grey 1x1 round tile piece. Printed 2x2 tile Newspapers, new whip, batwings for the jetpack.<br></p><p>Comparing this to the Batman Dragster set which has 92 pieces. You can see why I've took a point off the value as the Dragster retailed for $9.99 and this new set retails for $12.99. It's a clear show of inflation.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two minifigures in this set. One of Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman I noted that the print for the mask part of her face is a light blue tint instead of a silvery color from the previous Batman Dragster set she appeared in. Batman himself has a blue suit and makes me think of the old Adam West Batman series.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The overall build is basically in three stages. The first of which is Batman's jetpack. I love those new wings and want to get more of those. They are very awesome looking. This part of the build does make it different from the Dragster set.</p><p>The second build is for Catwoman's motorcycle and it's largely this piece that causes me to compare the older Dragster set to this one. You've got the theme of Batman chasing down Catwoman after one of her heists. This motorcycle is a bit different than her previous motorcycle in that there's no stickers to place on it for cat eyes. It's still purple and different placement of bricks. I'll say I like this newer motorcycle due to a lack of stickers.</p><p>The third build is for the street corner and all the boxes that set around it. On it's own, with no City/Town to put it in, this set would or could be boring. But it does create enough of a set piece for having Catwoman speed past it and Batman swooping in to tangle with her. I do like the Signal Light build. I just would have placed a fourth 1x3 yellow plate on the back and another row of signal lights there. Still this little build manages to convey a mood and atmosphere to the set and it's perfect to place in any existing City layout.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Obviously this set is great for those kids and collectors who missed out on the Batman LEGO sets the first time. There are enough different elements, pieces and builds that I don't feel let down like I'm buying a rehash of an older set. Besides, it would be nice to have more than one purple motorcycle rolling around in my LEGO City. And the wings for the jetpack, those I must say again, are just awesome. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"sitkawitka","2012-01-17T21:01:35.903Z","Super good super heroes set","I just recently got the catwoman catcycle city chase. I think its a great set! bat man has the gliding suit from the video game which I think is awesome. It's a small set but it provides hours of fun. There are a few bummers like cat woman's whip is brown not black. And her bike is almost the same as the one before. Now on to the mini figs I like that they designed bat man's head so that it looks like he is wearing a sweat band, it makes his head under neath not so creepy. Cat woman's head under neath looks like she's wearing shades. She has a face on the back that you can switch to her front and make her look like the movie one. There also is a traffic light that you can make fall on cat woman.And some boxes to make her crash into. so excellent set a few bummers though. &nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,2,5,2

This set was one of them and has by now surely sold out. I was lucky to get a few of them about 2 weeks ago. And it is fun, a very cool little set that will draw fans from all age groups I'm sure. It really doesn't matter if you'd rather fancy the play elements as a youngster or if you're in it for the figures alone. It delivers!<div><br></div><h4>The figures.</h4><div><b>Batman.</b> He comes in his grey comic outfit, which I think is nice. The hard plastic wings for his jetpack is a truly cool element that brings memories back from the LEGO Batman video games. Both the wings and his cowl has a nice blue colour that suits his suit perfectly. Double sided faces are mandatory for most superhero minifigs, and this Batman is not an exception. Included are two batarangs, which is always nice to have.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Catwoman.</b> She just looks cool, all dressed in black. She does have some torso printing, which is nicely done. In this set she has supposedly stolen a diamond (based on the small ""comic"" included) so she's got that to go along with her brown whip. Her mask bears her signature of being a cat and it looks awesome.</div><h4>Bike and street corner.</h4><div>I'm not quite sure what to say of her purple motorcycle. Maybe LEGO intended for it to be cat-like with the black elements, but it doesn't work for me I'm afraid. It is nice in a way, since it matches Catwoman's colours. There is even a place to keep her whip and diamond when she's on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>The street corner was a small but very cool element. You get an action traffic light, news paper stand with brick newspapers and 5 boxes to enhance the crash waiting to happen as Batman swings his batarangs on the traffic light! It is a great design, in my opinion. If you have the parts to spare, this set clearly shows you how to make multiple traffic lights and other street corner mikrobuilds. Well done with the inspiration, LEGO!&nbsp;</div><h4>The complete model.</h4><div>This just looks great as a display piece.

"Berrus_Brickus","2012-02-27T17:23:18.033Z","Cuh, cuh, cuh, cuh, Catwoman!","<p>This is one of two Super Heroes sets I got for Christmas, the other being 6864 Batmobile and the Two-Face Chase. This is currently (as of&nbsp;February 27, 2011) the smallest of the Super Heroes line, and pretty much a remake of 7779 The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit, which also featured Catwoman on a motorcycle fleeing from Batman. </p>
<p>[img]http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090412233026/lego/images/6/6e/Batman_set.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>7779</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't find a picture small enough of 6858 to post into a review. Please maximize the image at the side if you wish to compare the two.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The dark blue box shows the scene of Batman chasing Catwoman down a street with newspapers flying, crates upturned, and a stoplight plunging perilously towards Catwoman.&nbsp;The DC Universe and SUPER HEROES logos&nbsp;are at the top of the front. There is a cartoony picture of a blue suited Batman in the upper right hand corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a 1:1 scale image of Batman without the jetpack at the top of the box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The back of the box gives pictures of how the stop-light drops and a less exciting image of the set. Both pictures are against a bright yellow backdrop, which I'm not so fond of, but it's not the front of the box at least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instruction book has the same image as the front. The inside has a nice light blue background, and you can easily tell between black and gray pieces now, black pieces have a white outline which makes a nice difference, not that there are too many pieces to mix up here. Even though a comic isn't included, there is a short comic in the back of the instructios, which I really don't understand. In the back, there are ads for LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, the three DC Ultrabuilds, and for the LEGO Club. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set includes 89 pieces which is <em>okay</em> for a licensed set of this size. Of the five molded parts I've noticed which are exclusive to sets in the DC Universe line, this set has two-Batman's ""wings"" and Catwoman's cowl (which has the eyes closer together than before). Besides the wings and cowl, Catwoman's new face and torso, as well as the two printed newspapers are included. As for rare parts, there is a Hassansin claw (as well as an extra), Catwoman's whip, the purple motorcycle (only the second set to include this), the new 1x1 round piece in silver (and another extra one), and the Transparent diamond is not so common for smaller sets. </p>
<p>There are no stickers included. </p>
<h4>Minifigures </h4>
<p>There are two minifigures included-Batman and Catwoman. The minifigures are probably the main draw, and both are great and very detailed. </p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Batman&nbsp;<br/></strong>Batman has an Earth Blue cowl, which was previously exclusive to the two Batman sets from 2007. The face is okay, but looks too much like Superman's, only younger and with a white headband. The head is double sided, with a scowl on one side and a large smirk on the other. If it wasn't for the smirk (which reminds me of the campy Adam West Batman), I would actually prefer the original face to this one. I like the torso more than the original, mostly because it has my favorite Batsymobol with the rounded appearance and yellow background and backprinting. The jet-pack is really spectacular with the batwings, I only wish we could get them in Black (for a Man-Bat I'm hoping to make) and uses some rare pieces like the new 1X1 round plate, a Hassassin claw, and an old SNOT piece which I've never had a lot of. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catwoman <br/></strong>Catwoman was one of the first Super Heroes minifigures we saw back at Comic-con, and as many people pointed out, she hasn't changed too much. I both love and hate this Catwoman. First of all, the eyes on her cowl are closer together, so she can actually see out of the eye holes without her eyes being really far apart (when the side of the head with the normal eyes is looking out) and her feminine curves don't cut through her shoulders like the original, something I always hated. However, I don't like her face. I was excited that her visor would give her the appearance of having white Comic-book styled eyes, unlike the original's silver, but I was disappointed to find that they're light blue with white printing at the top, which gives a weird effect. I would of preffered either solid blue, or solid white. Also, Catwoman's smirking lips are the same as Poison Ivy's and Harley Quinn's (save for colour, and Harley's are mirrored). I really would of liked her to have a more unique expression. </p>
<p>Things to note about the new Catwoman: </p>
<ul>
<li>Double sided face (normal eyes and comic book eyes) <br/>
<li>The original also had a double sided face <br/>
<li>Backprinting <br/>
<li>Cowl with eyes closer together<br/></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>First, you build Batman and his jet-pack, then Catwoman and her motorcycle, and lastly, the street corner. There really isn't anything to be learned, and as you would probably expect, the build is easy. The mailbox, jetpack, and traffic light are all done really well though. This is not a set to get for building experience. The traffic light is incomplete as it only has three sides. I wouldn't care if this didn't leave a blue plate exposed at the back.</p>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4>
<p>This is one of those sets that you'd get for the minifigures, not so much to model. However, I'm sure younger children could have a blast having Batman chase Catwoman around the house. I like the motorcycle and jet-pack, and I'm sure that they'll find uses in the displays I'm planning. The street corner is a little less satisfying, it uses a large triangle piece rather than a couple 2xwhatever plates as I thought. If it wasn't for this triangle piece, it would of been easier to connect to a City, and it pretty much foils my plan of connecting it to the bank in 6864 Batmobile and Two-Face Chase. </p>
<p>And before I forget, the falling trafic light is a very good idea for a playfeature in a small set, because it isn't something you see to often, but I don't really like it, Catwoman is really going to be hurt when that falls on her…</p>
<h4>Summary </h4>
<p>This is the kind of set that you'd get for the extremely well done figures (even though I have a few nit-picks about Catwoman), when I first built them, I couldn't believe how much detail was on minifigures, it pretty much blew away my Harry Potter minifigure collection which I thought was incredibly detailed. Now they only seem detailed. If you already own 7779 The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit and are pleased with your Catwoman, I wouldn't recomend this set, unless you are after Batman's jet-pack and the newspapers. I would recomend this to somebody interested in the figures, newspapers, and jetpack. Otherwise, skip it.<br/></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-02T18:02:51.047Z","An Update and a Half","<p>Set #6858 Catwoman Catcycle City Chase: That's a lot of Cs. There have been many reviews of this set, and some have even compared it to the original Batman Dragster Catwoman Cycle set, so I'm going to review this set on its own merits and try to compare as little as possible.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately springs to mind with this set is the great lack of stickers. And the use of almost the exact same number of pieces to make a completely different looking version of Catwoman's Cycle. It's still built pretty much the same way with the same basic chasis and undercarrige, however the details in the design have changed. It looks pretty good actually.</p>
<p>This set is a very different monster from the original, instead of two vehicles there is only one and then the rest of the peices build a set piece/street corner element. All I've got to say is that Gotham has a really big problem with empty crates everywhere, you've got two crates and three bricks as well as the flat 2x2 square tile in brown to make up a pile of crates for Catwoman to crash into. (Or Batman to leap off of them and glide after Catwoman to prevent her escape.) The street corner has playability with the way it's designed so that you can pretend Batman has knocked the light off the pole and onto Catwoman's head. (Only in Comic Books would a street light come down so easily though.)</p>
<p>The little mailbox and newstand with printed Newspaper elements is a neat little addition, the Mini-Figures are both great too. Catwoman is much more defined in her print, it pops out with purple outline changing the dynamics of the figure, the cowl piece has also been redesigned. She has a double-sided torso print and two different prints on her head. One masked with the cat's eyes and the other with Selina's eyes visible. Even her expressions are more vibrant and detailed compared with her original, and this time she get's a much better whip (though it really should have remained black.) as well as the jewel she has stolen.</p>
<p>Batman's Mini-Figure is sweet looking, based on a more recent costume in the comics apparently, and not the Adam West look from the 60's, it's a dark blue with gray, the utility belt and bat emblem are of course yellow in color. And he's got some abs on him. His torso is double-sided for the print, unfortunately the large solid plastic wingpack kind of hides this from him. The wing shaped flight pack is built out of LEGO pieces, and features a brand new solid plastic cape style piece. I love the look of it as it sort of matches the glide pack from the original LEGO Batman video game. He has the same two-sided head that every Batman Mini-Figure in 2012 comes with and a blue cowl, as well as two Batarang accessories.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great set, at 14.99$ A lot of stores have raised the price to 15.99$ in Canada and TRU has marked it up to 17.99$ which is pathetic. This set is not worth 18$, not by a long shot. Get it on sale at other stores, or even regular price at other stores and you'd be much better off. The new Batman and Catwoman Mini-Figures are great fun, and the jetpack Batman has, while not as impressive as the Dragster was originaly, is still a fun addition. As a bonus you recieve two claw pieces from the Prince of Persia Theme, one of them fits on Batman's Jetpack as one of the pieces, the other Catwoman can use to simulate claws. (When she's not escaping on her bike.) Really good set LEGO, and a great way to get the new Batman Mini-Figure, of course you'll still need to buy one of the larger sets to get the cloth cape.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Batman:</strong> The second-best minifig in the set. He's the same as the blue Batman that you get in 6857 and 6860, but without a cape (it would've been nice if they included a spare cape.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Catwoman:</strong> M-e-o-w! So far, this is the best female minifig of the year (tied with fellow villainess Poison Ivy). Her black suit goes well with the purple highlighs, and the curves on her add to this feline beauty. Her cat mask also works really well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vehicles:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Catwoman's ""Catcycle"":</strong> The main vehicle of this set. The purple-ness is ""purrfect"". It includes a holding place for her whip and the stolen diamond. The tail at the end is a nice touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Batman's Jetpack:</strong> A nice nod to Batman's gliding cape in ""Batman Begins"". It's nice to see the return of the claw&nbsp;piece that first appeared in PoP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Street Corner:</strong>&nbsp;A nice touch that the original Catwoman set didn't have. I love the newstand and mailbox. The feature of the falling streetlight works really well.</p>

The mail box it a nice little build and the street light is too much fun, though the exposed technic bar stands out a little it can easily be fixed, The boxes included are just the cherry on top! I can see kids loving this set because of all of the playability it offers. The Catwoman and Batman figures look great, No complaints at all about them other than the smiling side of Batmans' head, Considering when he wears the suit he rarely smiles. but that's a tiny nerd nitpick for you, most others shouldn't be bothered by that. But one thing that was disappointing was that his regular cape was not included, I like the little backpack but having the option of both would be great!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4><div>1: The great set piece included just makes it all come together. It's a lot of fun and looks great!<br>2: The dual sided face of Catwoman is a plus for many reasons, You can make her wear the mask with her eyes exposed for a different costume. Say for example her mask from the movies.&nbsp;<br>3: The printed newspaper will come in handy for those who create vignettes as will the mailbox and street light.<br>4: The extra pieces are useful, 1 red,light blue, green and yellow transparent stud, 1 light gray flat round stud, 1 black and transparent 1x1 roof tile, 1 blue connector peg with knob, Light Gray T-bar, Extra Batarang, Extra ""Wolverine"" claw.</div>
<h4>Cons</h4><div>1: Catwoman's catcycle looks a bit...silly.<br>2: Batman doesn't come with a normal cape, while the backpack is cool a lot of people want complete Batman minifigures. Myself being one of those people.<br>3: The set is difficult to track down, be prepared to buy online and pay a little more than what it actually sells for.<br><br>And with that I bring this lengthy review to an end by saying I'd like to see more set pieces like this in the future, ones with more small details added to them, and more interactivity included. This set is truly great. It includes many cool pieces and really sparks the imagination, you may end up paying more than you'd like to but It's worth it.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set was the smallest regular retail DC set when it came out. It came in a small box, and I believe it had the thumb-punch feature. The front shows the set in action, the back shows the features. The instructions are fine, and I think they included a small comic at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some neat parts, like the printed newspapers, Catwoman&#39;s purple bike fairing, and Batman&#39;s glider pack.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes what was then the latest-and-greatest Batman and Catwoman figures. Batman has his standard blue costume, with a glider-jetpack thing in the shape of bat wings. His head has two alternate expressions, which is useful. Overall, I like him, but it would have been nice if he came with a cape to swap out for the glider. Catwoman also has some good printing, as well as a double sided head. She comes with a diamond and a whip.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is very simple. You snap the fairing and wheels on the bike, add a few parts to the back of it, and then build the basic street corner.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is very nice. Catwoman&#39;s bike has a cool &quot;tail&quot; on the back, and the stoplight has a smashing action.&nbsp; I get that the point is to have Catwoman smash through all the boxes, but it is a bit annoying to have them all floating around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a good impulse buy that gives you some high-quality and instantly recognizable. It is nowhere near the greatness of the 2006 Dragster set, but this set is still good in and of itself. A good entry point for DC fans.</p>

"AvengingBlade","2016-10-22T15:32:14.523Z","Nice small build","<p>This is an excellent little set and provides great minifigs. The batman&nbsp;with jet pack is a great addition to any batman collection. His jetpack&nbsp;is well built and sturdy. Batman can stand on his own with the jetpack which is excellent. Cat woman is a great villain and I am happy they included this particular villain in this set. The traffic light&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;street corner are excellent. The corner is great to put in any city and is very realistic. The street light has an action feature where the traffic light falls off the post and can fall onto catwoman. &nbsp;The only disappointment is catwoman&#39;s cycle. It is just a few pieces and lacks any real building.&nbsp;This is a great set for the value and I fully recommend it.</p>

"richieb24","2019-07-13T04:15:59.18Z","Small but good","<p>Build</p>

<p>Small but Nice, I do like the purple bike, Traffic light, and news paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Not very interesting except for the bike and wings</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>The Catwoman&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;is very nice except for the cowl which is kinda weird but looks like something from a comic. The Batman is very nice except for the fact that he doesn&#39;t come with a cape.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pretty good set but $12.99 is kind of expensive.&nbsp;</p>
