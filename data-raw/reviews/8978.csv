 Just before I start with the build, I would like to mention one thing. This set has not yet been officially released, so in other words you probably can't go to your local retailer now and purchase it, because it's going to be released in 2012. I got this set at Toys ""R"" Us, which seems to be a good place to buy unreleased sets. If you don't have access to a local Toys ""R"" Us, either from your country or city, you can simply go to: <a href=""http://www.toysrus.com"">http://www.toysrus.com</a> (.au) and purchase it there.</p><p>
 Now on to the build. I reckon the build was pretty fun, just because of how simple and small it was. I know this might sound stupid, but that's how I would put it. Yeah it was pretty decent and I like the idea of re-releasing the ""Batman"" theme with the new pieces and figures. The build was really organised and this set also came with a comic. Now I think that's not a bad idea at all to advertise the other sets, but what irritates me is how they put a massive bold righting with arrows to it on the box for something that's not really worth mentioning on the packaging. Yeah I might be exaggerating a bit, but it seriously does, mainly because it's only 5 pages and most of that is just ads for the other sets, so I don't think that was a necessary call. The instructions have not yet been available on LEGO's site, so instead I'll include a specific link from Toys ""R"" Us: <a href=""http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12326410&amp;prodFindSrc=search"">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12326410&amp;prodFindSrc=search</a></p><p>
 The figures though are pretty awesome. They all have back printings and well i guess you could say 2/3rds of them have double sided heads. Now all I can say is only 1 figures is exclusive so far. The Batman figure also comes in set 6864 and the Joker comes in set 6857 which has not yet been released. So the only exclusive figure in this set is Joker's goon, which might sound a bit strange. The figures though are definitely a big step up from the previous version of this set which was set 7782. In that set, none of the figures actually had back printing and none of the figures were unique. Also none of the figures had a double sided face, which was a little odd. So the figures in this newer set are by far much better and I like how they designed Joker's bang gun with the flag, it's a pretty smart way of doing that. The thing that made me really happy about this set, is the step up from the original, to the newer henchmen design. Now in the previous model, the henchman was just a guy with no printing, a beanie hat, sunglasses and some stubble. The newer one though has the clown mask, which is of course a lot more accurate and more specific and I like how they didn't just use the same face for all the henchmen, which you can obviously tell from the other henchman in set 6864. He also has a very awesome back print and it has a picture of Joker, so again it shows that it's more specific. Check out the parts, counter parts, stickers, figures, extra parts etc: <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=6863-1"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=6863-1</a></p><p>
 I really like the vehicles, but not by how small they are. If you look at this Bat-Wing and then at the previous model, you can easily tell that the original is much bigger. I don't know why every time LEGO does a re-release they always tend to make the model smaller, or in other words shrink them down in size. Same goes for the helicopter. I think they just went beyond on making this more simple and the problem is it has made all the play features are limited. Same with the helicopter, the play features are fairly limited. Even the ladder on the helicopter has shrunk. Now, for this set being owned by me, I would accept that, but whenever I look at the older one, it makes me wonder why they did this and there is not a real good answer to this. The Bat-Wing doesn't even come with a stand, but I guess since this model is like WAY smaller, it would be silly if they made a stand for it. Another thing that irritates me is how they make flick fire missiles there main play feature. Now that's mainly one of the reasons why I gave the playability a 3, it's because all the play features revolve around the basic missile action, which might seem okay with younger kids, but definitely not for me. Check out more on the previous model: <a href=""http://guide.lugnet.com/set/7782"">http://guide.lugnet.com/set/7782</a></p><p>
 So, lets start with the helicopter. The front has a cockpit and seat for 1-2 mini figures. There are also some controls and levers in there.</p>
<p>
 On the front, is Joker's laughing bomb. Yeah it says to flick fire it, but I think it's meant for a bomb, because that makes more sense. The round piece on the front is actually a smiley face and that's a unique printed piece. To launch it, you have to push on a lever on the back side and it launches pretty well.</p>
<p>
 On either side, there are 2 flick fire missiles, which are supposed to be like extra weaponry. Unfortunately, unlike the original the missile rack doesn't actually fold in, which is kind of lame.</p>
<p>
 There is also a tiny ladder on the side (I barely even noticed it existed until I got it) and it's okay, but it kind of looks weird just because of how small it is.</p>
<p>
 At the very top, there are 3 propellers. It spins fairly smoothly and each individual flap is on a stiff joint that can rotate up and down.</p>
<p>
 The back it has a ""J"" sticker on this wing piece. This sticker appears to be the same one used on the original version. There is also a ""beam"" used to attach the tail on, so I think that's a cool idea.</p>
<p>
 Now for the Bat-Wing itself. The front has an opening cockpit and there is a seat for Batman. There is not storage or anything for his Batarang like the original, however you only get one Batarang unlike the other sets where you got a whole set of them.</p>
<p>
 Towards the back of the cockpit, is a sloped piece that's on a hinge. Underneath that, is a button. If you press that, a tiny bomb piece will fall out from the bottom. (Although this may not be a bomb, I might be mistaking). To reload it, you have to stick the bomb on the bottom of the ship, where the other end of the button is located.</p>
<p>
 On either side, you have your wings that you can push up, just like the original version. The wing is on a stiff joint and it can sometimes brake, so just heads up on that. Underneath there is a flick fire missile.</p><p>
 PROS:</p><p>- Easy to build, great for younger kids</p><p>- Good for play and display, it looks fantastic</p><p>- Lots of new parts and figures</p><p>- Pretty good value for money, also a good investment considering how the previous ""Batman"" theme is so expensive</p><p>
 CONS:</p><p>- Not that challenging...</p><p>- Looks kind of unfinished in parts</p><p>- Both vehicles could of been a bit bigger</p><p>- The wings on the Bat-Wing are very fragile... they brake off constantly when you try to move them</p><p>- Could of had at least 2 or more printed pieces, since there is only one printed piece and everything else is a sticker</p><p>- Could of came with at least couple more guns-since Joker only has one gun and it's the bang gun which is supposed to be fake...</p>
<p>
 All in all, it's a good set to pick up, especially for younger kids. Not really for the teenage kids, mainly because the build is way too easy. If you want to save up for something better though, save up for the original version of this set. It's better in a lot of ways; better size, better piece count, better playability etc. It might be more expensive, but at least you know it's much bigger and better, but that's up tp you to decide. The main attraction to this set is mainly the figures...</p><p>If you want more of my opinion on this set, go to my You Tube channel, it's where you can watch my reviews on all sets I own: http://www.youtube.com/user/legoreviewer778</p><p>If this review was helpful to you, press ""yes""!&nbsp;</p>

"Niallskie","2011-12-18T04:31:13.69Z","Chase is on... AGAIN.","<p>Just built this set and I'm off to do the review right away. I was happy to aquire this set at a local store without the mark up other store's do, and earlier that I have actually expected. The price is not actually bad for the set, more for the lego fans in that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I opened the box, saw the big comics inside. I did thought that it's a new comic, but to find out its the same comic that was with 6862 set which was alright, still no backing board to keep the instruction or the comics straight. Minifigures are awesome, ofcourse... Batman (does look like the&nbsp;Batman Minifigure in set 7781 with an improved utility&nbsp;belt)&nbsp;and Joker i would say is a big improvement, torso print looks amazing, hair piece is better and face looks more devious. I love&nbsp;both main character, but what&nbsp;did surprized me was&nbsp;the hench man minifigure, well more than Jokers previous hench men by all account. The lime green torso with the print makes this hench man cool, the face print does make this minifig stands out as jokers hench man. This set has only 8 big stickers which is alright by me, though it would be better if they were prints. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just questioning how come they did the same pairing with the DC universe set like the Batman set. I mean Batwing vs. Joker Chopper, Batmobile vs. Two Face Bank Armor Truck. They could have did the Batwing vs. Two Face, etc... then again who am i to complain. Both the Batwing on this set and the Chopper is a fantastic build, ofcourse they are both smaller compared to the 7782 set as brick pieces is just half of the other set. I do think the Joker Chopper looks better, much stealthier&nbsp;than the previous chopper, but the hidden rockets on 7782 is much better. One thing&nbsp;I also love about this set it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the megaton bomb thats is in front of the Chopper, I do love that it has the Joker face.&nbsp;Batwing also is half the size of 7782, same gimick on how the other wing flips up to reveal rockets. This set would have been more awesome if it has even a simple Batwing stand, but then it is awesome as it is. Im sure nobody can argue that the&nbsp;releasable mini Batwing or tracker is&nbsp;a winner, simply built but masterfully designed.&nbsp;Playability is fantastic on this set, specially for kids. Must have specially for the holidays for gifts and adult collectors. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Snowtrooper119","2012-02-25T02:46:34.443Z","review of Batwing battle","<p>This set is a good set that, even though it is a remake of a very similar set from a few years ago it is well worth the money. It may have a smaller and arguably inferior batwing but the joker-Copter is definitely superior to the previous version and the set has better looking&nbsp;minifigures than the previous version. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The comic book</h4>
<p>The comic book is nothing to get excited about. It has scenes from the catwoman set and the super man set with a page of DC universe minifigures and the at the back it has a comic of a dogfight between batman and the Joker. There is no dialogue and the comics are very short so don't get excited about the comic.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Batman: Is a&nbsp;fantastic minifigure. His detailing is simple yet effective and the head piece and cape look great. The head is double sided with wo faces that both capture an expression Batman would use. The batarang then&nbsp;completes the Batman. </p>
<p>Joker:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Joker is a great minifigure that captures the crazy clown&nbsp;perfectly. He has his trademark purple suit, green hair and maniacal grin&nbsp;that maketh the clown. he also has his joke flower on his vest. Like batman he has a double sided head that do a good job of showing the Joker's personality.</p>
<p>Joker's henchman: This henchman is the best henchman minifigure&nbsp;I have ever seen. Not only does he have joker face paint but he has back printing with the joker's face on it. This definitely raises the bar for henchman-type minifigures in the future. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The batwing and the Joker-Copter</h4>
<p>These two vehicles were fun to build and the end result is quite good in my opinion. They both have four stickers each but they aren't that difficult to apply so were not a problem. The batwing is meant to look like a bat from the top and does succeed albeit a blocky one while the joker-Copter has a gunship feel to it due to the flick-fire missiles (4)&nbsp;on the sides. The Copter also has&nbsp;a toxic laughing gas bomb mounted a the front while the batwing has hidden flick-fire missiles (2)&nbsp;under the wings as well as a bat-missile which functons as a bomb (I know it is a missile because the comic book illustrates the missile flying towards the Copter). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall rating</h4>
<p>I think that this is a really good set with&nbsp;great minifigures, a fantastic Joker-copter and a good Batwing. It is worth the money but may not be for those who got the previous version. i reccomend this to all Batman fans and fans of helicopters, interesting looking jets and clowns. </p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,4

"Nesquik","2013-03-21T18:26:39.317Z","""Sometimes I could just kill myself!""","<div>The transfer of mid-2000's 'Batman' product line to a sub theme of 'Super Heroes' was a fantastic decision, as this has opened up many more possibilities for how our caped crusader integrates into the DC Universe.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This being said of course, a Batwing and Joker helicopter has already been released in the past; 7782 was the first iteration of this very product. But being a huge fan of the 1989 smash hit 'Batman' (which starred Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the hero and Joker respectively), this was one product that I couldn't pass second time round. I should also point out that this is one of the few Lego Batman products to tie in closely with not just a particular movie, but also a scene from it, and that is makes the product equally special.</div><div><br></div><div>'Batwing Battle Over Gotham City', even without my bias for the movie itself, is simply a fantastic set that balances playability and authenticity well. In this respect, it is suitable both as a toy and as a model for display.</div><div><br></div><div><b>7782 vs 6863</b></div>This 2012 offering of the Gotham City battle has attracted some criticism due to its downscaling, but in all honesty, it's not justified in any way. I can't understand it.<div><br></div><div>I may hazard a guess that many owners have not seen the 1989 Batman movie (which is understandable as it is not for children) that these crafts are inspired by, and if that is indeed the case, then I can appreciate some frustration.&nbsp;However, the new designs are <i>far</i> more faithful to their movie counterparts in terms of proportions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, the scale of the Batwing in this set doesn't quite match the epic nature of that which is seen in film, but designers have made the right choice by enhancing the playability over authenticity. If the Batwing was indeed 'to scale', it would be incredibly fragile, cumbersome and wouldn't integrate well with other Batman products. This is no different to how the Star Wars X-Wing Starfighter, though meeting similar proportions to its original designs, is quite a bit smaller than what we see in the movie.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would also guess that any complaints arise from the&nbsp;<i>""if it's smaller, then it must be worse!"" </i>syndrome<i>. </i>If one compares 7782 to the Batwing from the movie, then they will appreciate just how bad the model actually looks.</div><div><br></div><div>(Footage below)</div><div><br></div><div><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUqGwnAolSs</i><br><div><br></div><div>6863 is clearly superior.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Build and Play</b></div><div>The Batwing itself is a beautifully compact and intricate model, which is all the more amazing with the modest piece count. The back-wings have the ability to move up, though I personally don't think it looks very good in this mode (its inclusion is again there for playability). Batman can <i>lay </i>inside the cockpit, though if you're planning on having this model on display, leave him out as his cape will get creased. The lack of studs to keep in him place would seem unfortunate, but it's a tight fit anyway so he won't roll around.</div><div><br></div><div>Then we have the Joker's helicopter - a real gem which makes a change. I've never been a fan of Lego helicopters for the simple reason that they always look awkward, but in licensed themes such as Super Heroes, the designers can get away with some more wacky designs. This 'copter is amazingly faithful to the movie, and has some really details such as the rope ladder.</div><div><br></div><div>Both of these crafts are solid builds, the latter even more so. The only potential for damage with the Batwing are the two back wings on their hinges, but providing you move these up and down with moderate force, they're not going to break off at all. Anyone who does complain about 'flaws' such as this are too heavy handed, in my honest opinion.&nbsp;<br><div><br></div><div>The colours used for each model are absolutely excellent, with almost all of the components in the Batwing in black and yellow, while the Joker's 'copter includes purples, greens, reds and greys. Both make a stark contrast of one another, but equally look tremendous. They set each other off perfectly!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Flicking everywhere...</b></div><div>I don't know if I've missed something, but why have 'flick missiles' suddenly invades Super Heroes and Star Wars? If they added lots of value to the playability then I can understand this, but I fear the designers are at times going overboard. Not only is Joker's 'copter equipped with four and the Batwing two, but each craft also has a bomb! I'm guessing this product, they've been included to balance the odds of the battle during play, but the discreet bombs actually look great. The flick missiles meanwhile just look like... flick missiles.</div><div><br></div></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><div>As with most licensed products now, the first thing children and adults consider are the minifigures. The Lego Group has seemingly made a nod to this by displaying artwork of each included minifigure on the bottom of the packaging, though this only reiterates how unimportant models can be, sadly. In the case of 6863, both the minifigures and models make an equal impression, so I'm happy to have the whole product on display.</div><div><br></div><div>In this set, we get what I call 'Tim Burton' Batman, who sports an all black suit and cowl, muscle definition and a yellow logo and utility belt. Again, the colours are totally striking and it's great to have a minifigure of this memorable film character.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Joker meanwhile is a bit less interesting, if only because he's almost identical every time he crops up. This isn't a bad thing necessarily as that's just his look, but the benefit of this set is that you're getting not just Batman, but arguably his best arch nemesis in one product. His green hair, garish teeth and bright purple and green costume is wonderful (if also pushing creepiness...) He also gets to hold a nice gun with a flag on the end, which is a reference to the moment in the bell tower when he shoots himself.</div><div><br></div><div>Joker's henchman is an absolute joy - his face is a sadistic clown with whitened skin and big lips. The clothing is basic, but on his back he sports a 'Joker' graphic which is fantastic and so unusual.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both the Joker and Batman have double-sided faces.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><div>At £35, this yet another licensed product that aims to test our wallets more than anything. With only 278 pieces and 3 minifigures, a £25-£30 price bracket is certainly more reasonable, and in-line with what you would expect from TLG's in-house product lines. At the current RRP, I would definitely expect either one more minifigure (perhaps another henchman?) or a microbuild to compliment the two crafts.</div><div><br></div><div>Pricing aside, I can't recommend the product highly enough. I have no doubt that film fans will appreciate the nature of this set more than children, for the movie is purposefully dark; the Joker being a sadist. This is another reason why I'm glad The Lego Group have designed Super Heroes as one product line, because they are able to reference elements of these movies whilst also making them safe for children. That's incredibly important, as both Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan's Batman movies can be violent affairs.</div><div><br></div><div>But even without the backstory, this is still a lovely build that has been designed for maximum playability and no strict narrative. Both crafts make excellent 'swooshers', and are equally balanced as a hero/villain by containing weapons and figures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"Berrus_Brickus","2012-02-25T11:32:42.313Z","Laughing Bad?","<p>I wasn't a Batman fan back in 2006 when the original <em>Batman</em> line came out. It did leave an impression though. This set is essentially a remake of 7782 The Batwing: The Joker's Aerial Assault. I actually remember the first time I saw that set, which is pretty amazing as I can't think of too many other sets I recall the first time I saw them (well, with a span that long, it's toy fair season now). Joker's helicopter looked ugly then too, but the Batwing looked really nice I thought. A few years later I found out that it was supposed to resemble his logo, I was surpised. I could vaugely see the resemblence, but it was overdone. What about 6863 which costs fifteen dollars less? </p>

<p>6863 Batwing Battle Over Gotham City&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br/>Box/Instructions </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I hate doing this part. The front of the box&nbsp;looks nice. The back looks ugly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one instruction booklet. It is easy to discern between black and gray and I didn't find any mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if you wish I put more effort into this section, I don't really care about the box or instructions too much.</p>
<h4><br/>Parts </h4>
<p>At 278 pieces for $35 this is probably the worst value in a&nbsp;DC set, especially because two of the three figures can be found in nicer sets. Originally, it was rumored that this set would cost only $30 (which isn't <em>as</em> bad), but they raised it, no doubt because The Joker is included. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These aren't parts I generally use, partly because I'm not into building spaceships and such, partly because many Star Wars sets have even worse Price per Piece Ratios than this set even. So, many of the pieces are fairly new to me, even though they've been around for years. There is some purple and green, the purple parts are different than the ones included in 6862, but not enought to buy the set for. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br/>Minifigures</h4>
<p><br/>I wouldn't say that this is a set to buy for the minifigures either. They're nice, but they can be find in nicer sets than this.</p>
<p><strong>Batman</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The variation of Batman that appeared in 7781 (the original Batcave)&nbsp;was my favorite version of the Batman minifigure from the <em>Batman</em> theme, not that I ever collected that theme. The main difference between the two now is that the updated Batman has a double sided face, backprinting, and yellow where the original had gold. There are other differences, but I don't feel like listing tiny details. </p>
<p>I think I prefer this Batman, mostly because the smiling side of the face reminds me of Adam West, but I may be being optimistic because I have access to this one. I know that technically Batman shouldn't smile, but there's a nice serious face too, so&nbsp;it could be interpreted as&nbsp;more or less a bonus for Adam West fans.</p>
<p>There is one batarang included as an accessory, which is nice to have, but a little dissappointing because every set which included Batman and sold for $20 (or more)&nbsp;from the Batman line included three batarangs as well as a grapple gun, two grapple bataraings, and a couple guns for the villain(s). <br/>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Joker</strong> <br/></p>
<p>I'm not a Joker fan, but I still remember looking at that catalogue page back in 2006 and thinking how great that Joker looked. I hate clowns and almost never like a (serious) depiction of Joker, both his appearance and actions, I'm one of the few people you can find who didn't like <em>The Dark Knight</em> too much (because I didn't like the depiction of Joker). I like how Joker looks here though, and&nbsp;I guess that I'm free to make him act how I like. </p>
<p>I haven't gotten 6857 yet, but other than that, I've collected all of the system DC sets (besides promotions), and so far, I think Joker is the best figure of the line. I don't think I'm being biased because I'm not a Joker fan. The hair is nicer, and he doesn't look so cute, which isn't a big problem. Just a personal preferance related to my fear of clowns. I'm also glad that he scrapped the orange vest/undercoat, afterall, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Two-Face"">orange and purple are a horrible colorscheme</a>. I like the hair too, even though it isn't very accurate (it reminds me of Cesar Romero, a Joker depiction I enjoy, but can't take seriously), it would be nice if he could have one that looks more like how it does on the stickers in this set and the funhouse. </p>
<p>Visually, the ""BANG"" gun looks better than before, but the old one made more sense, even though it didn't look like a gun, the flag came from a pole and not the end of the gun (I don't know the term). There is also the fact that the word BANG is missing from the flag. Both have their merits. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Joker Henchman</strong> </p>
<p>Another evil clown! Yay! This is a huge improvement over the last Joker Henchman, who is also famous for working for Mr. Freeze and Two-Face. Really not much to say. He's currently the only minifigure exclusive to this set, and I hope it doesn't stay that way, just to balance out the Joker/Harley Quinn duo (I think that there should be at least&nbsp;one generic henchmen per villain, if any). </p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>The Build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed the build, it was pretty unique to me. I don't buy too much Star Wars, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/?ID=38777"">when I do I'm not very pleased</a>, but I'm sure I'm just unlucky when I do buy Star Wars. Not too much to say. I probably wouldn't of been as fond of&nbsp;building the Batwing itself if I was more accustomed to building Star Wars. </p>
<p>I have built helicopters before. I almost went into a dark age back in 2006, and if City sets hadn't started to get good, I don't know if I would be writing this. The helicopter is very different than the other small ones I've built. I haven't built many (or maybe not any) large ones, but I'm sure it's different from that just looking at the larger pieces used on those. I did make a mistake when building the helicopter, the back is different than most other LEGO ones I've constructed and caught me off guard. I think that a fair amount of imagination went into building it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Completed Model </h4>
<p>I said earlier that I felt the original Batwing was overdone, well, this one has a nicer shape I think, the only problem I have are two gray plates which mess up the view, from the top. The bottom is actrocious, being a mess of two shades of gray and black plates and just being flat. The wing pop-up feature is nice, but I don't think that two flick fire missiles are very intimidating. The four stickers (or so) work well, the yellow shows up nicely (unlike on the Batcycle and Bank sign where it was faded from 6860 and 6864 respectivly). I don't understand what the arrows are for, but they keep it from looking too plain. The batbomb on the bottom works fairly well too, but is kind of difficult to reset, I don't get the idea behind it either. Why/what would Batman bomb someone/something&nbsp;if he doesn't kill? </p>
<p>Tough to say which Batwing is better from just going by pictures, the old one was overdone, but had a nice bottom and some small details while this one needs a bottom. I managed to make the bottom actually look nice through modding, but still, it should of been there in the first place. I also wish that the gray was replaced with black. The old one also included a stand for the Batwing, which was nice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Joker helicopter on the other hand is great. It's unique from other helicopter's I've built and isn't as ugly as the old one (the old one <em>really</em> is ugly). The use of the lattice tower on the back was really creative and sets it apart from other helicopters. I don't feel the need to mod this, which is pleasant, as the Batwing took a while. The Joker gas bomb is a nice touch too, and I love how it has Joker's face. The only thing I don't get is why it shoots forward, seems like it was mixed up with Batman's bomb (which would make more sense as a missile). But this works so well that I won't complain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br/>Summary </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This DC set is one you can easily skip. Save five dollars and buy 6857 The Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape where you not only get Batman and Joker, but also Harley Quinn, The Riddler, and Robin. Unless you need the Batwing for something, skip it. It's overpriced, and even then the Batwing feels unfinished. The last Batwing was $50 for 550 pieces. Sure, Joker's helicopter was ugly and the Batwing was overdone, but it wasn't a rip-off, and I doubt that this set is as memorable as that one. </p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,2
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-09T21:51:39.413Z","Enter the Knight","<p><strong>Set #6863 Batwing Battle Over Gotham City: </strong>Back in 2006 when LEGO Batman was first released there were many great sets, unfortunately I couldn't afford many of them and so they vanished rapidly from store shelves preventing me from knowing the joy that is LEGO Batman.</p>
<p>Fast Forward to today and we find the new DC Super Heroes line re-visiting many of those exact same builds and model designs for 2012, with very few changes honestly. Perhaps the builds were different, some might call them smaller than their pre-decessors. Bur are they worth pursuing if you already own the 2006 LEGO Batman sets? Read on and find out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The LEGO DC Super Heroes sub-theme features a much more colorful box design than the older LEGO Batman Theme. For starters these ones are a lot lighter in colour compared to the darker designs of the 2006 Theme. All of them incorporate the blue color of Batman's cape, they show off the sets and their action features and include a picture of the Mini-Figures with their names in the right hand corner.</p>
<p>Overall I much prefer this design over the older Batman one, the lighter colouring means that you won't have trouble spotting them on the shelf from a distance. They also look ten times more impressive when standing next to the rich red colouring of the Marvel Super Heroes boxes, both complimenting and easily distinguishing which comic book heroes you'll find in any one set.</p>
<p>The one flaw in this box design is how the instructions are packaged, not only is there no cardboard protection, meaning you run the risk of having creased or mangled instructions. But the included comic and sticker sheet are also in danger of being damaged. (My Daily Bugle Showdown still has creased stickers that like to peel up slightly at the edges because of this practice.) It might cost more, but is it that hard to include some kind of protection for the instruction manuals and the stickers? (The comics aren't much to worry about, they're just little throwaway recyclable things honestly.)</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has a lot of nice looking parts a load of useful black and&nbsp;green&nbsp;pieces between the two models,&nbsp;the biggest part I could see being useful for MOCing though is the white line with studs used for the rope ladder, there are two in the set, one as an extra in case of loss. The purple pieces are a nice touch though and could come in handy also.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set features the black suited version of Batman, he's the exact same one from the Polybag I reviewed a while back. This time he gets batarangs plus the cape and cowl, I love the detail in his print just as much as I did before and this time the Theme of the set itself matches with the costume choice. (Being a Tim Burton-like re-enactment of the 1989 Batman climactic scene.)</p>
<p>The Joker's Henchman is a real treat to finally own, his classic looking printed jacket and the frowning clown face makeup look ideally suited for a thug working for the Joker. Like he just stepped out of the games. His main accessory is the helicopter's arsenal so he doesn't get to carry anything, but his black beanie is pretty spiffy.</p>
<p>Now we come to the Joker himself, and as I managed to pick up a loose 2006 version I can compare these two, unlike the rest of the set. While both of them have very similar patterns the subtle changes and enhancements made to the Mini-Fig since 2006 really make him stand out better in my opinon. The bowtie looks neater and cripser, the joke flower in his lapel stands out more and is larger, the checkerboard pattern on his inner coat is a vast improvement from the plain orange of the original and this new version has a double-sided torso.</p>
<p>That plus he has a double-sided head print which makes him look more menacing, his hairpiece looks a lot less Wolverine and a bit more suitable for The Joker and the fact that the new version includes white hands (to simulate the white gloved appearance he's had ocasionally in other media) makes him a keeper in my books. I will admit though the 2006 version has one thing better, his accessory was a bit better suited as it featured a classic gag flag gun with the word bang on it. This version has a genric looking red flag attached to the machine gun piece, not the best.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Using 3 numbered bags you build up the Batwing and the Joker's Copter, bag one starts you off with the front of the Batwing while bag #2 builds the rear assembly which is then combined together.</p>
<p>Bag 3 is all for the helicopter. I found this build to be pretty fast and fun, there wasn't really any part I felt would prove troubling to younger builders. The fact that these 2012 LEGO Super Heroes instructions aren't all black making it hard to see what's on each page helps immessurably. (No matter how many times I rebuild my Killer Croc set I still miss a step or two during the build because of the poor design choice.)</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Ok so this Batwing is a lot smaller compared to the 2006 version, is this a bad thing? I don't think so, being smaller the design is much easier to grasp for smaller hands. It isn't prone to potential fall apart syndrome while being played with, and the design is much more evocative of the original 1989 Batwing from Tim Burton's first film.</p>
<p>It still uses a lot of stickers for the detail work, the bat symbols and such, and it still includes flick-fire missiles as part of the play feature. I don't mind it too much because the missiles are securely hidden from view, the fact that the wings can split in order to fire them is really similar to the original design's play features, however the smaller size means that this doesn't cause problems when playing with it.</p>
<p>You can also drop a batbomb, cleverly built using Castle Axeheads attached to a lightsaber bar in grey and a few extra bits to show how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>All in all I'd say the Batwing is perfect, except of course that Batman's cape will bend and crease over time the longer you keep him in the cockpit during display.</p>
<p>The Joker's Helicopter is a big improvement over the original, I remember the commercials in 2006 showing the fun play feature of blasting the large spotlight and causing the ladder to tumble from the copter, sending the Joker to his doom. I really didn't think that play feature worked all that well, I mean what's to stop it from dislodging at the slightest touch of your finger while playing with it? (Not owning the set I can't be sure, but it seems to me that would be one of the cons of the play feature.)</p>
<p>This version is a much better looking design, it also has a few stickers for detail, huge Joker faces on the missile launcher assembly area. It also has four flick-fire missiles to shoot at Batman's vehicle, plus the huge jumbo Joker bomb full no doubt of his patented laughing gas. It has a printed piece with the eyes of the Joker on the bomb making it look even more menacing, especially once its all built up with the ominous orange stud nose.</p>
<p>Much like the Helicopter from Wolverine's Chopper Showdown I'm impressed with the design of this thing, it's fun to play with and fly around the room for the kids (or kids at heart) and it works slightly better in the look of it compared to the original. Now I do believe it is also smaller than the 2006 version, just by going off of pictures alone, but again this isn't entirely a bad thing as it makes it much more durable for younger builders' hands.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, while this set might suffer a little from sameness due to the exact same designs being used before I find this 2012 version a much better looking bargain than the older models. (And infinitely cheaper to collect compared to the old 2006 Batman sets which cost a lot these days.)</p>
<p>The entire set just looks a lot more play friendly in my opinion, the old version makes a better overall display piece, as it did include a stand you could park your Batwing on, but it just doesn't look as fun to play with and have adventures in your room of choice.</p>
<p>The much improved detail work and use of new hair pieces for the Joker Mini-Fig really sets it above the pre-decessor. My only real complaint is changing the gag gun into something a bit more generic, what was wrong with keeping that Bang flag?</p>
<p>As this set has been discontinued not only do I strongly recommend picking it up if you haven't done so already, but I also recommend it as a good investment set, in another few years time the next generation of LEGO builders are going to want to play with DC Super Heroes and who knows if another re-imagining of this one will be as fun to play with or include good play features?</p>
<p>So recommended and don't let it pass you by. Especially if you're a fan of the Tim Burton films, this set is a lot more faithful representation in my opinion, the longer wingspan of the 2006 Batwing just doesn't match my recollection of the design from the original film, plus it doesn't have the right profile when held up to a light to make the bat symbol.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"kylo_rey18","2012-08-21T16:38:12.897Z","6863-Batwing Battle Over Gotham City","<p>I just got the new batwing from the lego shop and i must say it is pretty good for a $35 set. It is a smaller version of the batwing and joker copter released in 2006, i dont have that set, so i cant compare this one to that one. Even though this one is much smaller it does have some cool features like a&nbsp;ladder joker can hang from,a shooting laughing gas bomb, and the batwing's wings can go up and down. You also get 3 minifigs, 3 great minifigs, Batman (in black suit), the joker and one of joker's henchman. Now for the pros and cons.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great minifigs,the joker is the best. 
<li>Good sized vehicles. 
<li>Cool play&nbsp;features. 
<li>Good price point.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>A few stickers. 
<li>Not&nbsp;much room for batman in the batwing, and if you put him in with his cape on it creases it. 
<li>Lots of flick fire missles ( they are lame and it is getting old seeing them in every set)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set is pretty good and is one you&nbsp;should pick up.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
