"Niallskie","2011-12-20T06:32:44.37Z","No escape for Two Face..","<p>This is the most expensive sets for the Super Heroes Theme as of now, right of the bat I'll say this is worth the wait,&nbsp;worth the&nbsp;search, and worth the&nbsp;money. I got this at our local Fred Meyer here in the SW, awesome that price was not pumped up like in TRU, and I even had a 10% off as this local store has pre-christmas sale going on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has two instructions, first one was for the Batmobile alone. Second instruction was for the Two Face Monster Truck and the Bank. I had the 2006 Batman/Two Face chase and would say that the size of the Batmobile is nearly the same. On this set though I thought the Batmobile was way better. Midway on the build I can tell that the Batmobile was very very sturdy and strong. Im very happy as well that there was little sticker on the Batmobile. The flick missile at the back was alright, perfect size for the vehicle I think. Would have been better I think if the batwing on the mobile is a bit more smaller. It seemed the wing is actually too big, althought this element had been used in previous sets. I love the booster flames, and how they just put in two flames&nbsp;while two other booster exhaust is not flamed up. Flame size is perfect for the set as to the small flames lego regularly uses. In my opinion the Batmobile rim would look better if its black or darker color other than the yellow. On set 7781 the batmobile rim&nbsp;has dull gold color which is alright, but not like the yellow on this set. I am a big comic fan and have not seen any Batmobile with yellow rim... or I maybe wrong though. Other than these I thought the Batmobile is awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Two Face Monster Truck is awesome as well. When I opened the bag and looked at the pieces I thought I dont see the Monster truck being build by just this amount of bricks, well I was dead wrong I guess. Color scheme on the truck is fantastic, though more sticker on this vehicle its reasonable as its hard to have some bricks colored half and half like the hood of the truck. Side rockets and gatling gun are fantastic armaments to do battle with Batman. Im glad Two Face actually have Two henchman, each is very different from the other. Yes torso print are the same but minifigure face extremely differ as one have goggles while the other have more facial hair. The Truck only have one seat for the driver, but Two Face can stand by the driver while the other henchman have another seat at the back to operate the crane to haul in the vault. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mini Bank is great, even have one guard to add to the playability of this set. Build of the bank is nothing special, but the gimick when the vault is jacked is very nice though simple and have been used a lot already. Actual vault was nicely built and essential to the scene that will be played out for this set. All in all this is a very very awesome set. Playability is awesome as well. Guaranteed worth your money when purchased. Another special feature of this set is the FREE brick separator. Oh and its not the old brick separater, but rather the new&nbsp;orange one as seen in this bricklink link&nbsp;:D</p>

<p>So go and get this set and complete your Super Heroes&nbsp;theme. Be it to complete the theme or not, this set alone is&nbsp;worth buying.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"LegoLee329yt","2011-12-31T00:32:11.11Z","It includes a bank--therefore this set must be gold!","Beginning<br><div>This is one awesome set. Hello I am Lee or as I am known on youtube as LegoLee329. This set is just one piece of work. Starting off with the price. 531 pieces for $49.99... and a licensed-themed set. That is under the golden mark of 10 cents per piece! Fantastic! That is the first major plus for this set.</div><div>Minifigures<br><div>&nbsp;Next up are the figures. Batman is in his black suit, same as the Batwing set, so nothing special. Two-face is very new. He has minor tweaks in the face printing and his hair has not changed. Beyond that he is completely different. He uses the comic style of having half purple and half orange. Going along with Two-face are his henchmen, both having the same new torso prints. One has a new face, while the others face can be found on Scrum in the Pirates of the Caribbean sets. Last and actually least is the police man/security guard. I say security guard because he is working in the bank. His print is from city. Nothing is new about this guy. The coolest part about him is that he gives nods to old LEGO Batman fans with his face. That face was Bruce Wayne's first LEGO face.&nbsp;</div></div><div>Build</div><div>&nbsp;Build goes together awesome. It flows, not too hard or easy--just a great build. The Batmobile is the most fun to build, but it is interesting to see how Two-face's truck comes together. This set has 4 numbered bags, 2 for the Batmobile, 1 for Two-faces truck, and the other for the bank. It took me around 30 minutes to build. I have been building for years, if you are new it could take much longer.&nbsp;</div><div>Play Value</div><div>&nbsp;Very good here. LEGO cars are just fun to roll around. The Batmobile has an opening cockpit and 2 flick missiles in the back. Two-face's tuck has 2 flick missile, and rotating gun, and a adjustable crane. Even the bank has features with an opening door, opening safe, and best of all the wall blows up. Very good play value in this set.&nbsp;</div><div>Overall.</div><div>&nbsp;This is a 9/10 worthy set. My biggest complaint in the fact none of the items you get are that big, just 3 medium sized bits. Beyond that awesome, I love this set and would highly say you get it!</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"captain_radda_radda","2012-01-08T04:26:58.627Z","The Perfect Set","First off late me say that I am an enormous Batman fan. As a hardcore fan, I felt that the previous incarnation of the Batmobile was poor and rather unfaithful to the source material. The missle in the front was pointless and made the vehicle look obscene (if you know what I mean). The front was poor, but the back half was very well designed and was rather innovative. The same can be said for this batmobile. This set is superb in every way possible. It is perfectly sized and fits nicely in the new batcave. Also, the front looks awesome and the set maintains a streamline design without looking stretched out or elongated like the last one. The boosters look great and the idea to color the interior red was a nice idea. It is a unique design altogether and can best be compared to the earlier Tim Burton films. Now on to two-faces vehicle. It is fantastic, if not ridiculous. Its got a crane, a gatling gun, and missles! That's just awesome. The truck is perfectly symetrical and does justice to both the Tim Burton films and the animated series. It is far superior to the original armored car, which was cramped and overly blocky. Overall, this set's greatest achievement is the inclusion of a bank. This bank looks like something from Gotham and gives the set a conflict and an enormous playability factor. It does what most ""chase"" sets fail to do: give them a start and general meaning. Where did the money come from? Didn't the cops try to stop him? This set answers these questions and, for that earns a perfect score. The minifigs are phenomenal by the way. Batman is awesome and is truly an amazing fig. The thugs are cool and match with two face well. They look like idiots and the perfect stereotype for henchmen. Two-face himself is awesome. His body is symetrical and, of course, you gotta love that hair. I'm not crazy about his suit, but oh well. I loved the original two-face fig, but this version is much more detailed and fits better in the more lighthearted batman sets. The cop is cool and fits well. Overall, this set is a real winner and truly a must-buy. Yes it is expensive and for the price you dont get anything big. You do, however, get a superb, well designed piece of art that will please any Batman fan. &nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"Berrus_Brickus","2012-02-27T18:15:20.57Z","Working Title","<p>This is my second Super Heroes review, the first being 6858. This is currently the second biggest set of the DC Universe line and features Batman with his most famous vehicle, the Batmobile, Two-Face and his new truck, and a bank. Like most of the DC sets, this is essentially a remake of an older Batman set; 7781 The Batmobile: Two-Face's Escape. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[img]http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120210194315/lego/images/6/61/6864_poster.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>This set, 6864</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[img]http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100603002833/lego/images/4/42/7781-0000-xx-23-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>7781 The Batmobile: Two-Face's Escape</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the bank and price point, there is one major difference you may or may not of noticed about Two-Face and the minifigures/vehicles at his disposal: The color scheme. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions </h4>
<p>There is a cartoony image of Batman up in the upper right-hand corner (wearing the Blue Super Heroes suit, not the included Black one). The DC and LEGO logos are on the other side and SUPER HEROES appears under the DC logo in large golden letters. There is a batsymbol in the lower right hand corner and a shot of the five minifigures included and a notice of the comic book in the lower lefthand. The back of the box shows features of the set against a yellow background. Unlike with the Catwoman set, I like the yellow here, I probably didn't like it there because it clashed horribly with the purple bike, where here there are many more colors than purple. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two instruction booklets, each with the same image as the box, but without the comic book notice and such. There is not trouble to discern between black and dark gray as black pieces now have white outlines. The instructions are easy to follow, and are printed against a nice, light blue background. On every other righthand page, there are blue images of Batman, Superman, and The Joker. It's looks nice, but bugs me because Batman has the torso he had in preliminary pictures of 6858 Catwoman Catcycle City Chase and Superman has a nonexistant expression and the wrong hairpiece. Joker seems fine though. The first manual is for the Batman and the Batmobile, while the second is for Two-Face, his henchmen, and the Guard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The comic book is the same size as the two instruction manuals and seems to currently be the last of the LEGO/DC series haveing a red 5 in the lower left hand corner. The cover is a picture of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman standing on the rooftop with mugshots of The Joker, Catwoman, Lex Luthor, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, and Bane. The first two pages of the comic are dedicated to a story about Catwoman and Batman, which seems to be available with every other comic book and was even featured in the back of 6858's instruction manual. Then there is a page advertising all fo the current DC figures and the sets they come in. Then we get to the story about Two-Face. Simply, Two-Face and his henchmen rob the bank by using the crane arm to abduct to safe. The Guard clings to the safe, and Two-Face consults his coin and pushes the guard off (that's the last we see of him). Batman then races out of the Batcave in the Batmobile and easily defeats Two-Face. Then there is an image of The Joker planning to dispose of Batman with Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Bane hunched over him. And lastly, there is a page giving sneak peeks at some of the other comics with a small panel from each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes 531 parts for $50, which is above the ""golden ratio"" of 10 cents a piece, something which licnesed sets hardly ever meet. However, this set's predecessor had 386 pieces for $30. So, it's not as good as the predecessor, but that it is still pretty great! </p>
<p>The parts are divided up into four bags-The first with Batman, half of the batmobile, and a new brick separator. Yes, a brick separator is included! The second bag has the rest of the batmobile. The third has Two-Face, his hencmen, and their truck. And lastly, the fourth features the Guard, the safe, and the bank. </p>
<p>There is a sticker sheet included, I normally always apply mine, so I can't tell you if they detract from the set too much or not, but I'd recomend at least placing the one for the orange/purple truck's hood. </p>
<p>I wouldn't recomend getting a set like this for parts, but that's just because I don't like getting large sets for parts myself, but it does include a fair ammount of tan and black bricks and some orange and purple. </p>
<p>One stand out piece would be Two-Face's new coin, which is one of those printed 1x1 round plates. It is printed with the ""good"" side, and I hear tell that it might be representing a silver dollar with Susan B. Anthony. The printing is more distinct and the coin darker than the cropped <a href=""mailto:Shop@Home"">Shop@Home</a> photo below. Also, Two-Face's left hand is not that color. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures </h4>
<p>There are five minifigures included-Batman, Two-Face, two Two-Face henchmen, and the Guard. The minifigures are all superb. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Batman </strong></p>
<p><br/>The variation of Batman that appeared in 7781 (the original Batcave) was my favorite version of the Batman minifigure from the <em>Batman</em> theme, not that I ever collected that theme. The main difference between the two now is that the updated Batman has a double sided face, backprinting, and yellow where the original had gold. There are other differences, but I don't feel like listing tiny details. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I prefer this Batman, mostly because the smiling side of the face reminds me of Adam West, but I may be being optimistic because I have access to this one. I know that technically Batman shouldn't smile, but there's a nice serious face too, so it could be interpreted as more or less a bonus for Adam West fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one batarang included as an accessory, which is nice to have, but a little dissappointing because every set which included Batman and sold for $20 (or more) from the Batman line included three batarangs as well as a grapple gun, two grapple bataraings, and a couple guns for the villain(s). <br/></p>
<p><br/><strong>Two-Face </strong></p>
<p><br/>I do like this Two-Face minifigure, but there are things about the old one which I prefer. First of all, and probably most obvious, the colorscheme. Orange and purple are not color wheel opposites, so to me, they don't say split personality, whereas black and white does so perfectly. I won't take points off for it though because it's colorful, and that suits LEGO. Another thing I'm not so fond of is the eye on the scarred side. Where the old one was large and bulging, the way I'm used to, this one doesn't even have a pupil and makes it look blind to me.</p>
<p>Another good thing about the colorscheme is it adds variation if you already own the black/white Two-Face and may be what makes this set worth it, being very different from 7881. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nit-picks aside, Two-Face is otherwise fantastic and his suit and face have much more detail than before. But still, I hope that we see him in a black/white suit sometime later. And believe it or not, some of the BrickLink prices for the black/white suit&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lower price&nbsp;than the orange/purple one.</p>
<p><br/>There are no weapons included for Two-Face, he only has his coin. One problem I have with the Super Heroes theme is that none of the villains carry guns for some odd reason (except for Joker's <em>fake</em> one). They can have them on their vehicles, but forbid they carry them. </p>
<p><br/>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Henchmen</strong> </p>
<p><br/>There are two hencmen included and unlike the original Batman hencmen, these two have much more personality than the triplets (look up the original henchmen from the Batman theme to explain triplet). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of them have the&nbsp;same purple/orange jacket, gray pants, and knit cap, but the faces are unique not only between to two, but to the set. The first one has brown stubble and a scar running down the side of his face (and no, it isn't Scrum's as another reviewer said). The second has a black beard and purple sunglasses. I love his sunglasses, they add a lot of personality just because they aren't black I think. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the hencmen has a crowbar and the other a stick of dynamite (I guess that LEGO considers those less violent than guns). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that this would also be the section to say that this set includes two hencmen as opposed to 7781's singl one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><strong>The Guard </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Bit of trivia about the guard, he is the only minifigure in the entire DC Universe line to reuse a head, Bruce Wayne's original one in fact. He is also wrongly accused of sharing a torso with the City&nbsp;Detective. That is false, the guards's torso is similar to the detective's, but has a few more lines on the front and no backprinting. Oh yeah, that reminds me, he is also the only figure in the DC subtheme not to have any backprinting. The guard is armed with a pair of handcuffs and a walkie-talkie. Unlike the other minifigures in the set, he does not have a Batman counterpart, unless you count video game only minifigures (which I don't). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Build </h4>
<p>You build the Batmobile first, and I found it interesting. I found it interesting mostly because there wasn't as much black, gray, and yellow as I expected. Most of the black and gray covers red, blue, and white, which I guess makes it easier to keep track of bricks, and at the end, it is mostly hidden. You can still make out a couple of out of place red bricks in the cockpit (and no, not the seat) and the wheels don't cover up long red hole-bricks compltetely. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two-Face's truck was more predictable and easier to build. There weren't any advanced or unpredicted techniques used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bank was nice to build in a vehicle/vehicle conflict set mostly because it's uncommon that it happens. Again though, nothing special. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a set to get for the build, but it isn't a bad one-not overly easy, but not challenging. </p>
<h4>The Completed Model </h4>
<p>Nothing really unexpected, but the Batmobile is rather long (see the gallery below), but I guess it has to be. Two-Face's truck fits into City scale well, as does the bank. There are no stand out playfeatures-both vehicles have two flick-fire missiles, Two-Face's truck (which only has room for two minifigures, see gallery below) also has a crane, and the bank has a blasting window (which I find dificult to reset, a removable roof would of been nice). </p>
<p>I prefer this Batmobile to the old one, because </p>
<ul>
<li>A) this one doesn't have a cannon in the front 
<li>
<li>B) It's not as long as the one from 7781. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people have complained about the yellow wheels, personally, I don't mind them, and my biggest problem is how badly the seat peaks being 4 studs wide, rather than two, which isn't too big of a problem. Oh, and placing Batman in with his cape on may damage the cape. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Two-Face's truck more than the last one too, except for the colors, but I can tolerate those. My biggest problem with the truck is there is only room for two minifigures, so somebody is going to have to ride on the safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bank is a nice touch, but not a reason to get the set for, unless you can't afford this and 3661 Bank &amp; Money Transfer, the current City bank. Unlike the other two buildings in the DC line, the bank isn't really campy, though I think it's cheesy that the safe is on display, it may just be due to size restrictions. </p>
<h4><br/>Summary </h4>
<p>Like 6858 Catwoman Catcycle City Chase, this is probably the kind of set that you'd get for the figures, but even if you do, there is a great Batmobile, a nice bank, and an ugly truck (but not a <em>bad</em> one). I would recomend this set, it has great minifigures, is well designed, and has an above perfect (no that doesn't make sense) price per piece ratio. <br/></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"Crazybrick45","2012-07-14T18:21:30.727Z","The second incarnation of Batman vs. Two-Face does not disappoint","<p>This is the first LEGO set that I've purchased in a while, and my first set of the Batman theme[from the earlier series or from the new Super Heroes line] as a whole. I can say, for certain, that I wasn't disappointed. At first I was a little bit hesitant, seeing as this version was $20 more expensive than its predecessor, 7781-1 The Batmobile: Two Face's Escape, because I essentially saw the same thing - two vehicles, one for Batman and one for the villain, and a side feature[in this case the bank as opposed to the lamp-post in 7781-1. But I can say for certain that I was not disappointed at all, and this tops 7781-1 by far.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box art was what attracted me to this set in the first place. It showcases Two Face's orange and purple truck blasting past the bank, the safe getting caught up by the truck's crane as the window of the bank blasts out, sending dollar bills flying everywhere. The security guard frantically chases after the one henchman, who is seemingly left behind by his compatriot and his boss, Two-Face. The Batman is right there to thwart Two-Face's plans, though, and fires a flick-fire missile from the back of the Batmobile as he veers towards the villain's truck at an intersection. The back of the box showcases all the features of the set, including the flick fire missiles, Two Face's truck's crane, and the exploding wall of the safe.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Inside the box are four bags, two instruction booklets, and a page of stickers. One of the booklets is dedicated to the Batmobile, and the other for Two Face's truck and the bank. Two of the bags are for Batman and the Batmobile, the third for Two Face and his henchmen as well as his truck, and the other for the security guard and the bank. The instruction booklets very clearly explain each of the steps, as should be expected from any LEGO instruction booklet.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>I was rather disappointed to find none of the submachine-guns that frequently accompanied the previous Batman line's villains and henchmen, but there are still some nice accessories, such as one of the new crowbars and two coins for Two-Face to flip around and decide his fate. Both are identical, and printed on them appears to be a girl with her hair put up in a high ponytail. Two-Face is able to hold it in his hand, unfortunately, it can't be placed on top.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Batmobile</b>&nbsp;doesn't have any especially unique parts, but it does have a great cockpit canopy, useful flame pieces from the exhaust, and the 'fins' on the back of the Batmobile are definitely useful for MOCing. There are also a lot of curvy block pieces used to make up the front and back detailing of the Batmobile.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Two Face's truck</b>&nbsp;has a pretty good array of parts in orange and purple to match his suit and henchmen, as well as four binoculars that make up the gatling gun on the left side of the truck.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The bank</b>&nbsp;has loads of beige-ish pieces, including 1x1 cylinders and some 2x1 curvy blocks. There's also a nice door piece and two window panes with frames.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>I thought that <b>The Batmobile</b>&nbsp;had an unusually blocky skeleton, compared to some of the recent LEGO cars that have come out recently. It was a build that wouldn't give any real difficulty to a basic builder, and could be knocked out in, I suppose, half an hour at the least. The only real part I personally had trouble with was the flick-fire missile holder in the back, which required pushing a single red Technic pin all the way through a piece. It definitely hurts your thumbs if you're trying to do it that way, but I found that pushing it through with a pen was able to do the job.</div><div><br></div><div>There was nothing special or difficult about the build of&nbsp;<b>Two Face's truck</b>&nbsp;either. The same deal, as described earlier, with the Batmobile.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The bank's </b>build consisted mainly of stacking several layers of 1x1 cylinders and 2x1 cylindrical blocks to make the walls. A simple and nondescript build.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div><br></div><div>There's nothing incredibly new about the<b>&nbsp;</b>version of <b>Batman</b>&nbsp;in this set. He's got his regular black pants, arms, hands, and muscle-printed back and front. Compared to the older versions, the belt is slightly more detailed around the buckle, adding a couple extra lines. His head looks like a good representation of an aging crimefighter like himself, one side featuring a neutral, rather grim expression and some lines for his cheeks. The other side features a more cocky look. As you probably know, there's a white band on the front of each side of his head, so that when you put his mask on there will be white eyeholes. It's not something that you can cover up with a hairpiece, but I suppose it could pass as a bandage. A guy like Batman is bound to get plenty of injuries with his job.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Two-Face</b>&nbsp;has an all new body, pants, and face, but his hair is the same mold from the Two-Face of the 2006 line. The head is much more detailed, one side showing the good-natured Harvey Kent and the other the disfigured, evil side of Two-Face, with an empty eye socket and a snarling smile. Great figure, although his old hairpiece doesn't exactly fit with the color scheme of his new suit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The henchmen </b>have new bodies - and faces as far as I know - too. Each has on a grey sweatshirt underneath a orange-and-purple zippered jacket. Each has a unique face. One has a sly smile, goatee, and a pair of purple-rimmed sunglasses. The other has a pair of angry eyebrows and a growl for a smile, with a scar just next to his left eye.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Henchmen and Two Face have slightly different creases in their shirts for back prints.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>All of the sections of the set look pretty cool once finished. The Batmobile was a pretty sleek and slender feel for a LEGO vehicle - I think if it were just a bit longer in the midsection it would have been a perfect representation.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Two Face's truck, of course, is the part of the set that has the most personality. Decked out in the classic purple-and orange decor of Two Face from Bob Kane's early Batman comics, it was a definitely a major selling part of the set for me. There's a nice armament on each side of the truck - on the right, a harness with a pair of flick-fire missiles, and on the left side, a gatling gun, though it doesn't serve any functioning play purpose, you can easily imagine a torrent of bullets streaming out of it, intent on stopping the Batman right in his tracks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love the bank. It looks something that would come right out of any modern big city, and would fit in perfect with any City diorama. There's just enough room inside so that you could have a couple of civillians standing around with the security guard behind the desk, but not much else. Above the door is a stickered sign that says ""BANK."" Both of the window panes have a sticker on them with a dollar sign. In the left wall on the outside of the bank is a little mechanism so that you can blow out the windows of the bank. From the inside, the mechanism isn't incredibly noticeable.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>An excellent set for those just getting into the Superheroes line. Cool vehicles, uncomplicated build, and a good amount of play features, as well as some great minifigures. I recommend it.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Tre1awny","2021-01-03T23:35:54.273Z","It still holds up","<p>8 years later this set still holds up, it&#39;s a good display piece and a great display piece to adorn any DC setup.</p>

<p>The pros: The 5 figures in the set batman, two-face, two of his goons and a generic police officer. Two face and his goons are all superb and exclusive to this set the other two being the all black (with yellow belt) batman and the generic policemen being pretty common in 2012 and not at all sought after. At the current time of writing, two-face on the other hand seems to fetch a price of around $20-$30, the orange and purple version seeming to still be the favourite after all these years. Right onto the builds first up the bank, this seems to just a very small almost 2d bank but that&#39;s OK since it serves its purpose perfectly which is to hold the money cache and inevitably get stolen taking a one-way ride through the front window. The vehicles of the set primarily being the focus are excellent the bat mobile is sleek and stealth like, and two-faces truck is loud and boisterous boasting a clash of purple and orange.</p>

<p>Cons: Where?</p>

<p>All in all this a great set for any DC fan.</p>
