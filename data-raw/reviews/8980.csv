"captain_radda_radda","2012-01-13T01:09:42.457Z","Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah BATMAN!","WOW! This set is completely fantastic. I recently bought it with some left over christmas money. Boy, I was surprised. Let me start by saying that $70 is a fair price for this set. It is relatively large, includes two vehicles, and has a darn good selection of minifigs. Yes, the set is lacking in features, but the attention to detail is amazing. Personally, I like this set MUCH better than the original batcave. The original looked like a dungeon or even a castle that gave the impression that it was really not in a cave. This set looks like a batcave. It is rich with technology that infuses into stone pieces which gives the cave-like impression. It includes a door that can fit the Batmobile through. Also, the batcomputer is not overdone as it was in the original. The original had trophies and a katana etc. THIS ISN'T WAYNE MANOR LEGO! This new set truly feels like a batcave should: isolated somewhat small with hints of technology. Now on to the figs. Batman is awesome. I love his cape and color scheme. Also, Robin is pretty cool. He is wearing all red and is remnicent of the Robin from ""Batman &amp; Robin."" He has a comb-over that is a black Obi-wan hairpiece from Clone Wars. Bruce Wayne is cool, but I don't like his widows peak hair or elderly appearence as opposed to the young bachelor version from the original. Ivy is by far the best fig. Her hair has leaves in it and the print on her body is complex and detailed as opposed to the original which was just leaves and light green legs. Bane is also awesome with his Venom tube that leads to his head. His eyes are a little strange compared to the original, but the fact that Bane is minifig is fine enough. The Batcycle is decent, but its a little lackluster. The drill is were its at. This thing is cool and the drill spins while the vehicle moves. Overall, this set is fantastic. It is well-detailed and decently sized with enough playability to last any kid quite a while. If you get the chance to pick up this set, I highly recommend it.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Berrus_Brickus","2012-03-03T22:54:18.677Z","Holy Mega Bloks, Batman! ~ Robin","<p>This is the largest set of the DC Universe subtheme as of now, and I'd probably say that it's the flagship of the wave. I almost always say the big sets are though. Again, a remake, this time of 7783 The Batcave: The Penguin and Mr. Freeze's Invasion.</p>
<p>This set has recieved its fair share of hate, but not usually from owners from what I've seen. I will do my best to decode why in this review.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set includes 690 parts for $70, which I think is very good. It is very close to the golden ratio, and I think that the exclusive figures and pieces make up for it, I don't think dark blue is a cheap color to make and the figures are very detailed, especially Poison Ivy. A lot of rare pieces are included, mostly in transparent light blue and eartharth blue. There is also a lot of black, dark stone gray, and light stone gray, but not on too many rare parts. There is some juniorization, but mostly on transparent parts, which I support completly because transparent pieces in the same color look bad with one another, which is one of the two reasons I am sure we will never see Wonder Woman's invisible jet. There are a few other juniorize parts, but they either are meant to have stickers on them (which is good, because nobody likes them to overlap) or are for structure, but there are a few 1x2x2 bricks which aren't really needed. There are a lot of parts in rare colors, as I said, mostly the trans. light blue and dark blue. I am pretty sure that those dark blue lattice towers are exclusive. I know that that black printed radar dish with the batsymbol is. The minifigure parts are great too, but I'll go into that in the minifigure section. There are some stickers, but most of them were big and I found them easy to apply, except for the one on the elevator of Batman, once you get that one down, there is no getting it off. The extras weren't anything too special, but there was an extra gear included for Bane's drill. Like {6864 Batmobile and the Two-Face Chase, there was a brick separator included, one of the new orange ones.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigures are all very detailed (except for Bruce who is pretty average) but all have minor misprints. I find that this is the price you pay for detailed figs and if you don't look too closely and specifically for misprints, you probably won't find them.</p>
<p><strong>Batman<br/></strong>I need to correct something from [[Review:6858 Catwoman Catcycle City Chase|my review of 6858]]. I never said that my Batman from that set had a misprint on the torso. Look in the image below to see if you can find it in the abdomen area on the jet-packed one's torso. It may look like the lighting, but it is not. The torso on the one included though doesn't have the misprint (literally, it looks like the printer missed the figure there), but the figure's printing does have its faults; with the cowl removed, you can make out the beginnings of Bruce's eyebrows under the head band. The left eyebrow is missing on one side. Thanfully, my other Batmen faces are fine and the cowl covers it up. Other than that, this figure is spectacular and the blue cape is really nice. As that's the only thing different from 6858, I'll just copy what I had there; This variation of Batman seems to be a cross between three previous ones from the original Batman line. Batman has an Earth Blue cowl, which was previously exclusive to the two Batman sets from 2007. The face is okay, but looks too much like Superman's, only younger and with a white headband. The head is double sided, with a scowl on one side and a large smirk on the other. If it wasn't for the smirk (which reminds me of the campy Adam West Batman), I would actually prefer the original face to this one. I like the torso more than the original, mostly because it has my favorite Batsymobol with the rounded appearance and yellow background and backprinting.<br/><strong>Robin<br/></strong>Tim Drake has recieved a new costume since 2008 and now sports a red/black/yellow colored one rather than a red/green/yellow one. I personally never cared for the green on the old one, it clashed with the red too much I thought. I liked the yellow cape more though I think, but black looks nice too. Robin now has Obi-Wan Kenobi's Clone Wars hairpiece in black. It looks okay, definitly a good idea and reminds me of the campy sixties Robin's hair (even though that was Dick Grayson and has probably been used elsewhere). The black isn't as affective though as the original color, so I'm saying it looks better in burnt orange. The torso print is great, and I do prefer it to the original, but it isn't all that different, save for the backprinting inclusion. The face is great, I don't like the scowling experssion all that much, but the screaming/""Holy &lt;insert relative word here&gt;, Batman!"" side is hilarious. I do have a problem with the torso, but I'm not complaining, here. You'll have to wait until my Funhouse arrives, because it goes along with The Riddler's new variation.<br/><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong></p>
<p>Not much to say, really nothing special. The hairpiece is a nice inclusion, and it is exclusive in this color to this set. The face is too similar to Superman's for my taste, the only difference being that this one doesn't have any wrinkles and isn't double-sided. The sand blue suit is exclusive, but I think that he might look better in Remus Lupin's new one. I would actually prefer and use the old figure's face because of the resemblence to Superman, but then it would be inconsitant with Batman because of the lack of cheekbones. I guess I'll live with it.</p>
<p><strong>Bane</strong></p>
<p>I prefer most of the minifigures from this line to their Batman counterparts, except for probably Two-Face, but Bane I have mixed feelings about. I've never cared much for the character, he's just a smart luchador on super steroids, but maybe that's because I haven't found a depiction I particularly like. I prefer the new face to the old one, but it's less accurate to the depictions I've seen (not know, seen) where the old one is more accurate. I also like the dark blue luchador outfit of the old one, the analogous black isn't very good looking. One more thing I prefer about the old one; it doesn't have a huge belt taking up the waste. I can tolerate it on Batman and Robin because they have a need for big belts, even though I'd prefer smaller ones, but I feel as though on Bane it is covering up way too much of his torso. I do prefer the back though, the backpack and tube going up his head are nice. Bane isn't a bad figure in terms of detail though, and I'm still glad to have him. I feel he has great potential for a character, I only need to find away which I feel expresses that well. I like this figure, I just feel that the old one is better, except for the back</p>
<p><strong>Poison Ivy</strong></p>
<p>I did save this one for last on purpose. She is great, the printed hair, the face with it's expressions, the leg printing, and torso too. The best part, none of it is chinese. I will reserve my thoughts on hybrid minifigures for when 6862 is reviewed though. This is a huge improvement over the original, but I still think that there is room for improvement. That hairpiece in red is really bright at first, but it is tolerable. Like Bane, I have yet to find a depiction of Ivy that I like, but from what I understand, this minifigure works the way the character is supposed to-the happy side paired with the plant-motif leotard and stockings and red hair is attractive, while the angry side makes it kind of creepy (and reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbean mermaids). I almost prefer the original torso, if it wasn't for that one stray leaf on her side which really bugs me, I would.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Other thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The minifigures are great and all, but I can't help but feel that only five is enough to justify such a large price tag. I would of liked at least one more, preferably [[Alfred]], but I would of settled for [[Tim Drake]]. I would've traded Bruce for Alfred easily, as Bruce would be much easier to make than Alfred.</p>
<h4><br/>The Build</h4>
<p>There are five bags included:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is for Batman, Bane, the batcycle, and the drill tank<br/>The second one is for Poison Ivy and her holding cell<br/>The third for the start of the elevator and Bruce Wayne<br/>The fourth to finish the elevator tower 
<li>The fifth for Robin, the entryway, and the batcomputer</li></ul>
<p>I have no idea why they split the figs up, my guess would be to try and foil resellers from selling all the bags but number one opened (for those that try to sell the figs and set seperatly). I enjoyed the build, and it went smoothly. I like to build the drill tank as I almost never get sets with gears and I always enjoy using them. The elevator was a little difficult at times because attaching those Technic rods is difficult, but not too bad, except for it made the supports collapse at times. While about halfway through the enrtryway build, the step where you add the large plates for the second floor, I pushed down on a piece besides the plates you needed to add to hard and a piece came off and gave me a fair scratch on my left thumb, so be careful. Other than my minor injury and applying the Technic beams, I enjoyed the build. The small and large parts made it interesting, as did the colorscheme-it's a great colorscheme.</p>
<h4><br/>The Completed Model</h4>
<p>I just said that I loved the colorscheme, and I do. I think it works with both Batman variations we have. The trans. blue, grays, black, yellow, and dark blue all look pretty good together. When the first clear pictures surfaced, this set was criticized for being too bright. The only spot I'd call bright is the BAT GEAR wall, and only because of the yellow. I like the design of the set too, it seems to be a cross between the last LEGO Batcave and the campy sixties (I'm starting to sound like a broken record, aren't I?) Batcave, but a more modern version of it. And by modern, I mean high-tech, because that one was for the time (sadly, I can't find a picture of it). I remember that people were excited that this seemed to be an add-on to the original Batcave, I beg to differ. First of all, the colorscheme and style are different. This one is like a high-tech version of the sixties Batcave with a more colorful colorscheme which fits how the Super Heroes theme is more campy and colorful. The original Batcave though used black and dark gray for the colorscheme and a more gothic look, which worked for the ''Batman'' theme. Plus, this one has mostly everything that the other one did (or needed rather), except for a turning platform for the Batmobile, except it has all been restyleized. So, I think that this set is different enough than the original, and I like it more than what I've seen of the old Batcave, but more on that in the summary. Before I forget about the vehicles, this is my favorite of the three batcycles LEGO has done so far, but I'd like to add a few aspects from the funhouse one to this, but I prefer this one. The tank is hilarious and works well, the colors are weird though, it looks like it belongs to Robin more than Bane.</p>
<p>I do have a problem with the stickers though, even though I usually don't. Some of them make the set too specialized for the situation. Ivy's cell can only be for her with the stickers because of the floral designs and the scan with her picture, so you can't put Bane or anyone else in there with the stickers, so I simply didn't apply those. I also cut up the one for the batcomputer with Bane's picture because it read INTRUDER ALERT and had a small picture of a drill so that it wouldn't be so specialized, but wouldn't leave a monitor blank. Same thing with the ALERT! turrets, but those are just extra pieces as far as I care. The completed appearance is nice though, but I doubt it would be as nice without the stickers I ''did'' apply.</p>
<h4><br/>Summary</h4>
<p>Great figures, great design, pretty good colorscheme, and great playability. Great price too, and a good size for it. People have complained about it being smaller than the last Batcave. I don't know how many people noticed, but this one also costs fifty dollars less and has 400 less pieces. And really, the only thing worth missing is the vehicle turntable, the old Batcave had a huge cell and the batsignal inside of the Batcave (how does that make any sense?) as well as large, empty spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros<br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Great colorscheme<br/>Minifigures included are great<br/>Vehicles are nice, but nothing too special<br/>Play features are nice-spinning drill and changing elevator (the elevator needs to loosen up though)<br/>Nice pieces in rare colors</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p><strong>
<ul>
<li><br/></strong>Some of the stickers make it seem specialized (they don't need to be applied though, and can be modified)<br/>Could use another figure</li></ul>
<p>I'd recomend this, mostly for the figures, but I like the set too. It is pricey, but doesn't cost as much as the old Batcave. If you have the old Batcave and are happy with it, I'd say that you could skip this and BrickLink Ivy and Bane (unless you own the old one).</p>

"Kez","2012-02-20T11:19:49.09Z","Awesome-must buy","This set is a must buy. It has really cool mini-figures such as batman who is also included in a few other sets, robin who has a really neat design and a new hair style who comes in 1 other set, bane who has cool printing of the venom pipes on his back of his body as well as the front, poison ivy who has a really detailed torso and a nice printed head piece, and Bruce Wayne who is the only exclusive one for this set. Now the coolest part of this set has got to be the elevator which when you pull the pin (technic piece) out of the back of the elevator, it transforms Bruce Wayne into batman, and also in this section it has a really cool bridge leading from the elevator to the computer, and the gadgets for batman are pretty cool. I also like the red phone that is on top of the elevator for commissioner Gordon who can contact Bruce to give him a tip off. Now onto poison Ivy's prison cell, I think that this little section has cool detailed stickers such as the ones of ivy being scanned and the alert one which is on top off the prison cell which fires 2 flick fire missiles. I also think that the door that leads to the prison cell which has some light sabres on is a good idea because bane can hold onto them and pull the door of to rescue poison ivy. Now onto the bat computer section, it has a nice computer screen which only requires 3 stickers and on the decals it has a picture of Bane, a map and one of his drill mobile. Also in this area it has 2 flick fire missiles mounted onto a swivel round brick reading alert, and the coolest part in this section has got to be the sliding doors which can prevent bane from entering the bat cave, these doors are located underneath the bat computer. Now onto the cars, these cars are really cool and only require a few stickers, the coolest car of the 2 has got to be banes drilling mobile which when you push the car along, the caterpillar tracks help turn the drill so it actually looks like its drilling. And last but not least the bat cycle, this one is really cool and only requires a few stickers. Overall I think this set is a must buy for those batman fans out there and I found it very easy to build. The bonuses in this set are that it included a new orange brick remover and an extra sticker sheet with the same stickers included(for me any way) happy building :)<div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
