"CapnRex101","2012-04-07T18:34:23.783Z","6865 - Captain America's Avenging Cycle","<p>The long anticipated Marvel sets have&nbsp;finally&nbsp;arrived and I for one am certainly not disappointed by them at all. This set in particular is a triumph for me due to the outstanding Minifigures, the lovely vehicles, and the superb playability. Anyway, let's get on with the main review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very nice, the same size as any other box at this battle pack price point. It is predominantly dark red along the top which is very striking, but the best thing is the fantastic shot of the four most legendary Lego Avengers in the top right hand corner. The gold Super Heroes logo looks great too as does the logo for the film in the bottom corner. The main image shows Captain America in action on his motorbike, throwing his trademark shield at the two marauding aliens who stand on their vehicles shooting at our hero. The two flick fire missiles in the set are flying past him and there are plenty of laser blasts and explosions all over the picture. The background is a suspension bridge which seems to be on fire, lucky for Captain America however it appears a couple of helicopters are approaching in the background. The back of the box demonstrates the flick fire missiles and another action shot of the set. In the bottom right corner there is another picture of the Avengers but this time they are not in Lego form.</p><p>The instructions share the same design as the box and I found no mistakes. The comic included with the set is found in the back of the instructions, I like these comics as they certainly inspire possible ways to play with each of the sets for younger&nbsp;builders. There were no missing pieces either for me.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a whole heap of wonderful parts in this little set. An incredible eight gold pieces (not including the heads of the mysterious aliens) which I love, and a fair amount of dark tan as well! There are three four by four slopes in dark tan which come in very handy for MOCs and four lovely scythe pieces in gold.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have been seen in Ninjago sets before as detailing on vehicles and occasionally as a weapon. The numerous slope pieces are welcome and there is of course that nice dark red motorbike, a unique and attractive colour which could be nice to have in your Lego City if you prefer Captain America to be fighting his enemies at a closer range.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The three Minifigures are all really excellent. <b>Captain America</b> is of course the&nbsp;indisputable&nbsp;highlight of the three,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not by as much as you might expect. He is supremely detailed all over, with a nice head piece featuring the open areas of the mask and the legendary 'A' on his forehead which is very accurate to the recent Captain America movie as well as his appearance in trailers for the upcoming Avengers film. There is even a bit of printing on the back of his head of some kind of flap. His torso is also highly detailed with muscles and plenty of patriotic colours all over. The white star is there on his chest as are the red and white stripes which cross his torso. He wears a belt and a couple of little metal clips on his&nbsp;shoulders. The back printing is really awesome as well with a continuation of the red and white printing on the front and more metal bits. His arms are plain dark blue with dark red hands to match his shield. The legs are just more plan dark blue which is the most&nbsp;prominent&nbsp;and striking colour on figure, I am pleased to see this rather than regular blue as it is more accurate. His shield is a unique moulded piece and looks great, much like the prop in the film. It is nice and shiny with just the right colours and the white star. I know that was a long and detailed description but this figure is truly worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>The two mystery villains are almost as good. It is good to see some variation as one of them is a standard <b>Soldier</b> and the other is a <b>General</b>. Therefore they wear different uniforms, both of which are delightful. The heads are quite similar with various patterns on their masks and two menacing purple eyes looking out. The printing is on gold heads and is continued on the back of both figures. The torsos also share similar patterns with large chest plates and a lot more gold panels. The general's torso is dark grey with light grey arms and dark grey legs, the soldier's torso and legs are entirely light grey before being printed on. They share purple gloves as well as some nice leg printing. One of them holds an interesting gun made from two tan teeth, a Collectable Minifigure ray gun, and a purple cone. I would have liked to see another included but it would not be too hard to make another from spare parts lying around!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is short of course due to the small size of the model. It does however utilise a couple of interesting construction techniques including some nice double layered hinges to make the wings on the flying vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When its is all together the set is quite a sight. There are only three small models, but all are great, especially the alien flyer with its beautiful curves. I like the Avenging Cycle, it is mostly made up of the motorbike chassis and the red covering with headlights and a couple of grills but I think it looks good despite its simplicity. There is a place to clip on the shield when it is not in use which is nice to see and allows Captain America to sit comfortably on his bike. There are sadly three stickers on this piece, the stars on each side of the vehicle, and the logo on the front, but it does look better with them on in my opinion.</p><p>The tiny turret is decent as well, it is very simple but is functional with an easily flicked flick fire missile, even for big hands! The gold pieces look good on here and despite their villainous nature, I certainly appreciate the aliens' style!</p><p>Finally, the flyer is my favourite component of the set. It has three more stickers with some more gold and purple on the big curved slope pieces which I like and plenty more gold. The flick fire&nbsp;missile&nbsp;slung underneath fits&nbsp;seamlessly&nbsp;into the design and there are two jets on the back of the ship. The driver must stand up to fly the vehicle but has no control panel! Perhaps he controls it by telepathy?</p><p>The three Minifigures all go nicely with the set and I really add some playability. At this price point this is about as good as it gets.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you are looking for an affordable, but outstanding Lego set, look no further than this one. It is flawless in my opinion. If you do not like stickers perhaps the six in the set could be an issue, but they are all easy to apply and really add to the look of the set. The figures are all must haves, so if you would prefer to pass up on the main set (although I would recommend buying it), I would advise everyone to at least get their hands on a Captain America minifigure if they can. The&nbsp;playability is brilliant, the display potential is incredible, and it really is a must buy.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"dragon_teenager","2012-04-08T18:54:55.197Z","And so begins the Marvel wave!","When I saw the full line of Marvel sets on the shelves of my local Wal-Mart, I knew I had to pick up one of them. Being on a budget, I went with the smallest set of the wave, but after putting it together I have no doubt that the rest of them will one day be mine!<br><br>This is the only set to include a Captain America minifigure (to my knowledge), which is one of the main reasons why I got it. I'm sure that will be the selling point for most people, so I'll talk about the minifigures first:<br><br>Captain America himself does not disappoint. His colors are dead-on, with lovingly detailed prints on both sides of the torso. Rather than having a helmet like the other Marvel minifigures, his mask is simply printed onto his head. Nothing to complain about here. His shield, in particular, is fantastic - LEGO really nailed the shape and size of his trademark ""weapon"". If a LEGO Captain America is reason enough to get this set, then by all means, pick this up!<br><br>Obviously there's been much less excitement over the Avengers ""alien"" antagonists from the new movie than the hero minifigures themselves, but in my opinion, these little guys are just as cool as the rest of them. Both aliens are unique, although the difference is subtle at first glance because of their aesthetic. They both sport back printing, including prints on the back of their heads. Lots of fantastic detail on both figs, and frankly I think these guys are just as cool as the Captain himself. Lots of possibility! <br><br>The set is worth the asking price for the figs alone, but if you're looking for a solid play experience to go with your minifigs, you might be left wanting a little more. Captain America's bike is nice enough, although very basic (only about ten parts in total). It does include a hinge to store the Captain's shield when he's not tossing it at evildoers, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, the stickers really do add a lot to the model's look, so if you like to leave them off it may look a little bare. If nothing else, the bike has some MOCing potential. <br><br>The alien vessels are okay. The small flick-fire ""turret"" is worthless, seeing as it doesn't even rotate. Seems pretty inefficient to have to wait for your enemy to line up precisely with your weapon, doesn't it? At least it gives one of the aliens something to stand behind. The other vessel, some sort of hovercraft, fairs a little better. It includes some interesting parts, like trans-purple cones and four golden claw pieces along the wings. Once put together, it looks quite nice, especially with an alien pilot. A slight drawback presents itself with the massively distracting sticker sheet, which is again necessary to prevent the model from looking very bland. Another problem is the fact that the alien's weapon can't comfortably point outside of the frontal shield. It does, but it looks a bit awkward.<br><br>All in all, this set is worth the money if you're buying it for the minifigures. For $11.99, the actual set is a tougher sell, but a nice exclusive minifigure and a handful of interesting parts make it a nice impulse buy. Is it the best Marvel set? Probably not, but I quite enjoyed it. I give this set high marks!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3
"cadwindu1996","2012-04-11T14:22:00.987Z","Cap's ready to defend the red white and blue!.......","<p>......However&nbsp;from who is unspecified.The avengers sets have finally arived i had been greatly anticipating the sets as the movie itself looks awesome.Being a long time marvel fan I have always wished for lego to make marvel sets but always had to settle for somewhat rubbsh mega blocks sets!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Box: The box is a nice dark red which really suits the marvel line and gives a good contrast to the dark blue of the dc sets.The art itself is excellent and depicts cap riding his cycle into battle against aliens?! The picture of the lego avengers in the corner is inspired and gives the sets a unique feel there is also on the base of the box a picture of the avengers in real life from the movies which looks awesome!The back demonstrates the play features of the set and has sound effect words which is kind of&nbsp;funny but unimportant!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Parts: There are some nice parts in the set including some nice purple and dark tan peices along with cap's awesome shield.There are also stickers which are required to add detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build:&nbsp;A monkey could build this set as it has a very easy but entertaining build</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigs:This is where the set shines as it includes two exclusive figures and one figure that is in the quinjet set! firstly we have the star spangled man himself captain america who is perfect down to every last detail from his well detailed head and torso which is double sided, to his shield which is totally unique and very well designed!</p>
<p>The second minifigures are the general and the foot soldier for loki's mystery army as seen in the avengers trailers and tv spots! The general is a nice dark grey with a gold head which looks really good and his torso and legs are finely detailed with purple and silver for his armour.The foot soldier is a light grey colour with the gold head that is the same sort of design but uniquely different which is a bonus the torso and legs also depict armour with purple and silver but include lighter silver and different colouring, both minifigs have purple hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set: The set includes three sections.&nbsp;First is the motor cycle which is the same mold as the catwoman motorcycle but in dark red it also has symbols of both shield and the captain america insignia which are sadly stickers however they don't look half bad.The next part is the flick missile turret yep it is official very set has flick missiles the turret is boring and plain but it adds something, i don't know what yet though!The speeder is very cool and is simple but on display looks awesome and has some good (sticker) detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall:&nbsp;I would give this set a 9/10 it is really nice and has some good figures however an extra soldier or perhaps&nbsp;agent coulson or nick fury would not have gone amiss here to make the count up to four figures as then it would match the star wars&nbsp;£12 set ammount of&nbsp;minfigs.Apart from that i am very impressed and look forward to purchasing and reviewing more marvel and avengers sets!</p>

"Big_Green","2012-05-09T12:05:27.77Z","Good Starter Set","<p>When I first saw this set at the toy fair I thought that I would probably give this a miss. But now I am so glad that I decided to get it! Lets start with the figs:</p>
<p>CAPTAIN AMERICA</p>
<p>Wow. He is just too cool. I really love him, and the fact that he is exclusive to this set makes him seem a whole lot better! His shield is awsome too. The only bad things are that his head printing is a bit scruffy, and he should have a helmet in stead of printing.</p>
<p>ALIEN GENERAL</p>
<p>I feel sorry for these guys. Most people think that they are rubbish and belong in the bin, but I think he is so awsome! His printing is really detailed and I love his pearl gold head. And like Captain America, he is exclusive to this set.</p>
<p>ALIEN FOOT SOLDIER</p>
<p>Again, like the general, I love this guy. There's not much to say as he is similar to the general, but he does come with a gun thingy. The gun is a little over sized, but they are kinda like that in the movie.</p>
<p>That was the figs. Next up is the set itself.</p>
<p>THE TURRET</p>
<p>This is a cool little extra to this set as they did'nt have any turrets in the movie. It has the same colours as the aliens and the hand held gun.</p>
<p>THE SHIP</p>
<p>This was in the movie, but they were a bit bigger. Again it has the same colours as the turret and aliens. I love the use of the Ninjago swords as the wing blades!</p>
<p>THE BIKE</p>
<p>This, like the turret never appeared in the movie, but that does'nt stop it from looking brilliant. The colours match Cap perfectly and the little clip to hold his shield is a nice little touch too.</p>
<p>That was Captain America's Avenging Cycle. Overall I think i would give this set a 8/10. Thanks for reading!</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-04T21:08:36.057Z","An American in LEGO.","<div>The legendary Captain America has finally made it into Minifig form, and he rides around on his quote-unquote Avenging Cycle, ready and waiting to throw his shield and some unsuspecting alien goons and thereby bringing peace and justice to this great ol’ United States of America.</div><div><br></div><div>The almost inevitable jingoism associated with a superhero named Captain America has certainly been tuned down over the years as society’s tastes and expectations have become somewhat more sophisticated, and in spite of perceptions perhaps turning against the United States in recent years, there is no doubt that Captain America remains the central figure in the Marvel Universe - at least as far as mainstream comic book continuity goes, anyway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Contents-wise, this set sort of has vague similarities to Golden Staff Guardians (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7306-1"">7306</a>), in that it has three Minifigs, a motorcycle, and a small build (with an almost identical number of pieces) to supplement it. This being a licensed set, the Avenging Cycle comes in at a suggested retail price of $3, which I suppose is the premium one pays for owning the First Avenger. Of course, I have little doubt that the primary attraction for buying this set would be Captain America himself, and he is a great Minifig to have. He's got no flashy parts or outlandish accessories, but he's extremely detailed and is bound to please. Mercifully, his shield is a printed piece and NOT a sticker, which have annoyed me to the ends of the earth and so I'm glad it did not happen. The other two Minifigs are a pair of alien goons that are, luckily, sufficiently different from each other, although since neither of them represent anything directly from the comics, I don't feel a whole lot of affinity or use for them accept to have them leer menacingly at my townsfolk.</div><div><br></div><div>The Avenging Cycle is, um, okay, I suppose. It's quite bit heavier and sufficiently different from the usual town motorcyles and the ""old school"" ones (such as that which is present in Golden Staff Guardians, incidentally), and it is adorned with SHIELD logos (and frustrating tiny circular stickers, neither of which I applied) as well as an expected red, white, and blue motif for added patriotism. More interesting is the little alien ship, which actually has a pretty interesting build and features a number of neat decorative pieces, including some transparent purple missiles which is a colour I have not seen used before. The small missile turret is a decent add-on to further bolster the piece count. It's nothing to write home about, but I guess it's fun to have more things to pelt poor Steve Rogers with.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Let's face it: the only reason that you would want to get this set is for Captain America, and so it would be more or less appropriate to call this set ""CAPTAIN AMERICA and also some bits and bobs"". The motorcycle and the alien battle setpieces are fun and look good, make no mistake, but the question is whether you think it's worth it to plow $13 into this set or to just cough up for Captain America separately on BrickLink. I personally do not regret it. That being said, the components of this set do work well, and I'm sure kids especially will get a blast out of the motorcycle and the alien goons to battle. AFOLs who are also Marvel fans may have to weigh their options a little more carefully.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,1
"woodall_aidan","2012-07-11T13:11:23.88Z","Stars and Stripes!","This is one of the few really good $12.99 sets. It includes Captain America, with his shield. Captain America also came with his Avenging Cycle, which, I guess, is supposed to also be from Captain America: The First Avenger, but the Cycle has the S.H.I.E.L.D logo on it.<br>Next are the alien figures. There is an alien soldier and an alien commander. The figures look the same, but you can tell the difference by seeing which figure has a dark bluish gray torso and dark bluish gray legs. The commander comes with a small gold and tan glider with transparent purple missiles. He also has a small tan and silver blaster with a purple tip. The soldier has a small gold and tan launcher base with a purple flick fire missile. Everything in the set was well, and it gets a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-27T12:12:30.25Z","The First Avenger","<p>Set #6865 Captain America's Avenging Cycle: Basing the Marvel Super Heroes sets on the Avengers means that not all fans of Marvel will find this set to their liking, mostly due to the fact that the Mini-Figures are inspired pretty much by the film and if you don't care for their design you're not going to immediately want to run out and snag sets featuring those designs over the more traditional comic book looks. That being said, this is a pretty impressive set.</p>
<p>This set is priced at 15.99$ in Canada, a dollar more for essentially a Battle Pack style set compared to past years, there are only three Mini-Figs and if you are unfortunate enough to find this set at TRU you're asked to pay 17.99$ because of their recent practice of raising the base prices every time they have a % off sale. (Just so they can milk you for every cent you're worth, filthy habit.) The contents however, for fans of Marvel and especially Marvel's Avengers are well worth the initial Wal-Mart aproved asking price. (Avoid TRU like the plague, even if they claim it's on sale, it really isn't. In fact RCSS in Canada had this set on sale just before the holidays for 12.97$ a much better asking price, and I hope many of your parents got it for you then.)</p>
<p>You have two vehicles in the set and one tiny defensive position for the Alien Foot Soldier, you recieve three Mini-Figures (Personally I think it should have featured at least two Foot Soldiers for the Alien General to command, or perhaps even a Maria Hill or Shield Agent Coulsen Mini-Fig, as it is after all the same price as Star Wars Battle Packs and those get you 4 Mini-Figs consistently at that price.)</p>
<p>The small flick-fire missile based play feature is, pretty boring honestly, I mean it looks cool due to the color choice used for the parts, but looks aren't everything as it doesn't have much functionality outside of the flick-fire missile. It isn't on a swivel plate, it can't be aimed at Mini-Figs like Iron-Man or Thor while they are flying and it would make the Hulk smash it faster than a mosquito being squished by a regular person. Still it does offer up some bit of playability, and the parts have some nice color choices.</p>
<p>The Alien General's Chariot, or Flying-Attack Craft, or whatever it's meant to be is a much better buildable model. Not only because of the gold colors and moveable wings (though they don't move too far), but also because of the accuracy to the on-screen version we've seen during the film. It's a great looking little vehicle with some useful pieces, if you got two of this set, aside from winding up with Two Caps and his Cycle you'd at least have two of this to flank the larger craft Loki is using in the Hellicarrier set. And that's just something no good diorama can do without.</p>
<p>Cap's Avenging Cycle, despite the questionable nature of the name, sounds like something out of the 80's, is a really great looking piece. We've seen it many times before, the basic body of the bike has been around since at least 2006 as the first Catwoman set included it then, it could even be earlier than that as LEGO City Police officers employ it in white. However I believe this is the first time we've seen it in this rich dark red/maroon color. It uses some stickers for detail work, the Shield logo and a couple of Cap Symbols, and it does have a bit of stability issues. I really wish LEGO would just include the parts that Catwoman's cycle used as hidden kick-stands/supports to prevent it from falling over sideways at every jostle. It's a minor complaint though, and it does include a clip for Cap's sheild when he's driving so that's a bonus.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are all bald, no seriously they don't include any head gear, everything is printed. Cap's Mask, the Alien General and Foot Soldier's helmets, they are all printed detail for the Mini-Figures. On the one hand this is some impressive detail work, on the other however it does mean no unique new head pieces for MOCs which would have been interesting to see. Each Mini-Figure features a double-sided torso, great looking printing on the legs for the aliens and back printing on the heads. (Cap's is just one little seam or line indicating his mask, but at least there is something. The two aliens really shine out more with the back printing on the heads.)</p>
<p>Accessories include two key items, Cap's Shield, the new round shield piece with the traditional red and blue circling a white star, and a built-up gun for the Alien General. (Not the Foot Soldier according to the instructions.) The shield is iconic and looks great, it's nice to see it along with the Cap Mini-Fig. The gun is just a few pieces slapped onto that new Space era blaster piece from the CMF Series, the colors are nice and it does match up to the show, but I found it a bit tricky to get the weapon to actually fit right in the Mini-Figures hand.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is good for what it is, a cheap little parts pack with some great Mini-Figures and the only way to own Captain America in Mini-Figure form, at least for the moment, however it needs just a tiny bit more to be truly outstanding. Personally, I would have liked to have seen either a Maria Hill, Agent Coulson or Shield Trooper Mini-Fig, truly make this a worthy battle pack even if you would wind up with multiple Captain Americas when buying two or more for army building, and the small flick-fire missile launcher could have used a few minor tweaks to make it really stand out. Something so you can aim it, turn it to face the enemy from any approach, and maybe an extra gun for the soldier manning it in case someone breaks through the defensive line to attack him. Still I reccomend this set, I do however offer up a word of caution. This is probably just a one off production error, but my Alien Foot Soldier's head has some noticeable gashes on it from where the factory machine pushed down too hard on the softer gold plastic. It is a minor blemish and eventually I may get around to asking LEGO Customer Service about replacing it, but for the moment there's nothing really wrong with the Mini-Fig and unless you're really looking for it you won't notice this issue. Either way it seems to be an isolated case, as other reviewers I've read don't seem to have this issue. Just thought I'd share this information so that you are aware.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

I'd been saving up for Minecraft, but it can now wait. I bought Cap at Target, and I am very pleased. My initial reaction to the set being a bit expensive turned into a realization of the possibilities of the playability and actual thought of the set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-This is the most authentic replication of Cap's motorcycle that Lego could have possibly done.&nbsp;</li><li>-The excellent minifigures are always a plus; the general and foot soldier Chitauri all look very different and recognizable, and Cap looks very realistic.&nbsp;</li><li>-The Chitauri general's ride is pretty sweet, along with the entire color scheme, Ninjago weapons, and missiles of both weapon arsenals.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Stickers somehow sneak in to this set. No idea how, but you know that I really hate them above all else.&nbsp;</li><li>-Cap is mainly blue when it comes to color, so why did Lego make it red? This is a bit of an issue to me since I'm all about Cap. To me, replace red with blue, and vice versa.&nbsp;</li><li>-I also feel that the set could have included one more minifig, such as Hawkeye or Black Widow, to make the set more evenly grounded, and better priced.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Captain America's Lego debut is excellent, cute, and even a bit imaginative. Cap only had a motorcycle when he went home, but never used it during battle. Therefore, this set is much more interesting than it could have been had it been strictly movie material. Good job Lego. I highly recommend that you get this set if you like Cap or Marvel in general.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"B_Scheibs","2012-06-05T18:01:25.097Z","Battle on the Streets of New York!","Captain America's Avenging Cycle is the smallest Super Heroes set so far from both DC and Marvel. It has 72 pieces, 3 figures, and costs 12.99, putting us at 18 cents per piece, which in my opinion is very high. When this set was first unveiled at the New York Toy Fair, I was ANGRY! I couldn't believe LEGO would sell a motorcycle and one figure for only $13! Luckily, a final picture showing the alien soldiers surfaced on the internet, and I calmed down a bit. But it still seemed too small for a 12.99 set. Was I right or was I wrong?<br><br>You get three figures in this set, but there is one that stands out. Of course, it's Captain America, who is exclusive to this set. Both his front and back printing are great and stay accurate, but they didn't print his red boots. Still, the figure looks awesome! One thing I noticed was the helmet/mask is printed on the face, which I do like. However, the Captain is very tan, but I guess there wasn't much that could be done about that. The shield is EXCELLENT! It's size accurate, perfectly printed, and goes great with the Captain. This is the reason you should buy this set as this is the only way to get him! <br><br>The aliens are cool, too. The foot soldier comes in a lighter gray, has a bit of leg printing, front and back printing, and a double printed (not double sided since there is no extra face) golden head. The general has slightly different and more printing than the foot soldier, and comes in a darker gray. I find his unique gun very cool though, and it works well with the figure. The nice part is that he is exclusive to this set. Overall, the aliens are nice, but don't differ to greatly. I can see some people army building with these figures to get a big alien army for Loki.<br><br>The actual set has 3 parts, but I really only like one. The aliens come with a little cannon that launches a tiny flick-fire missile. Yay, we ALWAYS need more of those. The ship is interesting though since I like the gold and tan colors, and the Ninjago blade pieces work well. There are stickers though, but they do add nice detail and are clear-backed, but not necessary. And of course, a flick missile. Great. The ship looks nice, but doesn't have much to it.<br><br>The Avenging Cycle was never in the movie, yet LEGO made it. I'm not too fond of the name, but it really does look like a motorcycle Captain America would use. You can clip the shield on the back, which is a nice touch, and I really like the stickers, as it makes the bike feel like it really is Captain America's. It would have been cool if LEGO designed a similar motorcycle using the Wolverine's chopper mold, but this really does look great!<br><br>As an overall set, it's decent, but not great. And I was right about it being too small, as there isn't much to offer here. You will get some good playability out of it, but the missile cannon can go, and the alien ship is just average. The true star of the set is Captain America, and the alien soldiers are nice to include as well. Putting the set aside, is it worth the 13 bucks to get the figures? For me- yes! The price per piece may be bad, but Captain America definitely makes up for it, so I can see lot's of people buying the set for him. As an overall set though, I don't think it was as good as it could have been, and LEGO could have put in more. I can't go low since it's not bad, but it's definitely not a 5, so I give it a 3 out of 5. It's middle of the road for Super Heroes, and you're better off spending your money on something else if you don't want the Captain America figure as badly as some others might. I hope you enjoyed reading my review, and that you found it useful.- Bricklife4809<br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"plantman","2012-09-03T05:11:42.07Z","Excited for anything Marvel, disappointed they went with Movie them...","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, value for money is great at $13.&nbsp; Build is easy, seems like kids would love playing with this set.&nbsp; You get Cap on a cycle and two aliens with a flying ship.&nbsp; I rated this set purely on it's own merit - it is a good set.&nbsp; As a comic fan until my college years, however, I am supremely disappointed in the overall Movie theme that was chosen for the Marvel sets.  With DC we get classic figures and sets that seem like they could have been in a comic.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish we could have seen this with Marvel.   I loved the movie, but didn't want movie sets.  I wanted classic comic costumes and characters - would have LOVED a classic Cap instead of this, with the red skull or some other villain.&nbsp; The movie aliens where cool - in the movie.  I feel they went the wrong route with this theme, but it is aimed at kids after all....</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-10-27T00:04:34.637Z","A Capsicle No More!","<p>In what may be one of the best sets of 2012, Captain America makes his Lego minifigure debut alongside the other Avengers. And he makes one great set!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows a scene in which Cap is riding. Along on his S.H.I.E.L.D bike, fighting a couple of Chatauri minions of Loki&#39;s. The instructions are short, and are very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes the large motorcycle piece in a nice dark red, and also includes many dark tan sandy piece, along with various golds and purples, both solid and transparent. It also includes the new shield piece, for which Cap can throw at the intergalactic invaders.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two exclusive minifigure, Cap and the alien general.</p>

<p><strong>Captain America:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone&#39;s favorite shield throwing hero appears in his classic red, white, and blue apparel, but this time in darker toend colors. He wears his mask with an &quot;A&quot; for America, and is holding on to his Vibranium shield, with the same color coding as his outfit.</p>

<p><strong>Chatauri&nbsp;General and Footsoldier: </strong>They are some&nbsp;mean-looking&nbsp;aliens. The detail on this year&#39;s aliens from the theme is fantastic, and is mainly dark grey and gold. They have an alien mask, and many other metallic looking objects in his armor. The Footsoldier&nbsp;is also included in set 6869.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>In what is an easy and very short build, you can create a battlefield. The set doesn&#39;t take very long to construct at all, and includes 4 or 5 stickers.The build for the motorcycle is basically stacking pieces&nbsp;on top of others, and as for the others, well, like I said, it&#39;s all pretty easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Thg completed model builds a nice battle pack, with the great motorcycle for Cap, and a nice speeder and turret for the aliens. The set is a good one for display, and goes wonderfully with the other sets in the theme, and is a fun little build for poops and giggles. Otherwise, it&#39;s just great for kids and collectors alike.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, the set is a great little model. As with all sets in the theme, the set is great. There is a great assortment of minifigures, and the set is pretty good for its price. I&#39;d most definitely recommend you buy it. It&#39;s also a good set to get Cap in, and otherwise he&#39;s rumored to appear in a 2015 set with the new (also rumored) Quinjet.</p>

"thechabear","2015-05-08T18:40:03.667Z","the first avenger or is he","<p>well this is my first marvel and my 1st review and today we have captain americas avenging cycle. It retailed&nbsp;for $12.00 in the usa and this is the only set with ca. So lets get into the review</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is small like a normal battle pack size and the art work is really good.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some parts that are really good in this set are the purple tipped missiles, the cycle parts and itself, the shield&nbsp;that ca has, and the minifig parts. So parts are really good</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>CAPTAIN AMERICA: This is the first version of captain america. This is a really good one as it has the dark blue insted of the light blue from the 2014 one. He has a big A on top and he has back printing on the head and the torso. He has no leg printing which is a shame. But overall this is the main reason why you are getting this set.</p>

<p><img src=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sHxlzU6aL.jpg"" /></p>

<p>CHATARI&nbsp;MINIFIGS: Ah yes the chatari and the chatari general. The general is exclusive and his weapon is a op ray gun. &nbsp;He has the same printing as the foot soldier but darker. As for the soldier, his weapon of choice is his fist. He has lighter printing then the general. Both have back printing on the head and torso and they also have a bit of leg printing</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/b/b5/Sh030.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width/250?cb=20120610103034"" /><img src=""http://ck.lnwfile.com/044q9p.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build was short but fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">MOTORCYCLE: The motorcycle is awesome but it is loaded up with stickers, 3 to be exact. There is a place on the back of his motorcycle that has a clip to hold his shield. There is nothing left to say about this cycle</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">CHATARI&nbsp;MISSILE LAUNCHER: This is the smallest build of the 3. It can move up and down a bit and it has two&nbsp;studs in the front to put a&nbsp;minifig. The&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;can not launch the weapon, so overall the&nbsp;weakest&nbsp;build of the 3.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">CHATARI FLYER: &nbsp;This build was the most complex out of the 3 (but it was not complex at all). This build can seat 2 minifigs. The soldier can fly it while the general can shoot while on the flyer. The flyers wings can move up and down on hinges. This vehicle only has one weapon and that is the flick missiles under the flyer. It is hard to fire it but you can do it in about a minute. Overall it is a good vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set has 2 exclusive minifigs, 2 builds, 3 minifigs in total, and it retails for $12.00. It is great for kids as you can put the captain on his bike and put the two chataris&nbsp;on the flyer and you can pretend the general is firing at captain america&nbsp;while flying and he is on the bike. For collectors it is a ok set as they may already have the foot soldier from the quinjet but they need captain america to complete the avengers. So it&#39;s a good price and build for them too. Overall the set is a little battle pack but a really good one at that.</p>

"DefinitelyJY","2015-06-23T15:19:40.41Z","The First Avenger!!!","<p>Hello everyone my name is DesertKiller and I&#39;ll be doing a review of this set 6865: Captain America&#39;s Avenging Cycle. I got this set when I was going on a holiday to the Western part of Indonesia. I bought this in a little shop that belongs to an AFOL in Indonesia. the price there was Rp 350.000 which is approx USD 26.92. Yeah I know expensive right???&nbsp; Well welcome to Indonesia. But anyways let&#39;s start the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of this set is very fragile, the cardboard used here is very thin, so becareful when you want this box perfect.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>We get 72 parts which is around Rp 4861 or USD 0.37. The most interesting part is Captain America&#39;s Shield. But I don&#39;t care about part price because it&#39;s really not important.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Captain America</p>

<p>We got the first Captain America from this set. Everything looks perfect accept for the skintone of Captain America but still an awesome minifigure to complete your Avengers.</p>

<p>Chitauri General</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember seeing this in the Avengers movie maybe LEGO made a variation to the Chitauri minifigure.</p>

<p>Chitauri Soldier</p>

<p>This minifigure isn&#39;t 100% accurate but it&#39;s quite impressive that they could make a Chitauri minifigure so simplified.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>We get Captain America&#39;s Cycle, a Chitauri Canon and a Chitauri Flying Ship.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I bought this set only to get the first Avenger Captain America</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is OK. It has some playabillities and if you want to make a Chitauri Army you could buy this set</p>

"BuffaloDelorean","2017-05-04T01:40:22.113Z","Captain America, but not much else.","<p>I found this set pretty unimpressive, personally, but it&#39;s not without its good points.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>The parts selection certainly isn&#39;t bad, but it isn&#39;t particularly impressive, either. The only things that really stood out to me (besides the minifigures&nbsp;and the big, ugly motorbike), were the tan tooth plates, the blue &quot;cheese grater&quot; slope, the large dark tan slopes, and the transparent purple cones.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Captain America is the character this set is named after, and is really the only reason to buy it. It&#39;s a well-detailed figure, although it seems too dark overall. I would have had it use bright red in place of dark red, and maybe even bright blue. It looks fine as it is, but some of the detail is lost in the dark plastic.</p>

<p>The two Chitauri, the general and the soldier, aren&#39;t as desirable as the Captain, but they don&#39;t have any real issues. The lackluster character designs make for lackluster minifigures, but that&#39;s hardly Lego&#39;s fault. The print is even more detailed than Captain America&#39;s, and they have leg printing that he lacks. The purple hands look a little out of place, though, and it&#39;s a little disappointing that only one of them has a weapon. Still, the gun that is included is uninspiring, so it&#39;s no big loss.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to the build, which is unsurprising given the size of the set. There&#39;s nothing tedious or confusing (although the six stickers a bit of a pain), but it adds nothing to my enjoyment.</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model is a bit of a mixed bag. I understand the use of prefabricated parts for smaller minifigure-scale vehicles, but any benefit that may have had in the set was lost with the unattractive, oversized, motorbike fairing. Add to that the fact that it has no basis in the <em>Avengers</em> movie, and the Avenging Cycle that makes up the other half of this set&#39;s name is easily its weakest link.</p>

<p>Next up is the Chitauri turret. This model is exceedingly simple. It seems like an odd complaint for a set of this size, but it seems like an afterthought, and the design is so bland that I have to think there were better options. Even leaving off this piece entirely to reduce the price would have been preferable.</p>

<p>Luckily, things get much better with the Chitauri flyer. This is the most complex and attractive model of the three, and I was surprised how much I liked the design. The Lego Marvel Superheroes theme has always been at its best with spaceships, jets, and other aircraft, and this little model fits that category quite well. The build is a bit too small to be truly imposing, but it serves its purpose well, and is one of the better models in smaller licensed theme sets. Maybe it could be slightly more substantial if the budget allocated to the turret and motorbike had been spent here instead.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has one &quot;must-have&quot; minifigure, two that are simply well-done, a pair of unappealing builds, and a surprisingly good one. This is the only way to get&nbsp;<em>Avengers&nbsp;</em>Cap, and it&#39;s nice enough as part of a larger display (if you ignore the motorbike), but on its own, this set doesn&#39;t do much to earn the $13 US it costs.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2020-07-11T20:32:06.483Z","An absolutely classic Lego Marvel set!","<p><b>Introduction: </b>Back in 2012 Lego decided to take a risk on The Avengers film possibly being a successful theme. Since then, Lego Marvel has been one of Legos themes, but looking back on the original sets, do they still hold up? Or are they only worth the nostalgia that comes with the film? Let&rsquo;s dive into this classic set that helped start it all.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures: </b>Beginning on the Chitauri soldiers, these figures were recently reimagined for the recent Avengers Endgame sets, but in my opinion the originals are the best. Both aliens are different one with a light grey body color and the other with dark grey. I&rsquo;m very impressed with Lego deciding to make them different instead of the same. This begins the theme of the henchmen like villains, but does it better by putting in the quality and time to distinguish the figures. Sadly, by Age of Ultron we weren&rsquo;t getting separate distinguished henchmen, they were all the same figure thrown into the set. The same goes for the Outriders from Infinity War and now the AIM agents during this 2020 Marvel&nbsp;wave. But back to looking at the figures themselves, both have a nicely detailed gold head with very intriguing facial expressions. Each of them have the same torso printings, just printed on different color torsos. The detailing there is nice although it lacks detailed printing on the back. Both figures also have nice leg printing and I&rsquo;m still, as mentioned before, greatly glad that Lego went with two different colors for the figures. As far as accuracy to the film goes I must admit they do well in that category too. Moving on now from the Chitauri to Captain America. The figure here is absolutely perfect, I love head print and the torso printing, I do wish it had included leg printing, but looking at the films, they remained accurate to the context. The silver especially stands out on the figure and looks very nice as well as the thorough printing along the back. I truly believe this figure is more valuable due to its reappearance in Avengers Endgame, I believe that a person hoping to have a minifigure showcase from that film would truly be at a loss without this spectacular Captain America figure. He also comes with a rare dark red shield that only appeared in this set.</p>

<p><b>Build: </b>The Builds in this set are what you&rsquo;d expect out of something with this price, but they still do look great. Starting with Captain America&rsquo;s bike, many people have stated that it is oversized, and I&rsquo;d agree, but I&rsquo;d like to point out that they&rsquo;ve since corrected that mistake, as well as the fact that there was literally a humorously large motorcycle included in the Endgame wave that was much larger than this one here. The bike here features nice Captain America shield sticker on each lower corner as well as a nice S.H.I.E.l.D. logo on the front. There is also nice mirrors included in the front and a place to clip the shield on in the back. Moving on to the small missile launcher build. It properly blends the gold and the sand beige into a very nice color scheme that appears here and on the Chitauri hover craft. The missile launcher is a very welcome addition and I&rsquo;m happy Lego made the choice to include it instead of only having the motorcycle and hovercraft in the set. The hovercraft is a very articulate build that showcases many fun building techniques and looks like it came right out of the film too. There is room on top of the hover craft for both Chitauri and it has wing-like structures that can move on the sides. This build was redone in the Hulk Helicopter Drop set from Endgame, but I believe this one here is the better of the two. So that&rsquo;s all for the Build and Minifigures let&rsquo;s move on to the final verdict</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>So, my opinion might be slightly bias because it&rsquo;s mixed with the memories of first getting this set leading up to the blockbuster film, but then again all reviews are simply opinions so here&rsquo;s mine, I think this set is one of the greatest small sets Marvel has ever done, and what I mean by that is that as far as these $10-$20 sets go, this one brings the most to the table. The minifigure choices all make sense, the builds are all very nice, I believe this set is only rivaled by another one of my favorite Marvel sets, the Outrider Ship set from Infinity War, but to compare the two is insane, so judging it in its own context it&rsquo;s a great set. So that&rsquo;s my review!</p>

<p>Great set for the characters, but lacks due to the price to part ratio. Playability is ok, but not much to do except with your imagination. There isn&#39;t much of a building experience as the most exciting part is the cycle which is finished in like a minute. The parts are ok.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-09-06T14:59:47.85Z","PLAYABILITY is great, but the price...","<p>Hello!&nbsp;Sideswinger here, reviewing&nbsp;Captain America&#39;s Avenging Cycle. This was released in 2012 to coincide with the 2012 Marvel&#39;s Avengers movie, and it includes 72 pieces. It retailed for $12.99, which is typically a bad price for a set with 72 pieces, but maybe it could be excused here. We&#39;ll discuss the price a little later.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>The minifigure selection here is pretty great, but I do feel like it&#39;s missing another character. I think maybe another chitauri minifigure would have been fantastic. I do love how this includes two exclusive figures, however, the first being that amazing Captain America figure, sporting his suit from the 2012 film, which was created using some insight from Agent Phil Coulson. The design is integrated very well into a LEGO Minifigure, but I do think the blue tone needs to be a slightly lighter shade. The printing on the head is surprisingly good, with that white &quot;A&quot; on top, and the printing on that torso is amazingly accurate. But honestly, that shield is my favourite part of the figure, because if you ask me, it&#39;s the best representation of Cap&#39;s shield in any Marvel Super Heroes set, mostly because of how fantastic that dark red colour is. The second exclusive figure is that Chitauri General, which is a character I honestly don&#39;t&nbsp;think ever appeared in the film. Still, the printing on it is good, though it varies pretty slightly from the other Chitauri figure. Speaking of which, that Chitauri soldier is nothing exclusive, having came in the big Quinjet set of the same year. This is the cheapest way to get him, though, by a long shot. Again, I wish two of those Chitauri soldiers were included just to make it more complete, but perhaps that&#39;s my anxiety-filled self talking, because all-in-all, the minifigure selection in this cheap a set is pretty fantastic.</p>

<p>Builds:</p>

<p>This set includes a few very small builds, the first being the namesake of the set, Cap&#39;s avenging cycle. I do love the dark red colour for that motorcycle base, and the stickers on the front and sides add a nice level of detail. With that being said, that build, despite it being the namesake of the set, never appeared in the film whatsoever. The other two builds are tiny in size, and the smaller of the two never appeared in the film either. But on the bright side, that flying hovercraft was very prominent&nbsp;in the movie, and it looks pretty good here. I love the gold colour mingled in, and that big sticker on the slope piece is pretty detailed, and it looks great.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>the building process is nothing too special, since all of the builds are tiny and don&#39;t really provide that much of a building experience. The set isn&#39;t really made for the build-up though, and it&#39;s more of a playset overall.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>the playability of this set is pretty splendid, in my personal opinion. The minifigures are all great inclusions, which can perhaps battle with each other if you have that imagination; and when I was younger, I personally always loved playing with LEGO motor-bikes, so I can guess&nbsp;that bike amps&nbsp;up the play value. Also, that Chitauri minifigure and push-missile can be fun to play around with as well. All in all, I think the playability this set provides is excellent.</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;ll be honest, the 13 dollar price tag&nbsp;is not a great value, since the builds are pretty tiny and only three figures are included. All of the builds are tiny and insubstantial, and ultimately, this set should be 10 dollars. But with that being said, the two exclusive figures are great inclusions, and I do like the inclusion of that Chitauri soldier, though I wish a second one was integrated. I think the strongest aspect of this set is the playability, which is out of this world, if you ask me. Overall, with all things considered, I am gonna give this set a 4 out of 5. That is it for his review, so thanks for reading!</p>

<p><strong>Captain America&#39;s bike</strong> is exclusive to this set. I like that the bike can house Captain&#39;s shield. Also,&nbsp;I like how the red colour suits the Captain America&#39;s theme. However, if you are looking at accuracy to the movie then of course it is not accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Chitauri General&#39;s Craft</strong> is an awesome piece. Personally i think it is quite similar to the movie. I also like how you can house both Chitauri minifigures on this craft, as seen in the movie. It can also shoot a missile.</p>

<p><strong>Chitauri Foot Soldier stand</strong> with missile is like a tactical ground attack. It can adjust the angle and&nbsp;shoot the missile upward&nbsp;and forward. This stand makes it more realistic in play where you have air and ground attack.</p>

<p><strong>The other details:</strong>&nbsp;I think these stickers are great add-ons for complexity to the vehicles (Captain America&#39;s bike and the&nbsp;Chitauri&#39;s craft). Just missing stickers for the Chitauri stand.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Love this set and would highly recommend this set for a good price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have taken more pictures&nbsp;of this set, with more details, in my blog below.</p>
