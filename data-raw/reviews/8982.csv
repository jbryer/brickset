"CapnRex101","2012-04-09T18:27:41.653Z","6866 - Wolverine's Chopper Showdown","<p>This is a simply superb set. Every aspect of the model is great from the Minifigures to the helicopter itself and I&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;find a single real flaw. The Minifigures are all beautiful and highly detailed so I love those and it is great to finally see a Lego Wolverine, a character who many people have been after for quite some time I believe. There are a huge number of unique parts in the set too which are certainly an attraction, and it is nice to see so much dark red as well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is awesome with that dark red bordering and the Super Heroes logo in pride of place. On the top right hand corner of the cover there is an image of Wolverine in his Lego form which looks lovely and in the bottom corner there is the X-Men logo. The shot of the entire set in action is spectacular with the helicopter, piloted by Deadpool, hovering in the air, and Wolverine's motorbike being controlled by Magneto who is levitating off the ground below the chopper. Wolverine is flying through the air at the helicopter with his claws extended ready for battle. Flick fire missiles are firing at him and there are sparks where he has cut one of them in two with his trademark blades which is a nice touch.&nbsp;</p><p>The background is of some kind of rocky valley and there are a few rocks in the foreground where Wolverine has jumped from. I always love how the designers of the packaging at Lego create a sense of movement and this artwork is a fine example of this excellence. There is a small gallery image of the Minifigures in the set at the bottom of the cover and a bit of text about the comic included. The back of the box shows off the main features of the set including the flick fire missiles and the spinning rotors. There is also a small picture of Wolverine as he appears in the comics.</p><p>The instructions have the same image and border on them and I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces. The comic is in a separate booklet with a number '1'&nbsp;emblazoned&nbsp;on the front. The adventure is decent with a bit of action and I love the reference to the original comics with the&nbsp;onomatopoeic&nbsp;sounds written across the frames!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The number of exclusive and hard to find parts in this set is incredible. There is a lot of dark red in the model which is a nice colour to see included and a few silver cones for the missiles. The front of the helicopter is formed from a piece which is new to me,&nbsp;however&nbsp;it has been seen before in a couple of the more recent train sets such as set 7939, Cargo Train. I like this part as it is quite&nbsp;versatile&nbsp;I think and could be used for pretty much any vehicle to create an attractive curving shape. It is also good to see so many slopes and the lovely light grey motorbike cover piece which looks great. This is not an exclusive mould as it appeared in set 7196, Chauchilla&nbsp;Cemetery&nbsp;Battle, from the Indiana Jones theme not so long ago. However, it is an exclusive colour and it really suits the mould. We also get one of those fabulous new brackets, and best of all, Wolverine's wonderful claws. We get three as one is spare and they look great and could have quite a few uses in your own creations.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Three Minifigures are included in this set and all of them are splendid. The first of them is <b>Wolverine</b>, he is seen here in his yellow and blue comic book outfit which I much prefer to his appearance in the X-Men movies. The hair is the same as that of the old Joker Minifigure from a few old Batman sets. I was surprised to see this mould&nbsp;resurrected&nbsp;but I am glad it was as it would be nice to see an updated version of the Mark Hamill joker, perhaps as a polybag set! This time the hair is black and it suits Wolverine perfectly, very accurate to his actual appearance in the comics! His face is double sided and looks superb on both sides. One shows an angry face with teeth bared and the signature sideburns which help make him such a legend, there is also a lot of stubble and huge bushy eyebrows. The other side has the same sideburns,&nbsp;stubbly&nbsp;moustache and beard, as well as a straight mouth and more bushy eyebrows!</p><p>The torso is my favourite part. It has lots of very detailed printing, including&nbsp;muscles&nbsp;and a lovely belt with the 'X' symbol on it. Predominantly it is yellow of course with the blue markings reminiscent of tiger striping which look great. His arms are bare and his gloves the same dark blue as the patterns on his chest. The back of his torso also has muscles and striping, as well as a continuation of the belt. However, the best bit is the lovely touch of adding Wolverine's mask folded up hanging down his back! His legs are yellow with a bit more dark blue similar to the torso. The fantastic and obligatory claws have been done really well by Lego in my opinion. He holds them in his hands like the claws from Prince of Persia, but these are a different design to those. They are splayed slightly so as they go further from the base of the claws, they spread out, which is accurate and really makes them a bit more attractive.</p><p><b>Deadpool</b> is another lovely figure. His head piece is mostly red with the two large black eyes that make him so imposing. His two white eyes are printed in the middle of the black areas and he looks great despite the simplistic design. He wears the exact same double katana sheaths on his back as Dastan from Prince of Persia sets which I love. They are held on by a bracket around his neck and his two black swords slide into them nicely and once they are in, they do not fall out unless you pull them which is good. His torso is very nice with muscle detailing and a nice belt, similar to that of Wolverine, but without the 'X'. He has two pairs of pouches on this belt and some black detailing. His arms are black with red gloves which looks nice and realistic. Despite being almost totally obscured by the sheaths, there is back printing of the belt, muscles, and yet more pouches. His red legs are a direct continuation of the torso printing with more black designs and another two brown pouches on his right leg. He carries the exact same gun as the Alien Defence Unit soldiers from the Alien Conquest theme and it suits him so I have no complaints about re-using the piece.</p><p>Finally, <b>Magneto</b> is my favourite component of the entire set. His helmet is a brand new mould and predominantly red with some purple details around the open area on the front of the piece. The entire piece is incredibly accurate to his&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;in the old Marvel comics, especially the little logo shaping above his eyes which is just sublime. His head has one fairly neutral face printed on it with a straight mouth and some bushy grey eyebrows, as well as a few wrinkles, the other side has an identical face with bared teeth, like Wolverine has, but somehow Magneto looks more scared than angry to me. Nevertheless I like the head design on both sides and it would look great for Grand Moff Tarkin from Star Wars, so that is&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;worth keeping in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I adore the purple cape and it would work well on a custom Roman senator or something like that, but it looks just as good here on Magneto. His torso is muscled and has a purple collar with metallic stud work and a little pendant like design beneath that. It is mostly red like the helmet though and that is continued onto his arms and hands, which are purple. There is also back printing even though the cape covers it up of the collar and yet more muscles! His hips are purple and his legs are just plain old red. No complaints from me about that though as it is accurate. He stands on a small round plate which is an interesting little thing to have although in the movies you do see him standing on a small piece of rock when he is levitating so I suppose that is what it is. Whatever it might be, it may come in handy one day!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build does not take too long, about half an hour like Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape and a had a few interesting moments, but in a relatively small set, you cannot reasonably expect much. The rotor blades are&nbsp;nicely&nbsp;made and very durable, as are the missile pods on either side of the helicopter which look great. I am not going to dock any points for a dull build though, as it is so short that I expected no more really.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When it is all finished, the helicopter looks good, better than I expected. The dark red and grey colour scheme really suits it and I like the features. There are four easily fired flick fire missiles (with silver warheads), movable flaps and rotating rotors, both on the top and at the back. The roof of the cockpit can also be removed for easy access to the pilot, who I think ought to be Deadpool as the chopper in in his colours. There are some controls inside and a nicely made little seat for him. The helicopter is open behind the pilot for a troop compartment and I love how it looks. Two Minifigures can sit in this compartment comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of grates slopes which add a bit of detail and two lights on the front of the helicopter. The three wheels on the bottom look alright although it would have been nice to see some kind of retractable landing gear. Deadpool's swords must be removed to allow him to sit inside and there are clips on either end of the side pods and they look fine when they are on there. The side pods can be adjusted too which is a nice little feature to have making it easier to aim the missiles. The motorbike for Wolverine is a great thing to be included and adds something for Wolverine to pursue his opponents on as he might struggle to keep up with a helicopter on his own steam, even if he is a Super Hero!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Basically, at this price point, it does not get much better than this. Between this set and Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape I would go for this one if you can only get one of them as the characters are all exclusive and perhaps a bit more interesting. However, I would certainly recommend both. For a licensed set, the price on this model is fantastic, really good value for money and it is great to finally see the X-Men making an appearance in the world of Lego, even if this is just one of them! Hopefully in the next year or two we will see a few more Super Heroes appearing in sets. Of course I can only give this&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;little set one rating...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I was under the impression Lego only had rights to the X-Men Comic Book characters and stories so this exact theme is most likley in the books as well.

<p><FONT size=3><FONT face=""Times New Roman""><B style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"">Magneto:</B> This is the real gem of this set IMO. He looks fantastic.

"Almaras","2012-05-23T04:18:08.233Z","Marvel-ous!","<p>Like all of the new Marvel Super Heroes sets, Wolverine's Chopper Showdown does not disappoint!</p>
<p>First of all: The Box. I love the bright colours and the comic style of the design, especially the sound effects - it really stands out.</p>
<p>The Minifigures. Magneto, Deadpool and Wolverine. In one set. Can you get ANY cooler?? The detailing is incredible. Upon opening the box I eagerly searched for the torsos, legs and claws and pieced them together. Highlights, for me, are: Deadpool and Wolverine's belt buckles, Magneto's helmet, Wolverine's hood hanging down his back and, of course, the adamantium claws!</p>
<p>The Build. My excitement grew as I was continually surprised while building Deadpool's helicopter. The small features such as the control screens in the cockpit (they are currently travelling at 82 miles(?) per hour), the ability to adjust the angle of the flick-fire missiles, the metallic silver peices (which I originally thought were a boring grey when I looked on the box), and just the overall density of the construction: I haven't built any other Lego aircraft before, so they may be consistantly good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't the flimsy structure I was expecting. It is solid and, although I don't want to test it, I would imagine that it wouldn't suffer too much from a crash landing. The propellor spins smoothly and steadily, it isn't jerky at all. </p>
<p>But my favourite part: Wolverine's Chopper. I absolutely love the design, it is the finest Lego motorcycle I have seen. The only frustrating flaw is that Wolverine can't hold both his claws and the handle's of the bike. I have currently settled for one hand on the accelorator and the other with claws extended, ready to dig into the ground for one of those tight turns seen in X-Men Origins :D</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall. This is a great set at a decent price! The finished build is packed full of playability, yet still stylish enough to complete any display. And with Magneto, Deadpool and Wolverine minifigures you really can't go wrong!!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-04T09:55:38.643Z","Not Really X-Men","<p><strong>Set #6866 Wolverine's Chopper Showdown:</strong> Cross-Marketed as an X-Men set, this is really more of a Wolverine vs. Magneto with Special Guest Deadpool set. There's no Professor X, no Cyclops, no Beast, no <strong>official</strong> members of the X-Men team except for Wolverine. So calling it an X-Man Themed Set would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>It's not a bad set in the long run, sadly it just doesn't have any other sets yet to interact with. LEGO has focused so much on picking and choosing who gets released in Marvel and there is such a back catalogue of characters to select from that you're going to run into the 'Can't Please Everybody' crowd.</p>
<p>On with the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>There's really nothing special or remarkable about the box. You see who's in the set, you get a picture of Wolverine on it, both in LEGO form and non-LEGO form, and you get to see what's included with the set. The back even has less to look at than most LEGO sets, as there are not as many features with this set.</p>
<p>The Instructions are going to be creased or mangled as there are no protective cardboard slips for this one. Folded in half is the least painful way to get the instructions, unless you're lucky enough to find a set where they were put in flush against the box which hopefully protected them.</p>
<p>They're fairly standard, as this set did not include Numbered Bags you follow each step one build at a time until you reach the finished model. It's all pretty standard, easy to follow without any tricky parts along the way.</p>
<p>Like all Super Heroes sets you also get a 'Comic Book' included. More like an animated promotional booklet of all the sets from 2012 LEGO produced, it's a thin extra booklet that also runs the risk of being creased, folded or horribly mangled. Overall though it does do a fairly good job of showcasing all the sets in typical LEGO fashion, on top of that it also serves as a decent LEGO Marvel Super Heroes Mini-Figure checklist and guide, since each comic showcases all the various Mini-Figures and which sets they come in.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I found this set to be pretty much full of great parts, many of them are standard bricks and things, but the color is what makes this set's pieces stand out. Since the helicopter build features a rich dark maroon color there are a lot of great pieces with that color in the set.</p>
<p>The pieces used in the construction of the rotor are equally useful for MOCers and since this set doesn't have any stickers on it you won't have any problems re-using them once building the main model is complete.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>A lot of AFOLS are going to fall in love with this set because of who is included, a lot of young fans of the franchise are going to enjoy it too.</p>
<p>First up, the crown jewel of the set is Deadpool, a crude character fans of the comics seem to fall over backwards to get in any form of action figure, this Mini-Figure captures the look of him quite nicely. He's got leg printing, mask printing and even a double-sided torso print for his costume. Using the Prince of Persia sword holder and swords in new darker coloring (first time in black if I'm not mistaken), this Mini-Figure stands out. He also includes a LEGO Space Alien Conquest blaster for a gun... Odd choice, but futuristic weaponry is not new for Marvel characters.</p>
<p>Magneto is pure brilliance, with his classic red and purple costume from the comics, LEGO even went so far as to mold a brand new helmet design for him. A 1x2 round plate in grey is used to some effect to represent a piece of metal Magneto is standing on while flying/levitating. He doesn't include any accessories, but he does have rare purple hands and a nice rich purple cape.</p>
<p>He is sparsely printed, with only double-sided printing on the torso for his costume. He also re-uses the same head as Gandalf the Gray (as both are Sir Ian McKellan in LEGO form) which means he has a double-sided head with neutral and angry expressions. (And really thick gray eyebrows which Magneto probably wouldn't have, still it works and saves on printing a totally new head to match the likeness of the actor for one minor detail.)</p>
<p>Wolverine is the main character of the set, he also has a double-sided torso and leg printing showing off the classic yellow and blue uniform from the 90s. Re-Using the hair piece first seen with LEGO Vampires he pretty much is un-masked Wolverine. (The back of his torso's print features part of his mask, showing that he's pulled it back over his head, which is a brilliant touch of detail.) He also has a double-sided face print with neutral and angry/feral expressions.</p>
<p>The new claw pieces used to mimic his trademark weapon are... Ok, they're just held in a Mini-Figures hands to look like he's unsheathed the claws for fighting, honestly in LEGO form they do work, however I think there might have been a better alternative. It's possible LEGO did go over all the other possibilities and this prooved to be the best option, personally I would have preferred something that could clip over the Mini-Figures wrists, similar to how the Handcuff pieces work, that way he could still hold the handlebars of his motorcycle while wielding his claws.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This big chunky looking military style helicopter is a great model to build, the steps are intuitive and fun. You get to see it come to life as you work on each section, the only nitpicky part is the propellor blades, as they are very loose until you secure them down up top with the large dish.</p>
<p>Other than that, unlike some vehicles, it won't fall apart in your hands as you're putting it together.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This is a great looking helicopter, a minor flaw is probably the open bay area where Mini-Figures can sit, other than that though this is a really unique looking helicopter. It is similar in nature to some of the LEGO City Helicopters we've seen in the past, I say similiar, however there are noticeable differences. Such as the choice in how it looks, it is pretty close to a standard looking military vehicle.</p>
<p>No retractable landing gear unfortunately, however that's a minor complaint and not that important in the grand scheme of things. There are a total of four flick-fire missiles, two on each weapons pod for play value. The rotor spins well and doesn't fall apart when you give it a really powerful spin. There are also two clips on the side that can hold Deadpool's swords so he can sit inside the cockpit and fly it without losing them.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'd have to say LEGO's choice in models for this set was pretty safe, it might have been better to get an official Blackbird, but Deadpool doesn't drive that X-Men vehicle and this is meant to be his personal vehicle I believe.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are great fun, it's just a shame that the only other X-Man made available by the LEGO group so far is the highly sought after and expensive Pheonix from SDCC 2012.</p>
<p>Still there is hope for 2014 to introduce more LEGO X-Men in retail sets, hopefully by the end of next year we'll at least have a DoFP based set due to the new film coming that year. It'd be nice to get a buildable Sentinel with more X-Men team members and perhaps Mystique and Sabretooth for the villains.</p>
<p>Strongly recommended over Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape as this set is priced decently and features unique Mini-Figures.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-02T17:09:14.547Z","Welcome...to DIE","Now here is one of those sets that seems more and more peculiar the longer you think about it; therefore, for maximum enjoyment, I recommend that you do not think about it at all and instead indulge in the three obvious reasons for buying this set: Wolverine, the super-popular mutant who is the best at what he does; Deadpool, the Merc With the Mouth and an odd but certainly welcome inclusion in this set, and Magneto, the Master of Magnet. All three Minifigs are suitably detailed and accurate, as one would expect from a licensed theme, although I can imagine that LEGO fans who do not share the same interest in comic books may find themselves puzzled as to who Deadpool is and what he's doing here. I can't answer the second question, but, as far as I know, Deadpool has been a fan favourite for a long time, and he looks great here.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>There are two builds here, though one could easily argue that Wolverine's chopper is far from being an actual ""build"". The motorcycle is inoffensive enough that it'll fit easily into a City display for anyone's use, which is just as well, since Wolverine can't exactly hold the handlebars when he's ""holding"" his Adamantium claw pieces. The main (only?) build here is, of course, the helicopter, which may or may not be the reason why you bought this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Which is not to say that the helicopter isn't a great piece of work. In fact, it's got a pretty slick design and may be among the most militaristic pieces of hardware that LEGO has released to date. I may be somewhat biased here because this is the first LEGO helicopter of any kind that I have owned, and I am not disappointed. The exterior has all the appropriate details that we've come to expect and love from contemporary vehicles, and this is augmented by a number of great moving parts, including propellers and enough flick-fire missiles to level a small town. Even better, the flick-fire missiles sit on an ""aimable"" rack that has some movement, so you can more accurately punish those who get in the way of the party that owns the helicopter, which, in fact, is the central mystery of this entire set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Does the helicopter belong to Magneto? That would be ridiculous, since the set itself includes a round ""metal"" plate that indicates that Magneto ought to be able to fly unassisted, so him having a helicopter would be pointless. That means that the helicopter is Deadpool's, but no real reason is given for him owning it, and Deadpool is usually not one to ally himself with Magneto, or anyone else, for that matter. All the same, Wolverine seems intent on tearing both of them to pieces for an unspecified reason.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then again, I suppose buying LEGO sets for the plot makes about as much sense as watching the <i>Transformers </i>movies for the plot, so perhaps we should just be content with an X-Men set sneaking its way through along with the Avengers sets. I'm sure that I'm not alone in hoping that other famous X-Men soon make their way into Minifig form (are my hopes for a <a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/James_Madrox_(Earth-616)"">Jamie Madrox</a> Minifig completely misplaced?), but, for now, you can be content with the three great Minifigs that come with this set. It's up to you how you decide to use your helicopter: you can have Deadpool fly it, as suggested, you can cannibalise it for dark-red parts, which this set includes a great variety of, or you can put some of your City criminals in it and terrorise the town, which is exactly what I did. After all, why should it be only the good guys <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7288-1"">who get all the sweet toys</a>?</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

<p>Parts: not a whole lot of unique parts besides Wolverine&#39;s claws and bike.</p>

<p>Minifigures: All three Minifigures are unique to this set the best one in My opinion being Deadpool. This version of Wolverine has his mask off unlike the other one which features brown highlights instead of blue. magneto is also different in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build is fairly straight foreword in that it&#39;s mostly brick on top of brick with&nbsp; some studs not on top (SNOT) throughout the Helicopter</p>

"sideswinger","2021-09-08T15:31:50.12Z","GREAT PRICE, and a surprisingly great BUILD!","<p>Sideswinger here, reviewing the 2012 LEGO Wolverine&#39;s Chopper Showdown. This set includes 199 pieces, and it retailed for only 20 dollars when it was released. Keep in mind, this is one of the most saught-after sets second-hand in the entire Marvel Super Heroes theme, so it&#39;s pretty pricey to get nowadays. Now&nbsp;let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures, and shockingly enough, all three are exclusive. I wanna talk about Deadpool first, which is a character that never appeared in any other sets, if you don&#39;t count the Deadpool Duck minifigure. I think Deadpool is the sole reason why this set is so sought after, given that he is such a popular character. I do love the design of him, with the printing on the head and&nbsp;torso; and the swords attached to his back are basically iconic, so it&#39;s great seeing that neck attachment piece used here. With that being said, even though Deadpool is the reason most people got this set, my personal favourite minifigure here is Magneto. Having watched all the X-Men films, Magneto has always been one of my favourite characters, and his iconic look is captured expertly in LEGO form. Again, he&#39;s another exclusive character, and the red and purple colour scheme looks fantastic. The helmet is an incredible piece, though I don&#39;t believe it was new to the set. The printing on his torso is also good. And lastly, Wolverine is included, who is yet another exclusive character. His hair piece is incredible, with that great widow&#39;s peak design reused from old LEGO vampire figures, and the printing on the face and torso are also pretty great. I do believe his claws were new for the set, and they make for some fine accessories.</p>

<p>Builds:</p>

<p>This set technically includes two builds: Deadpool&#39;s helicopter, and Wolverine&#39;s&nbsp;motorcycle. That bike was new to the set, and even though it&#39;s a pretty tiny build, the inclusion of it is fantastic. I think it makes for a good side-build, and I love the silver colour it&#39;s caste in. The main build of the set is Deadpool&#39;s chopper. Personally, I don&#39;t like LEGO helicopters solely because of how overused the trope is. Most &#39;copters in LEGO are boring, repetitive, and uninteresting, so I don&#39;t think the choice of including a chopper was a fantastic one. But shockingly enough, with that being said, I actually really love the build here. It looks different enough from most LEGO &#39;copters to appear fresh, and I also think the colours look&nbsp;splendid. But I&#39;ll go even farther to say that everything about the chopper is great, from the unconventional use of a windshield in front, to the weird tires at the bottom. I really love the slopes&nbsp;on the sides, I love the extra details on the top of the central propeller, the round slopes on the sides and top, and the missiles at the sides add great playability as well. And obviously, that chopper is massive for a 20 dollar set.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>The building process this offers is decent. The helicopter build-up is okay, but the finished model is more interesting than the actual building process is. I do like how the helicopter is substantial, so it will take a bit of time to build it, which is a great way to pass the time. But all in all, it&nbsp;isn&#39;t extremely enjoyable to build.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The play value of this set is fantastic, for many reasons. When I was young, I always loved playing with LEGO motorbike builds, so I can see how that bike can amp up the playability. And of course, that helicopter is extremely playable, and all those propellers spin, which honestly make&nbsp;for nice fidget spinners. I think the minifigures included are super playable as well, and overall, the play value of this set for 20 dollars is amazing.</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>Overall, for 20 bucks, the value this provides is amazing and excellent, the three exclusive figures are all amazing, the builds look awesome, and the playability this has is fantastic. Honestly, I don&#39;t have much else to say. This is just a fantastic set for the price, and for everything else as well! That is all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
