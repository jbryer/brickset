I was a bit sceptical about Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape as it does not look as striking as a set like 6869, Quinjet Aerial Battle, nor does it have as many exclusive Minifigures as many other sets (there is one in this model) but now I have it, I must say I was totally wrong about it!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very striking with a similar dark red colour scheme on the bordering along the top and sides of the box to all of the other Marvel sets. It is the same size as any other box at this price point and has the golden Lego Super Heroes logo which is nice to see and that charming image of the four Avengers in Lego form which I love. The&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;ages, set number and set name are displayed in yellow text on the main image which is action packed. Iron Man is pursuing Loki and Hawkeye who are escaping in the S.H.I.E.L.D. truck. The pursuit is taking place through a tunnel which has cleverly been put out of focus in the background to give the illusion of speed. In the bottom left hand corner of the cover there is a gallery of the three Minifigures included in the set and a reference to the comic included as well. The back of the box demonstrates the features on the truck and how the faceplate on Iron Man's helmet can lift up to reveal Tony Stark's face underneath.</p><p>The instructions were flawless with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces. The comic is nice with actually three separate strips, all are very nice but only one displays this set in action.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are quite a few useful parts in this set, including a whole heap of dark blue! This is great as it is not an easy colour to come by I find and could be useful for your own creations. There are plenty of slopes and four of those lovely big tyres, great for monster trucks and the like! However, the best parts for me are the two translucent round tiles which form the headlights for the vehicle. These are relatively new pieces and are exclusive to this set at the time of writing. They could be supremely useful and best of all an extra one comes with the model! It also features six of those new brackets which I think will be revolutionary in SNOT building so this is a great parts pack.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The three Minifigures are all great. But for me, one of them really stands out and that is Iron Man. But I will start with<b> Loki</b>, the villain of the upcoming movie and a superb character. He wears a huge ornate helmet which is pearl gold, it would be nice to see it in chrome gold but it looks good as it is. The piece is rubbery, mainly due to the long curling spikes which might snap off if they were made of a brittle plastic. There is a lot of little detailing on this piece including vents on the back and some sort of badge on the front just above his eyes which look out of the open front. The head is in fact identical to that of Bruce Wayne from set 6860, the Batcave. Personally I do not mind in the least as the head resembles his&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;in the upcoming Avengers movie and to me all that matters is accuracy. Besides, reusing the head will have saved Lego money which means they can spend that money developing other new prints and moulds!&nbsp;</p><p>The cape is green which has appeared a few times before but it looks super on Loki. The torso is dark grey printed with lots of alien markings, similar to those on the mysterious members of his army which appear in set 6865 and set 6869 and those markings are continued onto his legs. It is a shame to see no back printing on his torso but when it is covered by the cape it is of course not visible so it does not matter a jot, I just thought I would point it out. He holds the Cosmic Cube, which is just a 1x1 clear brick, and a golden staff made up of the same piece as appeared in set 7306 from the Pharaoh's Quest theme and nice little gold dagger which has appeared in a couple of Ninjago sets recently.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Hawkeye</b> is another lovely Minifigure. He has the same hair as Bruce Wayne and before that, Draco Malfoy from Harry Potter. I like this hair and I believe this is its first outing in this nougat colour making it exclusive I think. The head piece has double printing, one side has red goggles, the other has just a face with teeth bared with no goggles. His torso is highly detailed with dark grey strapping, lots of vents and buckles, and some nice black padding. There are some dark red highlights which look good and back printing showing a quiver for his arrows and more straps. His arms are bare so they are flesh coloured, but one hand is gloved in black which gives him a unique look. The legs are printed with two little straps and clips. He carries a brand new compound bow piece cast in black. I think it looks superb with plenty of detail and a nice arrow to boot.</p><p>Finally, we have the wonderful <b>Iron Man</b>. In this Mark VI armour he is exclusive to this set and I love it. The helmet is made up of two pieces, the main body of the helmet moulded in dark red, and the gold faceplate which can be lifted to see Tony Stark's face. The entire thing is covered with moulded detail and the eyes are printed white, accurate to both the Iron Man films already released and his look in the trailers released for the Avengers movie. I love the opening helmet function and it works really nicely. There has been a lot of debate over whether the helmet is too large or not, in my opinion it looks just fine, however, if you do not like it, you can try and buy either the preview Minifigure given away at Comic-Con, or find a good custom and purchase that.&nbsp;</p><p>The head piece is similar to that of Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner from Pirates of the Caribbean, but it is slightly different. It certainly resembles Tony Stark from the film, with his trademark moustache and beard. The torso is very detailed with plenty of armour panelling and the triangular ARC reactor. The most prominent colour of the piece is dark red like the rest of the figure, but there are gold highlights and of course the white power source. The back printing shows more panels and gold highlights. His legs are printed with gold thigh armour and knee pads. He also comes with some translucent blue studs and cylinders to create the repulsors and jets that he uses to fly. I like this touch but they are of course removable so it is your choice.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build took me about half an hour and was quite enjoyable. I like how the curved mudguards are attached and also how the bars on the front are formed using two different fence pieces. It is great to see doors which are usually omitted due to their effect on the structure of the vehicle, however on this model they are present and it is still very durable indeed.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When it is all together, the set looks fantastic. The dark blue truck is very striking and a bit different to most vehicles we see. I love the huge ground clearance and big tyres making the&nbsp;playability&nbsp;up there with the best. The stickers all really add to the look of the model but if you do not apply them, it still looks good. There are eight of them in the set so for sticker haters that could be a problem but not for me as I personally do not mind stickers.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few features in the set, two flick fire missiles which are easy to flick so they certainly add to the already fantastic playability. The roof can be removed to access the drivers seat which has control panels and dials, as well as a steering wheel and a lever. The blue chair does not look out of place and the two heroes (although it could be that Hawkeye is aiding Loki in this scene) fit in the cab easily, Loki cannot sit in there due to the huge horns protruding from his helmet. The final feature is found on the back of the vehicle, in the flat bed area you can pull a red piece to send Loki flying! There is a clip to hold the bow for Hawkeye and another which carries a red fire extinguisher. The back of the cab is made up by a window piece so anyone standing at the back can see the driver and on top of the cab there are some lights along with one of the stickers in the set.&nbsp;</p><p>The opening doors also have stickers on them, as does the step up to the cab and the mudguards at the back. The final sticker is found on the bonnet of the vehicle where there is a silver grill and some bullet holes. Beneath this piece there is space for an engine, but none is included so you can add you own is you wish.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I would certainly recommend this set, the entire model is faultless and I love the figures too. This is the cheapest way to get these three superb Minifigures and the value for money is not bad at all either with almost just the right price to piece ratio for a licensed set. So, without further ado I am obliged to give this brilliant set...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"VooDoo1011010","2012-04-08T19:14:11.493Z","A must have.","<p>Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape is a must have for anyone who likes Ironman or S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To top it off you get three fantastic Minifigures: first is Hawkeye, he has the same hair as Bruce Wayne (Fenrir, and Draco). I love his double sided head where he can either have shades or an angry expression. His torso depicts a sort of jump suit or armor and on the back is his quiver which is a nice touch. You also get a bow and arrow which is a new peice. His legs have printed detail, but nothing to run home about. Hawkeye also comes in set 6868, so hes not exclusive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next is my least favorite Loki who is styling the same head as Mr.Wayne (I have Bruce for refrence) which in my opinion is very lame of lego. He has a new helmet which is rubber not normal plastic, so that sucks. Although I don't like his head or helmet I do like his torso and legs which have cool printing. His Weapon is a staff made from the Pharoahs Quest staff and a weapon from Ninjago and the other weapon like object is the Cosmic Cube which is a powerful device&nbsp;that was seen in the&nbsp;Captain America Movie. Loki aslo has a green cape thet was used on Lockheart.Loki comes in two other sets 6868 and 6869.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the main attraction: Ironman(Mark 7). Ironman was the reason I bought this set in the first place and the reason the rest of you lego collectors will. He has a double sided head which depicts him with a smirk and an angry expression. His helmet is all new and its feature is fliping up to show Tony Stark's face. The torso is exclusive to this set as are the legs Since the other set&nbsp;has a different Ironman which is the&nbsp;Mark 6 suit&nbsp;(6869).</p>
<p>He also has cylinders for rocket jets and studs for blasters. Iron man also comes in set&nbsp;6869 (Mark 6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least is the Sheild truck it has 8 stickers and loads of dark blue peices. Its only features are blasting Loki off the truck (which doesn't work very well), Flick fire missles(of course), and seating&nbsp;a mind controlled Hawkeye in&nbsp;the front seat to do Loki's bidding. It can hold Hawkeye's&nbsp;bow on&nbsp;one side of the truck and on the other side it holds a fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I give this set&nbsp;a 8/10 for Loki being so lame. And thanks for&nbsp;reading!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,5

When I first saw the new Avengers sets, I found them to be generally ""meh"" when compared to the DC sets.&nbsp; This set was especially illustratice:&nbsp; cool minifigs with a generic truck (whereas DC sets seemed to have more unique vehicles).&nbsp; Seeing the Avengers movie made this set a bit more appealing--during the early chase scene in the movie, I distinctly thought to myself, ""hey, it's that Lego set!""&nbsp; Anyway, now that I have it in hand, I will say that it is much better in person.<br><br>The minifigs are still the main draw. In my opinion, Iron Man is the best (ironically, he is not in this scene in the movie).&nbsp; His torso (front and back) and leg printing is very sharp and detailed.&nbsp; I think the printing on this suit (the Mark VI) looks better than that of figure in the Quinjet set (the Mark VII).&nbsp; The two faces also really capture the personality of Robert Downey, Jr.'s Tony Stark.&nbsp; The helmet, however, is the most impressive piece---or, two pieces, as it is.&nbsp; Yes, it is a little big, but that was unavoidable.&nbsp; I would much prefer this helmet than with head underneath, than just a lego-head painted like the helmet with a stud on top.&nbsp; The translucent pieces representing the ""repulsors"" are a simple, but creative touch.<br><br>Loki is another top-knotch figure.&nbsp; His printing is nice and detailed, and the green cape really looks good.&nbsp; The rubbery helmet looks awesome, but doesn't fit quite as snugly as I would like.&nbsp; His spear is not movie accurate, but it is cool nonetheless.&nbsp; I do wish his cosmic cube was translucent blue rather than clear, but that is a minor quibble.&nbsp; <br><br>Hawkeye rounds out the minifigures. He comes off as a little bland compared to the more colorful characters,&nbsp; but he is a very nice representation of the movie's Hawkeye (who is also a little bland looking compared to the other characters). His printing is very detailed, especially his printed quiver. I can't help but wish he would have been given a classic quiver piece (in black) instead. His bow is new and unique, while still being reminiscent of the classic Lego bow. He has two faces, but the face with the shades is so much better than the bare-eyed angry face, I'm not sure if I'll ever use the latter!<br><br>Ok, onto the model itself.&nbsp; The final truck is very nice--it just feels good in your hands. It is robust and solid, with large wheels that roll very well.&nbsp; The colors are sharp and the stickers add some needed detail. The fire extinguisher and the speedometer are nice little details that Lego didn't need to add--but I'm glad they did.&nbsp; The gimmick in the back works well enough to make Loki look like he is being shot out of the truck.<br><br>There's nothing too unique about the build, but there are some nice pieces. The flat, 1x1 studs are an interesting new piece as are the new SNOT brackets others have mentioned--and it's always nice to have some big tires!<br><br>Overall, this is a very nice set which costs a fair price.&nbsp; The minifigures are must-haves (although the characters can be found in other, more expensive sets too) and the truck is a fun vehicle.&nbsp; I'm glad to own it. &nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-15T21:13:40.223Z","Redundant for Collectors, Great for Kids","<p><strong>Set #6867 Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape:</strong> Not every LEGO set is going to wow you, case in point a lot of the Marvel's Avengers Super Heroes sets have proven to be a tad dull compared to what DC got in 2012. Mostly due to the variety of Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>LEGO DC Super Heroes of 2012 may have had a fair number of Batmans cluttering up sets, however they also offered up a huge variety of villains and other characters. (Still wondering why Alfred hasn't been re-visited yet though.)</p>
<p>Marvel's Avengers failed to maintain that momentum, the Mini-Figures were repeated far too often in most cases and a lot of prominent characters from the film have yet to even see any form of release. (Agent Coulson I'm looking at you.)</p>
<p>However I do admit that the vehicle selection from Marvel's Avengers sets are pretty decent, not as iconic as some of the Bat-fleet of vehicles, but still up there as some fun vehicles to have on display and play with.</p>
<p>Still I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself, let's go into some brief detail on everything about this set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>This is one of two 24.99$ sets from 2012's Marvel line, and while Wolverine's Chopper Showdown is a great looking package, I find that this is the weakest of the 24.99$ sets that have been made available to date. And this is mostly due to who is included.</p>
<p>The box however is great, it's standard LEGO fair showcasing the features of the set and the names of the characters, the only real problem is that once again the instructions aren't protected and as this set also has a sticker sheet for detail work that can be a huge problem if the sheet is creased. Other than that I have no real issues with the overall design.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set really doesn't have much on offer in the case of unique parts, however what I really love in this set as useful parts are the two long hollow black rods, the monster sized tires and the new bow accessory for Hawkeye. Other than those few pieces I think you're looking at a lot of standard parts, although the shade of the blue is a bit darker than on most other sets, which does make them useful for MOC fans.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Mini-Figures in this set are great, really great, sadly they aren't unique, Loki comes in three sets as does Hawkeye and the only reason to buy this originally was the unique Mark 6 printing Iron Man. Which was made obsolete by the new Polybag released this year.</p>
<p>Loki is a nice looking figure though, and this is a much cheaper method of getting him than the Helicarrer or Quinjet sets, so that is nice. He has a single-sided torso print carried down onto his legs&nbsp;and a unique looking helmet piece made out of a softer rubbery plastic. His accessories include the staff found in Pharaoh's Quest and a Gold Sai combined to make his staff from the movie and a transparent 1x1 brick for the Cosmic Cube... I mean Tesseract.</p>
<p>Hawkeye is a great looking Mini-Figure with a double-sided torso print, a double-sided facial print (one wearing red tinted shades the other not and with gritted teeth expression) and printing on the legs. He also has one black glove and one flesh colored hand piece, which is unique amongst LEGO Mini-Figures as there are very few with mis-matched figure's hands. And his accessory is just great, a brand new bow in black (I believe representing a compound, or collapsible bow) which is just gorgeous.</p>
<p>Iron Man is in his Mark 6 Armor, and some of the earliest releases of this set had mistakenly packaged Mark 7 torso pieces. He's a great looking Figure despite no longer being unique and I love the sculpt work on his helmet.</p>
<p>I'm pretty dissapointed though that LEGO didn't choose to include the scientist that Loki also enthralled with his powers, as he was a pretty important character from the film plot wise.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I found myself really enjoying this build, it was fast and easy to follow along with and the vehilce itself is just pretty fun looking. It's not for everybody, but the build isn't an issue here.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Shield Truck looks pretty faithful to the on-screen counterpart. It does use a lot of stickers for detail work instead of printed bricks, which is kind of a dissapointment as some nice Shield logo printed pieces would work great for MOCers who'd prefer it over the stickers.</p>
<p>The play features are minimal and don't get in the way, it does feature flick-fire missiles. (Not really accurate to what happened on-screen.) It also has a flip-figure feature built into the back of the truck. Allowing you to throw Iron Man out or Loki if you prefer, it works pretty well. The front design of the grille and upper lights just look awesome as detail.</p>
<p>Honestly I think the Truck is the real reason to buy this set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is an ok set, a lot of older collectors interested in just the Mini-Figures might skip it without any real problems. I feel though that this is a great set for the younger fans who enjoy playing with their LEGO. The truck is a solid looking hefty vehicle, it looks great next to Fury's flying jeep thing from the Spider-Man set in 2013.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are honestly very good with a lot of excellent detail (I do kind of wish that Loki included an alternate hair piece though, either in this set or the Helicarrier Breakout one, it would have made him stand out better as unique and worth going after.), still in spite of some great detail work the choices for this set were a bit... Sameish. Two of them are in two other sets (Three in the case of Hawkeye counting the hard to find Polybag) and Iron-Man's status as the unique one worth going after changed once he was re-released in the polybag this year.</p>
<p>Still I do recommend this for younger fans. Collectors on the other hand is all a matter of opinion, do they really want/need three Loki? Actually yes, they might at that, as it would mean having multiple Loki to recreate the scenes in the film where he was in more than one place. Still it would have been nice to see some other important characters from the film as well.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3

"sideswinger","2021-11-04T19:22:59.123Z","WORST 2012 Avengers set?","<p>Sideswinger here, reviewing the LEGO 2012 Loki&#39;s Cosmic Cube Escape set. This includes 181 pieces, three minifigures, and retailed for 20 dollars when it was first released. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>This set includes three figures, none of which are exclusive. Hawkeye and Iron Man both came in their own separate 4 dollar polybags, so it wa fairly easy to get them back in 2012, which makes me wonder why they included them here. Loki, on the other hand, is vastly cheaper here than in the other 2012 set he was included in, the Avengers Quinjet set.&nbsp;I do like the Loki minifigure, but I&nbsp;have&nbsp;a few issues with him. First off, while I do love&nbsp;how the helmet was a new piece made for the character, I think it&#39;s just a tad too big and obnoxious. His face print is nothing special either, being reused from the Lex Luthor minifigure. Believe it or not, LEGO used that face up to 2020, which stinks, and I don&#39;t even think it fits the character at all. But aside from that, the torso detail on him is okay, and I do really love that staff accessory, which was a new piece to the figure, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Once again, none of the minifigures are exclusive, and like I said, this is not even the cheapest way to get those other two characters by a long shot, so I don&#39;t really like their inclusion here. But they don&#39;t look bad; I do like the printing all around the Iron Man minifigure, but once again, he isn&#39;t exclusive by a long shot, as he was included in two other 2012 Avengers sets. The Hawkeye minifigure is pretty cool as well, but gosh, he is incredibly inaccurate to his on-screen appearance. That widows peak hair does not match his hair in the film, though it was caste in a new colour for this character. His face also does not match. But the good thing is, his bow and arrow was new to the set, if I&#39;m not mistaking. Overall, I don&#39;t like the minifigure selection in this set, because none are exclusive, and none of them are very amazing either.</p>

<p>Builds:</p>

<p>The only build included here is that big S.H.E.I.L.D. truck, which believe it or not, is actually accurate to the 2012 Avengers film. Oversized LEGO trucks are pretty overdone nowadays, so this is far from the most exciting build out there. But with that being said, the design of this isn&#39;t bad. I do like the colour scheme of dark blue, light grey, and black. I also like all the stickers accessorised around the doors and the hood. Of course, I love that iconic red fire extinguisher clipped onto the side, and the brackets on top, which hold the 1x1 headlights,&nbsp;were introduced in this&nbsp;set. Aside from that, the overall look of the truck is not bad by any means, and I do quite like it. But with that being said, it&#39;s nothing that special or exciting.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>The building experience this provides is okay, but the truck is the same on both sides, resulting in a somewhat repetitive process. As a whole, if you&#39;re looking for a fun, enjoyable build, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The play value of this set is good, and I could see my younger s3lf having a blast battling those minifigures with each other. The truck itself, being as big and bulky as it is, is probably pretty fun o play around with, I would imagine, as it does roll very smoothly, and it&#39;s almost like playing with a monster truck.</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>Overall, this is far from my favourite LEGO Marvel Super Heroes set, for a few reasons. First off, none of the figures are exclusive, and two of which are super easy to get. Second, Loki and Hawkeye look incredibly inaccurate, so those minifigures aren&#39;t even very good. And third, the build really isn&#39;t anything to get worked up over. For twenty dollars, I think the value is okay, but I&#39;ll be honest: I&#39;m not a huge fan of the overall set. That is it for this review, thanks for reading.</p>
