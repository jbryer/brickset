I have found every one of them to be top notch and surprisingly good value for money given that they are licensed sets. When the names of the sets were first&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;before we got any images, set 6868, Hulk's Helicarrier Breakout, was the one that got me the most excited, now that I have it, I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed at all! The Minifigures are all fantastic and the set itself is very nice too so what more can you ask for? Here are my thoughts...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box design is lovely. The first thing you will notice about it is the enormous width, then the beautiful cover artwork. Like all of the other Marvel sets this box has the same dark red border that I am so fond of with the Super Heroes logo and the image of the Avengers in their Lego form in the corner. In the bottom right hand corner is the Avengers logo and in the opposite corner is the Minifigure gallery as well as an advert for the comic inside. The actual picture of the set displays the lab and prison area poised on some kind of precipice with open air beneath it, as though the action is going to take place in some kind of hangar bay area in the movie. The S.H.I.E.L.D. jet is flying up into what is&nbsp;presumably&nbsp;the inside of the&nbsp;Helicarrier, being piloted by Hawkeye (who as far as I can tell is just Loki's chauffeur in the film as he was driving him about in set 6867, Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape, although it is safe to assume he has been brainwashed by Loki from the comics in both sets). Hulk and Thor are attacking the dark blue jet, and Loki is standing in his cell while he awaits rescue. There are flick fire missiles and sparks flying all over the place as the action takes place which looks really excellent. As well as the sky and clouds at the bottom, the background shows a big, dark grey walled room with what look like containment pods all around and some nice structural framework.</p><p>The back of the box has a few images of the features in the set such as the flick fire missiles, exploding canopy, and exploding cell door. There is also a large central image of the set where the unfortunate Hawkeye has found himself in Hulk's iron grip. There is an image of the Avengers as they will appear in the movie at the bottom as well to complete the design.</p><p>The instructions have the same design as the box and I found no mistakes or missing pieces for me. The comic is in a separate booklet and is a nice thing to include, especially for younger children.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are plenty of useful parts in this set, including eleven small round tile pieces in translucent orange, these could come in very useful, and you get three extra ones as well as the build is split into numbered bags! There are plenty of plates and silver grills as well, including four dark grey octagonal pieces which I love and some nice translucent blue plates too. You get a few light grey pillar parts which are good to see and several handy slopes. There is a healthy pile of dark blue pieces for the jet and, best of all, two large translucent half-cylinders which form Loki's prison cell. These could be incredibly useful and would add a really unique architectural element to any building you create in the future. I have already ordered a couple from Bricklink, because I want to keep the set together, and I am putting them to good use in a MOC.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are four Minifigures included in this set and I like all of them. <b>Loki</b> is available in two other sets which despite the brilliance of the Minifigure, somehow reduces how much I like it. Nevertheless, he is a great figure with plenty of detail. His helmet is made of a rubbery material and is a dull gold. The huge horns look superb as does the huge amount of detail pasted all over the main bit of the helmet with vents and plating almost everywhere. This piece is packaged separately in a small bag of its own so it is obviously from China, however to me that is forgiveable so I am not going to dock any points for that. The head is the same as Bruce Wayne's from the Batman sets but this is fine as it serves its purpose nicely. Loki wears a green cape which is not seen very often so is a nice thing to have, and is accurate judging by what I have seen of the character in the various trailers released. The torso is very detailed with lots of small silver and gold shapes creating an interesting look, as well as a strap and some sort of collar. Sadly there is no back printing, but it is covered by the cape anyway. This printing is continued onto his legs but to a lesser extent. All of this is printed on dark grey which does not go terribly well with the green cape, however if it is accurate then I am happy! He carries a staff made from a piece seen in a Pharaoh's Quest set previously for the shaft, and a small dagger seen in several Ninjago sets recently which fits in a slot at the top of the shaft. It looks good to me and adds a bit of authority to the&nbsp;character.</p><p>The next is <b>Hawkeye</b>, who also appears in set 6867, Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape, and is a very nice Minifigure. His hair is in the nougat colour, exclusive to this figure, and it looks really fantastic, especially as I am a big fan of this mould. His head is double sided, one side with a pair of red tinted goggles which we see in the trailer, the other with no goggles and just a fairly plain, frustrated looking face. I like his eyebrows, which are the exact same colour as his hair, something which is not actually that common on figures, usually they are a&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;different shade. His torso is superb with lots and lots of detail. There is some nice padding which looks really textured, and some nice straps going all across the Minifigure. His back is printed with a quiver for his arrows and more padding and straps. I really like the red, black and grey colour scheme which runs throughout the figure. His arms are bare, but one of his hands is black as he wears a single glove which is a nice touch. His legs have a few&nbsp;buckles&nbsp;and more straps&nbsp;but&nbsp;are mostly plain black. He carries a lovely&nbsp;compound&nbsp;bow which is accurate to the film and a brand new mould. It has plenty of moulded detailing, including handle texture and some feathers on the arrow on the bow.</p><p><b>Thor</b> is also available in another set, 6869, Quinjet Aerial Battle. He is a lovely Minifigure with a huge amount of detail and he carries a brand new accessory as well. His hair is the same as Dastan's hair, first seen in the Prince of Persia sets, but this time in blonde. In this colour it is exclusive and it looks nice, albeit quite close to yellow, a similar colour to a banana really. His face is very well done with a double sided head, one side displays a straight and fairly neutral face with his dark blonde beard and big bushy eyebrows. The other side is very angry with bared teeth and the exact same beard and eyebrows. He wears a red cape which is nice, very regal looking! His torso has a lot of detail with the six large silver circles on his chest, and lots of strange armour which is all printed on a dark blue torso, there is also a brown belt around his waist. His back printing shows more armour plating and a continuation of the brown belt too. His arms are light grey with flesh hands and his legs are just plain dark blue. He carries a brand new moulded piece, his trademark hammer. It is plain light grey all over but the mould itself is quite detailed with just the right shape and a bit of texture as well.</p><p>My favourite figure from this set however, has got to be <b>the Incredible Hulk</b>. He is bright green which a few people have been unsure about, but to me it is alright, not entirely accurate but it makes him a bit more striking for sure. He is about twice the height of a standard Minifigure and as wide as he is tall. The character is made up of seven pieces, the main head, torso and legs piece, two arms, two hands, and two blue pins to hold the arms in place. He is poseable at the shoulders and the wrists, which gives him just about all of the movement he needs. His black shaggy hair is incorporated into the mould as are his huge muscles and ripped trousers. His head is printed with an extremely angry face and some wrinkles. The entire figure leans forward slightly to face the regular sized Minifigures which I like as it allows him to interact more easily with other figures for playability and display. His arms are moulded with lots of muscles and his hands have fingers cast into them. He can hold figures in his hand, as well as standard things which smaller Minifigures can hold, for instance, Loki's staff. His shorts are dark tan in colour and have some nice torn details, his feet have toes moulded and they do fit on Lego plates easily. Overall, I love this figure and since we have got a smaller scale polybag version of him coming up, I will be able to decide which one I prefer when that is released.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The construction phase was actually quite short. About forty minutes in total and was split into numbered bags, giving us more spare pieces at the end! There were a few interesting moments, I like the mechanism for blowing the cell open and the way in which the windows are made. The control panels are created in an interesting way for the control room above the prison with a medium&nbsp;length&nbsp;bar piece and some flaps with stickers on them, despite the strange design, they look outstanding!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The lab model is a little smaller than I imagined but is still a suitable size. There are four main features in the set, four flick fire missiles on the jet which are good for playing with the set, the exploding cell door which is&nbsp;created&nbsp;by using a rubber band and a slope piece basically to create a button to press in the control room between the two blue seats. There are also&nbsp;exploding&nbsp;oil barrels which are held in a rack which can be tipped over by&nbsp;pulling a section of the rack forwards. It is nice to see the classic Octan colours on the barrels and the feature does work quite well actually! My favourite feature though is the exploding canopy on the S.H.I.E.L.D. jet, presumably to recreate Hulk tearing it off to get at the pilot. It works really well by pushing down the yellow handle piece between the tail fins. All in all there is a lot of playability in this set!&nbsp;</p><p>On the left of the stationary piece is a small lab where we can see some kind of window and lots of computers and a white scanner. There are quite a few stickers in this area showing Loki's staff, which can be held over the scanner with clips. The right hand section is quite plain with just a window and an open area, as well as the rack for the oil barrels. The central area is where most of the action is though! The cell is very nicely detailed and the explosion feature really does work well. Any figure can stand comfortably in the cell as it is plenty tall enough, even for Loki's elaborate headgear! The control room above has two blue seats and lots of control panels (including one which shows Space Invaders being played, my favourite part of the entire set) and a window. The orange button for releasing the cell door is placed between the chairs nicely and fits in well. The jet is quite simple, but looks very sleek. It is mostly dark blue and yellow, similar to models from the Agents theme from a few years ago. The cockpit hinges open, as well as coming off totally for the exploding feature. The two angled tail fins look superb and the wings look great as well, somewhat reminiscent of a Eurofighter.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is another set from this theme I would recommend without a doubt. It is filled with fun features and the Minifigures are also superb. Hulk is of course exclusive and if you cannot get the entire set, I would advise you to find him on eBay or Bricklink as he is rally excellent, and you do not have all of the Avengers until you have him! I can find no faults with the set myself, so of course (once again) it has to be...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"captain_radda_radda","2012-04-16T00:42:57.603Z","HULK SMASH! My Wallet","After waiting what seemed like a lifetime for these darn Legos, they finally arrived at my local Target store. Ridiculously, though, only two were available. So I bought them gladly, but feeling incomplete considering that I wanted to buy the collection in one full sweep. This set was at the top of my list though do to the inclusion of Hawkeye and Thor, my two favorite Marvel figures. Anyway, without further to do, on to the review!<div><br></div><div>The Figs</div><div>So, to begin, I was&nbsp;flabbergasted&nbsp;by the figs of this set. Thor is by far my favorite. His armor is totally comic/movie accurate and the hammer Mjonir (I think that's how you spell it) is a great inclusion. However, the hammer is, sadly,&nbsp;monochromatic and seems to lack the detail that the figure itself has, as the hammer is not brown. Also, the hammer is gray, not silver, thus, The Thunder God's weapon feels like a blacksmith's tool rather than the bringer of storms. Of course, this is fixable with a splash of paint. The Hulk is awesome...but does not feel at all like a Lego. He is huge and&nbsp;disproportionate&nbsp;to the other Avengers&nbsp;and lacks any possibility. If anything, the only ""Lego"" thing about him is his rounded block head. I know I sound negative and contradictory considering I just praised the figs, but, let's be honest, the Jolly Green Giant has his flaws. On the positive side, Hulk has a great sense of detail and powerful&nbsp;presence&nbsp;to him that make the figure look and feel like the Hulk, yet at the sacrifice of not looking and not feeling like a Lego. Hawkeye is amazing. He is excellently detailed and has a quiver on his back. His bow is new and looks true to the film. Also, the goggles he has are well detailed and I believe the color of the hairpiece is new. Hawkeye looks true to the movie form, yet also adheres to the Ultimate form from the comic. And then, there was Loki. Loki is, without a doubt, one of the best minifigures I have ever seen. His crown is truly awesome and has all of the ridges and curves to make it look all the more deadly. Loki's armor is completely movie accurate and his staff is phenomenal. Loki's cape and facial expression are also spot on. Truly, Loki is an accomplishment for TLG and a golden&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;for any MOCer anywhere.&nbsp;</div><div>Loki: 5/5</div><div>Hulk: 3.5/5</div><div>Thor: 4.5/5</div><div>Hawkeye: 4.75/5</div><div><br></div><div>The Set</div><div>Since most of you are buying this set mainly for the figs, I won't go into tremendous detail. The&nbsp;actual&nbsp;lab itself is well detailed and interesting...even though I have no idea what's supposed to be going on. The holding cell for Loki is nice, big, and compact. The top computer is&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;and the staff holder&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;bay is a cool feature thanks to the addition of the computer. Also, the, uh window I think, is roomy and allows for a nice area for the Avengers to, forgive me for this, ASSEMBLE! The features work as they should and the lab is a good playset. Be warned, though, it is small and VERY underwhelming thanks to its size and huge reliance on stickers. The jet is really the star of the actual set though. It is a nice tint of blue and looks like something from either Lego Agents or classic Alpha Team. Honestly, it is really cool looking and is sleek and swooshable. However, the jet's biggest flaw is the bubble windshield, which could have been replaced by the traditional sloping semi-triangular windshield. Nevertheless, it is a cool little play feature and would have been a great set on its own.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall</div><div>This set is very cool, but very reliant on gimmicks and minifigures to sell itself. The price is about $10 over what is relatively fair and the size is pathetic for a $50 set. However, the minifigures indeed make up for it. Although the set is very interesting, i'd focus on the other sets first and pick this up ONLY if you're a hardcore Hulk fan. Either way, I do recommend it to any Marvel fan...just try to get it on sale.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"sayapone","2012-07-20T11:37:04.477Z","Excellent playability","Ordered 6867 from a friend but I got this set instead - which turns out to be a blessing in disguise:) Since watching the movie my son has been a big fan of Hawkeye and this is just the perfect set for a fan like him.<br><br>It came in three packets and each one was an excellent build! I made my son open 1 packet each day and it did not kill the thrill! You can choose whichever packet to open and each would have its own playability. Choose packet 1 for Hawkeye, packet 2 for Loki or packet 3 for Thor. Hulk comes in its individual packet so you could play ""Hulk Smash"" with any figure if you choose to open them differently. <br><br>The stands/bases could be rearranged as we see fit; just like a modular building. Awesome playability!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-19T16:39:08.833Z","Hulk's breakout set.","<p>For any fan of <em>The Avengers</em> or Marvel Comics in general, there is pretty much just one reason to pick up this set, and that reason is the jolly green giant after whom this set takes its name: the Incredible Hulk. This imposing and impressive ""Macrofigure"" is a must-have for any devout follower of the Marvel superheroes line, and if you need any confirmation that LEGO's interpretation of the Hulk works, then I will give you a one word summary: yes. The Hulk is awesome. He matches up in size and scale to various <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas364"">giant trolls</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4950-1"">Rock Monsters</a> that have terrorised the LEGO universe over the years, and you are unlikely to be disappointed by him. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the rest of set...well, in my opinion, there's a lot left to be desired. Unlike the superior Quinjet (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6869-1"">6869</a>), which succeeds in form as well as function, there is very little ""form"" to be had from the Helicarrier Breakout - which seems strictly interpretative, if anything&nbsp;- although there is quite a bit of function to it. In short, this set was clearly designed to be an action setpiece more than anything else, and while this may prove to be a lot of fun for preteen boys, it leaves the AFOL a bit sadly out of the loop this time. I guess that's what we get for spending all our grown-up money on toys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other than the Hulk, there are three Minifigs in this set: the mighty Thor, his villainous half-brother Loki, and the always-cool Hawkeye. Sadly, none of these are exclusive to this set, with Thor and Loki being available in the aforementioned Quinjet Aerial Battle and Hawkeye also hailing from Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6867-1"">6867</a>). If you have either of these sets, you'll already have these Minifigs, as their appearances are exactly identical. It's a pity that there aren't any generic SHIELD agent Minifigs, though Minifigs from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/browse/?Theme=Agents"">Agents</a> line actually&nbsp;work pretty well, since they're&nbsp;fortuitously wearing the dark blue SHIELD colour. Considering that there's a lot of space available in this set, it might be worth an investment. I've discussed most of the Minifigs before in my <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/?ID=43749"">Quinjet review</a>, so I won't repeat my opinions on Loki and Thor here. Instead, I'll just talk briefly about Hawkeye and the Hulk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hawkeye happens to be a personal favourite character of mine, so I was very much anticipating his Minifig incarnation. He did not disappoint: his torso and legs are incredibly accurate and detailed, and his double-printed head gives the discerning fanboy two choices: either a more movie-style face without the goggles, or a more ""<a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/Category:Clint_Barton_(Earth-1610)/Images"">Ultimate</a>"" look with the red goggles on, which I prefer. His compound bow is also very cool, although, very strangely, he does not have a quiver, which means he is firing invisible arrows out of nothingness. As for the Hulk, owing to his highly-specialised nature, he comes from Chinese-made parts, though I noticed no discernible difference in quality. While comic book purists (aka nerds) might take umbrage with his size with respect to the other Minifigs, I think it's appropriate. The physical detail on him is excellent, and I have absolutely no complaints. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As far as I can interpret, the set itself combines two pivotal scenes from the 2012 film: in which the Avengers are gathered and find themselves influenced by the chaotic nature of Loki's staff (which they have taken from him) and the scene in which Loki and Black Widow are trading a battle of wits (which was really not all that witty). This action setpiece contains a number of interactive bits: a ""holder"" for Loki's staff, a bunch of high-tech doodads that ostensibly control the glass chamber mechanism (as well as a game of <em>Galaga</em>), and a, um, thingy to the side that launches a bunch of barrels/oil drums to either aid or hinder Loki's getaway, depending on your preferences. The octogon on the right is completely empty and therefore up&nbsp;to your interpretation. The glass panels also break&nbsp;apart and replace easily for fans of Hulk smashing. All of the interactive parts work well, but there's little&nbsp;thematic or aesthetic coherence to any of it, which is a shame, but I guess it's inevitable considering that this is a set&nbsp;based on a tentpole media franchise and not exactly a modular build or anything like that. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The secondary build is a small SHIELD&nbsp;jet, and it really is quite rudimentary, bringing&nbsp;back memories of Classic Space vehicles, and not exactly in a good way. It has a little gimmick where the cockpit cover pops out and a couple of flick-fire missiles, but, honestly, the jet is more to buff up the piece count more than anything else. It's not hideous, but LEGO has certainly made better aircraft in its time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So is this set worth the US$50 or its equivalent just for the Hulk, and possibly Hawkeye? That pretty much depends on your affinity for the Marvel universe as a whole, whether that be the cinematic or comic book one. It's nice to have a ""base"" for the Avengers Minifigs, and this is as close as you can get among the first wave of Marvel sets. If nothing else, it provides a lot of interesting parts in which you might be able to create a more aesthetically pleasing base for your superheroes with a little bit of creativity. The bottom line is that Hulk is awesome, and if that alone sells it for you, then go for it. Otherwise, if you're perhaps looking for a gift for an action-loving preteen, this will do the job as well. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,2

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-17T20:39:12.1Z","Hulk SMASH","<p><strong>Set #6868 Hulk's Helicarrier Breakout: </strong>Interrupting the number sequence of the 2013 sets because this is my 550th review, so I wanted to do a set that had a bit of a meatier value to it compared to 76009. Don't worry I'll finish that off too.</p>
<p>This is the second larges set from 2012 Marvel Super Heroes and is a bit of a dissapointment where the Mini-Figures are concerned, the build however tends to make up a bit for this. Even if it does feature sticker details in abundance.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box for this set is quite large and it shows the set in action, mimicing the scene found in the film. The back shows off the play features quite nicely and you get to see all the Mini-Figures in the set on the lower right hand side.</p>
<p>The instruction manual is a larger one, with no cardboard, it's suitably thick and shows the build instructions in typical LEGO fashion. The comic in this set is huge, it's the size of a real comic book unfortunately it isn't as thick. It does however show off all the 2012 sets and which ones you can find certain Mini-Figures in. I liked the design of this earlier book a bit better than the others, they showed off the set in a fun LEGO short story and each one was unique.</p>
<p>The problem with the newer sets is that they include the exact same comic in every box, not as unique.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this set are pretty standard nothing jumps out at me as rare or anything like that. For 389 pieces this is a pretty decently priced set, for a licensed set that is. I would however recommend picking it up on sale if possible, the parts in the set are good for MOCing though since there are quite a few large hexagon plates and those do tend to be useful.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Here's where this set really falls a bit flat, mostly because aside from one particular character sized figure this set has no unique characters. There are 4 Mini-Figures in the set and of the 4 three are found in multiple sets and there is only one that (until later this year) isn't found anywhere else.</p>
<p>Thor: Thor is the same as the one in Quinjet Aerial Battle and the Thor and Cosmic Cube polybag set. I don't really have much else to say about this figure that I haven't covered before, he's got the same great print and mighty mjolnir accessory, and that awesome red cape is always fun. Unfortunately he isn't unique or anything.</p>
<p>Hawkeye: Again nothing rare here, he's in at least two other sets including a Polybag. I reviewed him a bit more in-depth when I reviewed Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape, he's got a great looking print and I do dig the new bow accessory for him. It's just a shame he isn't rare or anything... Although I suppose that's a bit of a good thing as it means you can find him in cheaper sets.</p>
<p>Loki: Now what I really hate about this set is that he's wearing his big hat, in this scene from the film he mostly didn't have his hat on and so you could&nbsp;see his hair. As I may have mentioned when I reviewed the Cosmic Cube Escape set, while I enjoy the look of the figure it would have been nice if he included a secondary hair piece so you could have him mimic the scenes where he's not wearing his big helmet piece. An interesting thing to note, while the set features only one fully complete staff you do get a spare golden staff piece without the extra add-on piece to make the full staff.</p>
<p>The Hulk: This figure is pure awesome, he's a big hulking brute and stands at least close to two Mini-Figs high if I'm not mistaken. The funnest aspect is that you can have him hold regular Mini-Figures in his hands so you can have him re-enact the famous scene from the film during the Stark Tower fight. The sculpt on this guy and the sheer size of him just works, I really like that he's smaller than the Cave Troll from LotR because then you can have a truly epic battle between him and said Cave Troll. He's not wearing the purple trunks Hulk is famous for, but the new Hulk's Lab Smash set will correct that particular issue. I think the only flaw in his sculpt work is the fact that he can't turn his head, the Troll in Harry Potter was a single sculpted piece that could at least turn his head, perhaps it would have cost too much. It would have been appreciated though.</p>
<p>I'd have to say this is a weak set as far as Mini-Figures are concerned, especially for 65$ full price, it would have been nicer to at least see Agent Coulson, he's a key character in the movies (and SHIELD television show) and not having him in Mini-Figure form yet really feels like a missed opportunity.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set features three numbered bags, bag 1 builds a small SHIELD aircraft, bag's 2 and 3 build the 'Lab' with containment area for Loki. It's a bit of an open area build, you aren't making an actual structure, more of a section of the interior of the Helicarrier, hence the name of the set. It's a satisfying build though, the small aircraft is a fun little side-build and the 'Lab' may have a bit of repetition in the steps, it is by no means boring to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The SHIELD aircraft is a nice dark blue coloured craft, it's a small fighter jet style vehicle with four flick-fire missiles for a play feature and again, stickers for the SHIELD logo. It's fun to swoosh around the room and doesn't take up too much space on display, it's a great support craft for the Quinjet too should you own both.</p>
<p>The Lab model is modular, it builds the main containment area from the film to hold Loki (which is a bit on the small side compared to what we actually saw on screen), it also includes the control section from the main bridge which isn't actually part of this set. There are two side-builds that hold things together when you attach the other sections. One side is where you put Loki's staff for scanning, with stickers to show off the scan being made, the other has some windows and a couple of fuel tanks or something that flip over when you push a lever. (A fun little side feature for play.)</p>
<p>There are more holographic display panels and the control section features a fun little comedic nod to Stark's comment about Space Invaders. That's right, one of the control panel stickers shows a screen shot from Space Invaders the classic arcade game. This is just too funny and I love it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this is an ok set, if you aren't collecting the entire line, because this would be the only way to get Hawkeye if you skipped the Cosmic Cube Escape. This is the only way to get Hulk (or at least it was until this year's set reveals). Honestly I think LEGO could have done a better job on the Lab, case in point the newer set has a much more impressive looking build.</p>
<p>Still this set builds the features seen in the film. It would have been nice to have Bruce Banner or Phil Coulson in the Mini-Figures. (Banner hasn't been around yet either as far as Mini-Figs go.) It's a fairly decent set for this price range, especially if you can get it on sale and the small SHIELD jet thing is just all kinds of fun. If you're looking to have all Avengers sets you're going to want this set. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

"sideswinger","2021-11-04T19:37:45.22Z","Decent build, but BAD minifigures!","<p>Sideswinger here, reviewing the LEGO Hulk&#39;s Helicarrier Breakout set. This was released back in 2012 to coincide with the Avengers film, and it includes 389 pieces. It retailed for $49.99 back in the day, but it goes for about $78 sealed nowadays. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>This set includes four figures overall, one of which is a big-figure, as people call it. I wanna talk about the actual minifigures first, though. None of the three minifigures are exclusive, which stinks, considering the retail price of this set was 50 dollars. I have a whole truckload of issues with the minifigures, but we&#39;ll discuss that in a bit;&nbsp;I wanna talk about them individually first. Thor looks decent, and is perhaps the most accurate character in the entire set. I think the hair piece they use fits the figure fairly well, and this set introduced that new Mjolnir piece, which I really appreciate. I also like the face print, and the cape is a good inclusion. However, this version of Thor was included in the Quinjet of the same year, and it was even included in a 4 dollar polybag...which makes the inclusion of the figure in this set a bad one. That same problem of minifigures being in cheaper sets carries on to the other 2 characters: Loki comes in two other sets, the Quinjet, and the 20 dollar Loki&#39;s Cosmic Cube Escape set, and stinkin&#39; Hawkeye comes in that same 20 dollar set, and also a 4 dollar polybag! That makes all three minifigures extremely undesirable, and it was just an absolutely terrible choice to include these three characters with such an expensive set. Plus, Hawkeye and Loki aren&#39;t even good figures, as they both look incredibly inaccurate. Now I know LEGO wanted to sell this set on Hulk alone, but that isn&#39;t a good excuse to give three awful minifigures! Anyways, you may be thinking the Hulk big-fig will save the minifigure selection here, but TBH, Hulk doesn&#39;t really cut it for me. I am impressed that LEGO created a new mould, and this Hulk figure was the first modern big-fig ever! But if you&#39;re gonna make a new mould, the least you could do was make it accurate. The colour of Hulk&#39;s pants, and also the style of his hair are both innacurate. At the end of the day, Hulk isn&#39;t as bad as the other characters, and I do really like his facial expression, but all in all, the minifigure selection for this set is just plain awful.</p>

<p>Builds:</p>

<p>This set covers 2 builds: the small jet, and the facade for the helicarrier. I wanna start with that jet, which isn&#39;t even accurate to the movie. A S.H.I.E.L.D. jet was in the film, but it didn&#39;t look anything like&nbsp;his one. I do like the colour scheme of this, with the dark blue, dark grey, and yellow. However, the design of it is pretty terrible, in my opinion. I don&#39;t like how thin the cockpit section is, nor how boring&nbsp;the wing part looks. It really is a bad build all in all. However, even though I&#39;ve been extremely negative thus far,&nbsp;the Helicarrier facade build is okay. I wanna start from left to right, and the first platform consists of what looks to be a&nbsp;small white chair, some large trans-blue panels, and a small section to wield Loki&#39;s sceptre. Even though the &quot;chair&quot; or whatever it is, is pretty random, it doesn&#39;t look too bad, and I love the blue pieces behind it, as it adds a futuristic sense to the scene. The inclusion and placement of the sceptre is great as well. Moving to the right, I really love the 2x2 tiles clipped onto that pole, as they include some fantastic&nbsp;stickers. Next is what might be my favourite part of the set:&nbsp;that cell for Loki. I really love the pod design, with the transparent corner curved panels. Of course, a play feature is incorporated with it; if you push on that 1x1 tile on top of the cell, the panel in&nbsp;front flies off! I really love that play feature, even though it isn&#39;t as epic as some play aspects in other Marvel sets. On top of the cell, we have a small seating area, and I like the stickered pieces, although&nbsp;there really isn&#39;t that much happening up there. Moving on to the right section of the build, we have a small play feature, which allows those canisters to fly off those tiles; it&#39;s small, but effective. And lastly, we have that big ol&#39; plate with no detail, aside from the blue panels at the back. I understand that this was meant to be a display plate for Hulk, but I really wish some sort of extra detail would have been incorporated on it.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>So the building experience for this set really isn&#39;t all too grand; there aren&#39;t really any interesting building processes, and it uses some bland part usage, so I can&#39;t really recommend this, if you&#39;re wanting a building experience.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The playability this set has is not too bad, and it may actually be good, as it includes some a few characters to mess around with. I do wish it included more minifigures for play value, but the jet, the cell, and hulk are all features I would have really enjoyed as a kid, so I am kind of pleased with the playability this has.</p>

<p>Final Verdict:</p>

<p>So I know I&#39;ve been pretty negative throughout this review, and it may seem like I hate the set. Well, I don&#39;t hate the set, but I do hate certain aspects of it, like the minifigures, and the jet. The main Helicarrier build could be better, but for 2012, it isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world. This still isn&#39;t my favourite 2012 Avengers set, but for what it is, it&#39;s not awful. And the price tag of $49.99 is kind of steep, but Hulk really bumps up the price, so I won&#39;t complain too much. All in all, this set is alright, but I wouldn&#39;t typically recommend it. That&#39;s all for this review, so thank you for reading!</p>
