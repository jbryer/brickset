"Niallskie","2011-12-17T22:38:07.297Z","Minifigures is the bomb, errrr Kryptonite?","<p>Was expecting this set to come Jan 2012, but have been seing this at some local sellers here in Oregon. On a whim I dropped by a Fred Meyer and saw this set was available already along with other DC Universe Lego set. I'm very happy to get these sets without mark ups like other big store do, so score!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review, I'm sure that when I say the highlight of these sets are the minifigures... and they do live up to the hype! Superman is awesome, would have been better if the cape have the Superman logo as it should be. Wonder Woman is fantastic, just not the biggest fan of the magic laso. It looks like a giant baloon blower. Lex Luthor is Lex Luthor, just plain minifigure with a suit and that's about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mecha is cooler than it looked in all the pics on the net, even the box pic doesn't give it justice to the actual Mecha&nbsp;in my opinion. The build was simple specially for some exoforce collectors, maybe a good 15 minute. I love that they stayed true to the color scheme of Luthors armor in the comics, a mix of Barney and Gumby :D:D:D. The Mecha does look massive, but not too big for a fair battle with Superman and Wonder Woman. I do like the florecent green (dont know what they are called) it gives&nbsp;emphasize's on the Kryptonite which we all know is Supermans weakness. Would have been better if the Mecha has a knee that bends for extra pausability. I love the back pack, gives more detail to the Mecha, would have been nice if the back of the legs would have been treated the same way for more details, but i guess that means more bricks, means&nbsp;higher price. I appreciate that they did not go for the usual black hose and&nbsp;went for a hazy clear hose&nbsp;which you can see the kryptonite juice flowing to the gun. Gun looks deadly, its great they put a gun handle on it even though the gun was held by a red peg on the arm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extra comics is a great addition, even the size of the instruction is perfect. I just dont know why they did not continue putting backing board and plastic for the instructions. My instruction and comics got bent. Other than that this set is a must have, and for the price you can even stock an unopened one :D</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"The_Reviewer","2012-01-08T11:22:06.923Z","The Man of steel...now in lego Form","<p>&nbsp;Thanks to my VIP card I got this for only 8 bucks. This is one of the new Superheroes sets of 2012 that lego has produced. And&nbsp;it comes with a Comic book (the Characters don't say anything though).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is the standard blue and yellow Superheroes Box theme.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are lots of intresting parts, there are a few rare purple pieces, the cabel that attaches to Lex luthor's fighting machine that is comonly seen in the Heroe-Factory line.&nbsp; and some neon elements.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigs are the real gold in this set. We get the one and only Superman who has a doube sided head. one wiht a normal serious experssion, the other; grinning (like he's trying to focus) He also has a red cape and a torso printing of his ""S"" emblem.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also get Wonder Woman, she has her red uniform printed, has a double sided head (one with a happy expression, the other; Angry like she's frusterated) and her laso of Truth is included. Last but not least we have Martin Lex Luthor with his bald head and business suit with a tie printed on. his head has a evil smirk on it.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build has some repetative steps (like when building the legs) wich can get annoying. But the whole thing only take 20 minutes at the most.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Vehicle is a little more colorful than you realize, but it does feel kinda small and I wish the legs had a extra joint to make it taller and you would have more movable legs.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a great set and I can't wait to get more from the Superheroes Line. I rate this 3/5. If you really like Superman then this is a must buy. -Thanks for reading.&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S Please check out my other reviews and Bricklists.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
"_add_um","2012-01-23T14:38:16.443Z","A really great set all in all. ","<p>A very nice set by Lego and by far one their best in a while.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Pretty simple design of the box. Its worth noting this is the only Super Heroes set that does not feature Batman nor the Batman Symbol on the box. Instead we're treated with Superman and the Superman Emblem, this means this is the only non-Batman set of the Super Heroes sets so far. Which is a shame, Superman has a rich history of&nbsp;Villains&nbsp;etc that could have been&nbsp;featured in other sets...however maybe the next few waves will bring them in. Anyway the box has an overall blue colour..the back of the box obviously show the model in action. I like the way the images are in comic book-like panels which is a nice touch. The side of the box also has pictures of Batman, Superman and The joker (not sure why but I'm not complaining). The instructions are what you expect and to be honest the comic included is meh.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Some very parts are included in this set; a lasso (of truth), a dark green crystal (used as kryptonite),&nbsp;plenty&nbsp;of trans green parts. Overall the pieces included are very nice. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>What isn't bad about these minifigures? ..one bad thing but it's very minor (very). In the set we are treated to three figures...i have to give props to Lego for including Wonder Woman in the set, they could have&nbsp;easily just included Superman and Lex, thankfully for collectors they throw her in too. Superman is by far the highlight of the set. I have been looking for him ever since the Batman sets got released back 2006, and&nbsp;finally&nbsp;Lego have now gotten the rights the entire DC Universe. I've noticed Lego have gone efforts now to include more detail on the recently released minifigures&nbsp;particularly on printing the back. All minifigures in this set have back printing, even Wonder Woman and Superman get an alternate faces, all which just make this set overall a must have. Superman is great, I'm love the new hair piece made. He also&nbsp;receives&nbsp;the grinning face and a serious face, both look brilliant. The second minifigure is Lex Luthor. He wears a black suit and Lego even give him a back printing, it seems&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;but Lego have gone out of their way these days in terms of detail. Since the character is bald he only gets one face. Wonder Woman like the other two looks awesome. The hair piece is really detailed as well as the torso. She gets two faces (one smiling, the other angry). The lasso of truth was also a very nice inclusion by Lego. My complaint however lies with the WW minifigure...despite the great amounts of detail on the legs (even the side of legs are printed!) Lego use the lower quality plastic (aka&nbsp;Chinese plastic)&nbsp;for them. It&nbsp;noticeable too since the rest of WW is made from the high quality plastic, it's a real disapointment but it's also only a minor factor. Overall Lego indeed have out done them selves with this set...just minifigures alone.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model&nbsp;</h4><div>The model consists of Luthor's Power-Armor/Robot. I really like this model. Lego have made solid model. The arms and legs of the robot have lots mobility, great for playability purposes and if you want to pose the model. I love how the minifigures can be held in the arms of robot. The green colour works very well in giving it that comic book feel. Lex fits nicely into the pod too. The gun is great, I really like the way its designed to have the kryptonite inside.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall Lego made a brilliant model and I highly recommend it to any fan.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2012-01-17T14:13:14.353Z","Superman Vs Power Armor Lex","<p>I ordered this through LEGO.com and due to back orders, got it just a few days ago. Of all the new DC Superhero sets out, this set is very unique and doesn't feel like a rehash and revisit to the older Batman sets.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly standard, cardboard and easy to recycle for those so inclined or in areas where there is recycling.</p><p>The instructions are in booklet format with step-by-step clear and easy to follow illustrations. <br></p><p>Included too in this set is a minicomic with an advertisement for the new LEGO Batman 2 video game expected to come later in the year.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's 207 pieces to this set, making it feel that the $19.99 for this set is well worth it. There aren't too many extra pieces as found in other sets, but I'm not too worried.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are three minifigures in this set, all of whom are unique and found only in this set and all hotly anticipated. Superman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor. My only minior complaint is with Wonder Woman's legs, the paint/print job seen on the front doesn't carry around to the back where it's a red color from behind. But maybe it wasn't expected given the target audience is children who'll be playing with the figures and prints on minis do wear out over time given enough play.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>I've only a few Mechs and Power Armors. Lex's Mech is the first one I've seen where the main body is built so that the waist can rotate. There's also some fairly unique pieces for the design of the pilot seat. I thought the upper arms were just a bit too short. Though after showing this build to some friends, they all felt that the Mech does justice in terms of build and colors to what's found in the comics.</p><p>A minor complaint though is the transparent green pieces that are part of the power system don't sit firmly inside and rattle and can fall out if it weren't for the clear dome pieces to keep them from getting lost.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Despite what are in the end just minor complaints or thoughts, this Power Armor set is a very welcomed addition to my collection and an awesome kick off to getting the rest of the 2012 Superheroes theme. For those who are Superhero fans, the set is well worth it and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to get. Which will be perfect for the younger collectors wanting to get in on this theme.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-01-23T20:27:13.517Z","Robot monster.","Now look: being almost exclusively a Marvel Comics reader, I know relatively little about the expansive DC multiverse, but I do know that Wonder Woman has come a long way from her horribly sexist and bondage-driven origins, evolving far beyond her laughably bizarre weakness of <a href=""http://www.cracked.com/article_19434_the-6-most-ridiculous-superhero-weaknesses.html"">losing all of her superpowers when her hands were tied by a man</a>. Given that modern-day Wonder Woman has the strength, power, and mythology that rivals Superman's, why are we being sold a set in which it is explicitly advertised that she has been rendered helpless by Lex Luthor's Power Armor robot, as cool as it may be? As a matter of fact, given that Luthor's ray gun thing seems to be powered by Kryptonite, shouldn't it be the case that Wonder Woman ought to be the one giving Superman a hand here and not the other way around? Everyone's getting their underoos all in a twist over <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Friends"">Friends</a> when we've got storylines like this sitting right on the shelves.<div><br></div><div>But, that's enough of that. The first wave of the ""DC universe"" LEGO sets are populated almost entirely by Batman setpieces, and for good reason, since Batman is by far the most&nbsp;salable&nbsp;of all of DC's superheroes. And I suppose I like Batman as much as the next guy, but there's something about him being translated into LEGO that never really sat well with me, and I end up liking the villain Minifigs much more than Batman himself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Superman, on the other hand, looks really nice as a Minifig, as does Wonder Woman, although you can probably tell by now that I am slightly annoyed that Batman and his friends get fifty sets while two equally iconic DC heroes have to share one. But no matter: both of these heroic Minifigs have a ton of detail to them, except for the annoying fact that the back of Wonder Woman's legs are printed solid red (something that LEGO claims is unavoidable due to their production process or something). Lex, being Lex, isn't a particularly exciting Minifig, although he does have a pretty cool suit. And <a href=""http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Lex_Luthor's_Warsuit"">Power Armor</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>The pictures really don't do the Power Armor much justice. The build is fairly simple and consists almost entirely of specialised pieces that you probably won't find much use for elsewhere, but the finished product is really quite unique. What you end up with is essentially a big action figure made out of LEGO, one that's highly posable and scales pretty well with, say, LEGO City sets. Excluding the bendy Krypto-pipe-thing that ostensibly powers the Krypto-ray-gun, the Power Armor stands about an inch or so shorter than Tripod Invader (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7051-1"">7051</a>) but is slightly taller than the bank from Bank &amp; Money Transfer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661</a>), which makes him perfect for going on a city-wide rampage. I can guarantee you that you will be quite surprised at how flexible he is.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you're into comic books, robot suits, or just plain ol' urban destruction, Lex Luthor is your man, and you won't be sorry with the Minifigs if you are even a passing fan of DC Comics. Alternatively, if you own any of recent LEGO airplanes, you can effectively recreate the airplane disaster scene from <i>Superman Returns</i>, although that would unfortunately mean acknowledging the existence of that movie, which not all of you may want to do (I personally thought it was alright, especially if you have had the true misfortune of sitting through <i>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</i>).</div><div><br></div><div>All I need to do now is hold my breath until they come up with an <a href=""http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Bernhard_Baker_(New_Earth)"">Animal Man</a> Minifig.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4

</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good price: at $20 for 207 pieces, this is a great price for a licensed set.</li><li>Great figures: as the only retail source for these iconic characters (at time of review), how could you turn it down? With 8 or so versions of Batman but only one of Wonder Woman and Superman, you need this set to collect the ""royalty"" of the DC universe.</li><li>Good parts: elements in purple and green as well as some less-common transparent elements (especially the windscreen) make this a decent parts pack. Some ball joint, click joint, and curved elements round out the selection.</li><li>Quick build: I assembled this set in about half an hour, which made it perfect for that little bit of down time before work.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Quick build: I assembled this set in about half an hour. If you're looking for an involved build, this isn't it.</li><li>Repetitive elements/construction: for those who have been collecting over the past ten years or so, a number of ""mech"" options have been available- most notably the Exo-Force line. This set repeats several construction techniques and elements from that line, so you won't learn many new techniques and you'll end up with more of those joints that can be tough to use.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a nice $20 set. There are lots of things to love and the drawbacks are only minor quibbles. I'm looking forward to getting home and putting a stop to Lex Luthor's nefarious kryptonite-fueled schemes!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"sudorum","2012-06-07T20:37:49.383Z","It's a bird! It's a plane! No-it's SUPERMAN!","Who actually bought this set for the giant Lex robot? Probably no one. Superman, his arch nemesis, Lex Luther, and his female counterpart, Wonder Woman, are undoubtedly the selling points. Fortunately, Lego did everyone a favor by including these rare figures in a small, adequately priced set. Superman is a flawless rendition of the comic book hero. He has the cape, the spit curl, and, of course, the iconic emblem emblazoned on his chest. Even if you're not a fan, these characters are still worth owning. The Superman minifigure alone is already being sold online for around fifteen dollars (not that you would buy the set just to sell Superman later). Though Wonder Woman isn't nearly as legendary as the omnipotent man of steel, her minifigure is just as intricately detailed. She also comes with a brand new lego lasso. Lex Luther isn't as colorful or flashy as the other two, but hey...cut the guy a break. He's got a robot to make up for his banal appearance. His power armor suit is adorned in kryptonite, which is represented by the new green translucent pieces utilized. I'm not sure if these pieces have been used in other sets before, but if they have been, it was to a minimum amount. One last point of interest. Lex's face is suspiciously similar to Superman's, with the only real difference being the prominence of Superman's cheeks. Perhaps the two life-long enemies are more alike than they seem...",FALSE,3,5,3,3,5
"Berrus_Brickus","2012-03-04T17:55:11.817Z","Do all corrupted politicians drive mechs?","<p>This is the only Superman set in the first DC Universe wave, and possibly the most anticipated set of the wave. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions </h4>
<p>Unlike the Batman sets which mostly show a night-time setting, Lex seems to be attacking Metropolis in broad daylight. The front is okay, but the back really is ugly. Purple and green don't look good against yellow. The box is different from the other DC sets as there is a cartoon Superman in Batman's normal spot. </p>
<h4>Parts </h4>
<p>I'm not a fan of Superman or mechs. For the most part, I only bought the set for Wonder Woman (not a fan of her either though), Lex Luthor, and the parts. I don't think they disappoint. For $20 (US), 207 parts comes just above the golden ratio, plus this is a licensed set. </p>
<p>A lot of purple and green, which is great. There is also some Transparent Bright Green which was introduced in Atlantis a couple years ago. I didn't like it then (against red), but it looks good with green. There are other useful parts too, like ball joint bricks and ""cheese graters"" and the dome pieces. </p>
<p>I'm not a fan of mechs, so I'll probably disassemble the set to use the parts for The Joker and The Riddler-themed vehicles. </p>
<h4>Minifigures </h4>
<p>The three minifigures are exclusive (though it doesn't seem like they will all be), and possibly the main draw of the set. For most people at least, I would of skipped it if it wasn't for the parts (and I have some ideas for Lex Luthor). </p>
<p><strong>Superman <br/></strong>Superman, yay! Not really, I'm not a Superman fan, and he is probably one of my least favorite mainstream super heroes (but <em>not</em> my least favorite). </p>
<p>The torso is very good, both the front and back printing. The legs and cape both work well. The face is pretty ugly though. It looks a lot like Bruce Wayne's (which I wasn't overly fond of in the first place), except older. I have some uses for it though. I don't like the hair either (which is molded in China btw), it just looks strange on a minifigure. Mutt Williams' hair in black looks nicer, I think. On the instructions background, he is shown with a less Bruce-esque face and Mutt's hair, which looks better. </p>
<p><strong>Lex Luthor <br/></strong>Even though I don't like Superman, I don't hate Lex Luthor. He's a buisnessman, millionaire (or maybe a billionaire, I don't know), and a philantropist. He's also a corrupt politician though. Nothing says corrupt politician like rampaging a brightly colored mech through a street. </p>
<p>As a minifigure, there isn't much to say. I plan on giving him a black hairpiece and making Harvey Dent, his face is pretty similar to the good side of Two-Face's. </p>
<p><strong>Wonder Woman <br/></strong>I said earlier that Superman was almost my least favorite mainstream super hero. Wonder Woman is my least favorite; she's just like Superman, except she's in a woman's body (nothing wrong with that), has an arsenal of weapons which I have to wonder (he he...) how someone came up with them (bulletproof bracelets? A lasso that makes people tell the truth? A boomerang tiara that hides her identity?), and she gives other female super heroes a bad name because she's so superficial and melodrmatic. I wouldn't call her the worst super hero though, at least not after reading <a href=""http://popcultureaddict.com/comic-books/lamestsuperheroes-htm/"">this</a> (I particularly like the one who welds dogs to peoples' faces). </p>
<p>As a minifigure she's nice though. The face is useful, and I'm sure that you could find uses for the hair and torso, but I think I'll keeps her together. Unlike some, I don't think she looks pudgy. Well, she does when she has the bracelets I made for her on (I couldn't resist, they're so stupidly attravtive). I don't oppose to the legs being red with the flesh parts printed on, the alternative would of been open heals on the boots and a thong, printing the legs on red seems to be the lesser of two evils. I don't think that the flesh printing looks like stockings (but in an unrelated note, I do think Wonder Woman should wear stockings, I'd think she'd get cold :P ). The only time that the red on the back really looks weird to me is when she's posed at an angle where you can see the side and back. </p>
<p>The lasso really does look stupid when it isn't posed right. It is stupid though, so whatever. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Controversy <br/></strong>The legs are Chinese plastic as Brickset pointed out. However, both Wonder Woman and Superman's hairpieces are also Chinese made. Huw believes that we should excuse some molded pieces from China because they are so detailed, like these hairpieces. However, these legs are also very detailed. There are the stars on the tights and the printing on the sides (I can't think of an example of a minifigure with printing on the side of their legs who wasn't from China). It's just a pair of detailed legs. I don't see why we can't excuse them like we would the hair. I don't think it's a precursor to all minifigures being made in China, at least not more than before, the legs are more detailed than minifigures produced elsewhere. Sure, I'd prefer Danish or Mexican plastic, but I don't see why these can't be excused.</p>
<h4>The Build </h4>
<p>Just the mech build from the feet up. It was pretty average, not too interseting, not too boring. Nothing really stand out. </p>
<h4>The Completed </h4>
<p>Model I'm not a mech fan, I actually almost went into a dark age during the Exo-Force era, most of the LEGO sets from that time were horrible, except for City had started to get better, so I made it through. </p>
<p>Anyway, I guess it's okay for a LEGO mech. One arm is longer than the other though, which is strange. I like the colorscheme, except I don't know why it belongs to Lex Luthor, purple and green don't exactly scream ""serious"" like he does. <br/></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I recomend this set, but I don't think that you need me to tell you to get it, it was probably one of the most anticipated sets (at least until pictures of 6857 surfaced). Just two things first; </p>
<ul>
<li>Of all the current DC sets, I think 6864 actually has the best value. <br/>I don't get the set-up of the set, Superman coming to rescue Wonder Woman who has been captured by (Lex Luthor in) a kryptonite mech. Any other mech and Superman could rescue WW in a few seconds, but a kryptonite one? Wouldn't Woner Woman have a better chance at defeating that? <br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</li></ul>
<p>I feel I actually have to explain some of my ratings here; </p>
<ul>
<li>Building Experience only gets a three because it wasn't really stand out <br/>I overthought the set-up of the set above, but ignoring that, Superman&nbsp;alone has great playability, (mostly) no matter what, so it gets an easy five

That first batch was highly dissapointing as it only featured designs and set ideas we'd seen previously. Many of the DC Sets were just re-imagined Batman sets, some of the models were smaller, more compact and the prices were all different. But we'd kind of seen a lot of them before.</p>
<p>This set stands out as the most unique and most impressive of the 2012 wave for the simple fact that it wasn't just a re-hash. And it included three Mini-Figures we'd never seen before, while many of the 2012 DC sets have featured improved updates to the original 2006-08 Batman Theme these are all new, and much appreciated.</p>

<p>The box for this set is pretty standard for the LEGO DC Super Heroes Theme, much like in my previous review of the Batwing set I still find this design much better thought out than the older&nbsp;Batman one. This one shows off the set and its features in typical fashion.</p>
<p>The instructions and 'comic' which are included are loose. There is no cardboard protection, unfortunately this means you could have some really beat up looking instructions straight out of the box. I think I've beat that thought home to you by now in many of my more recent reviews. LEGO, please find a better method of packing the instructions if you aren't going to give them all cardboard protectors. Please and thank you.</p>
<p>The above being said however these instructions are more of a booklet form, chances are it may not be as damaged as it could be because they are a bit smaller than the ones ordinarily found in these sets. They aren't too difficult to follow either.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are some really interesting pieces in this set, part ID #4155558 and 4220098 are some really unique looking parts I haven't seen too often, mostly because I tend not to buy Technic based sets or the Hero Factory/Constraction style sets where joints and things would be more commonplace. Both parts are great for MOCers, you also get a fair number of green pieces here and some nice joint parts for building poseable robots.</p>
<p>Great part choices LEGO making this a useful parts pack if you're interested in such things, I love the cockpit design, it's nothing new, but this is the first time I think I got one of these newer Space themed cockpit windows.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Classic Superman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor, all three of these Mini-Figures are awesome. Brand new to this set, unique and haven't been seen since. (Although Superman was available as an SDCC exclusive or NYCC I always get those two mixed up, and Wonder Woman does have parts made in China if you're opposed to such things.)</p>
<p>Superman is just great, he's got a double-sided torso showing off the muscles on his back, is wearing his classic blue and red uniform with the red cape and has the jerry curl in his hairpiece. (I think that's what its called.) Overall an excellent representation of the character in his classic comic book form. This versions double-sided facial print features a determined expression for battling Lex and one with the trademark smile we saw in the LEGO Batman 2 game. No heat vision eyes here.</p>
<p>Lex Luthor is a standard looking suit, minimal print work here, I can't recall if he has a double-sided torso, but something tells me he might not. (He's still on the shelf in the robot armor so I can't verify it.) He's pretty standard, in fact his head is even re-used later on for Loki of all Mini-Figs, but it's still nice to have a version of Lex on the shelf.</p>
<p>Wonder Woman is also in her classic unitard look with the star spangled shorts. She's got the most chinese parts on her, mostly because of the unique printing involved with her legs and torso (which again is Double-sided). Her hair is also a piece made in china, she has the tiara painted and sculpted onto it if I'm not mistaken... Yes, yes it is. Her double-sided face is happy on one side, angry and determined on the other, and she includes her trademark lasso, which is a new piece.</p>
<p>All in all a great trio of Mini-Figures for the price point, which is a trend amongst LEGO Super Heroes sets.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>You're building a giant robotic suit of armor straight out of the game, some of the steps can become a bit repetitive when building identical arms and legs, but it's a fast fun build that looks great once completed.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Power Armor matches the model found in the LEGO Batman 2 game pretty faithfully, it includes the Destructor Gun which is powered by Kryptonite (also included in this set) and in fact includes enough transparent green bits to make it look like everything is powered by Kryptonite.</p>
<p>The new joints introduced by LEGO in recent years improve the stability of the poses this armour can take. Often I'll find certain balljoints weakening due to the heavy nature of the builds placed upon them, not the case here it's a solid looking suit of armor for Lex to command.</p>
<p>The weakest aspect of it would actually have to be the cockpit, in-game the design is slapped together haphazardly from the Joker's robot remains so it makes sense to be a bit questionable in the sturdy department. One good Batarang would smash that glass dome open pretty quickly though, still the model works for what it is meant to be and great fun to play with towering over all your Super Heroes.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is definitely a must own set, not only is it the only set where Wonder Woman, Lex and Classic Comic Supes are available, but it sets the standard for this price point in the LEGO Super Heroes theme. Just about every set after this one to share in this price point has been a real winner, be it the Mini-Figs, the models or a combination of both.</p>
<p>There are a few minor complaints for LEGO purists, after all one of the Mini-Figures is mostly made in China and we all know how some collectors feel about that. I say don't let that ruin this set for you though, chances are we won't be seeing Wonder Woman again any time soon, and when we do it'll be part of the Man of Steel 2 sets from 2015 so it won't be the same design.</p>
<p>Also, before I forget, there are no stickers for details in this set. You get two of the hose piece, one for the cannon build the other as a spare which is useful in MOCs or to just have in case of breakage. All in all this is a great set worth picking up, it has the best price point for the Mini-Figs included and (it's the only set without Batman from DC, or it was until Man of Steel stuff showed up). Strongly recommended, and once its discontinued I feel it'll make a good investment as well.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"tkettle9719","2013-06-21T13:27:49.327Z","The Man of Steel vs. His Greatest Enemy","<p>I got this set from Amazon a few months ago, initially because I had gained a recent interest in the set. I love mechs (as seen in the sheer number of my Exo-Force reviews), and Man of Steel (which is an excellent movie) was coming out this year, so what better way to celebrate than to get this set? This was the only set I was interested in also, mainly because I didn't like the Man of Steel themed sets, and having seen the movie, I believe that the only good set is the Black Zero Escape. This set, however, still stands above it. I got it at full price, and I have to say that I really like it except for one certain area...<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>As always, Lego seems to be pulling out all of the stops for their minifigure lineup. Lex Luthor is probably the plainest, but his suit is still up to par, and the Superman presented here is just a marvelous spectacle to behold. Wonder Woman is probably the best minifig here, with the exception of her back leg printing, which is all red. <br></li><li>The mech is designed beautifully; it has mostly black and gray pieces, but the purple and green here are plentiful as well and give it a certain POW! to the set. It is also quite bulky considering its size (which is smaller than I thought it would be), and feels like something right out of the films. <br></li><li>The detailing is so good that this set actually needs no stickers (it doesn't include any, thankfully). The gun, for instance, which has a Kryptonite crystal, could easily have been a sticker piece, but thankfully it wasn't. Quite a refreshing change from the usual set niche. Another thing I love in the detailing is the tube which is connected the the gun. The set is very aesthetically pleasing. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The play features of this set are more limited than other sets at this price range; although this is a great set for the imagination, kids who like to actually use physical attacks on Superman will be disappointed more than others. The only real feature I see here is that the mech moves, which is a bit... eh. <br></li><li>While the top half of this set is (very) versatile and flexible with modeling, the bottom half is dreadful with the posing department. The leg itself can go all four ways, but it can only move a small bit if you'd like it to actually stand up. This is the bit that really upsets me, and something that made Exo-Force stand out. <br></li><li>The final thing, which doesn't bother me all that much, is that the set picture shows Wonder Woman stuck in the archetypical damsel in distress situation, with Superman having to save her. However, because the mech is made of Kryptonite, wouldn't both of the heroes be screwed? Just an interesting discovery I made...<br></li></ul>
<p>This set is excellently made. Its colors are spot-on, and it has some real meat to it. The figures and lack of stickers also make this a real treat for anyone who is a fan of DC. However, I just can't give it full marks due to the lack of posing options and the strange (lack of) play features for kids. I recommend it for an older fan of DC for sure (AFOLs will love this), but I think the kids get the rotten end on this one. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"gustavowizard","2012-02-23T16:04:48.39Z","This is a Beautiful set!","This is a GREAT set, for start, it comes with 3 Famous figurines; Superman, Lex Luthor and Wonder Woman, i mean, if you are a fan of DC and Marvel like me, its A MUST HAVE!<br>When i first looked this set i tought the robot was not that cool, but for real, when i mounted it i got a nice surprise; it was most more beautiful than i tought and its articulations are far more functionable than i tought too, i mean you can really make any position you want (cause i think on the picture hes not that nice) and it really look like more nice on live then on the pictures here.<br>I recommend this set 100%, the price is not that outrageous like the star wars on Brasil and its a great acquisition!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
