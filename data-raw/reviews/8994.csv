The color scheme isn't very exciting, the minifigures are dull (literally dull in color) but the dinosaur molds are AMAZING. And the sets are starting to win me over.<div><br></div><div>I bought this set for $76, which seems like the right price. The MSRP of $99 is just too high for this 793 piece set.</div><div><br></div><div>This set reminds me a lot of the Exo-Force Sentai Headquarters (also $99, but it had 1448 pieces--almost DOUBLE the pieces!)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DINO HQ is, essentially, a big fence. With a control tower and a few stations built in. It has a HUGE footprint. It really is large--also tall. The control tower/trap gate is 10"" high--that's taller than the Creator Lighthouse. From the pictures, I assumed the back gate would have a trap mechanism where the gate would drop, trapping the unsuspecting dinosaurs inside. Unfortunately, the gate just uses the old, string+wench mechanism. So, I guess the dinosaurs just wait patiently while the gate slowly lowers. Twist-twist-twist-twist</div><div><br></div><div>There are a lot of nice pieces here, though. The gates themselves are a new mold. There are tons of the new corner bracket in yellow, lots of large yellow wall pieces, and the rare 12 stud windshield.</div><div><br></div><div>The real stars of the set are the dinosaurs themselves. LEGO has <i>really</i> gotten it right this time, not like the horrible, rubbery DINO ATTACK 2010 dinos or the mostly solid-state Adventurers dinos from the 90s. These are really gorgeous. Blocky, LEGO-y, but very detailed with nice clicking jaws. Seriously, these dinosaurs are great. They must be where the extra cost comes in.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a three star set. The extra star is for the dinos.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
"kingbrick","2012-04-09T06:17:14.557Z","Great set with plenty of play options.","<p>A fun set with plenty of concepts (helicopter, movable generator, buggy, various HQ features) for different play scenarios. T-Rex model is very cool indeed. I like the&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;of the design very much. -While figures and colors are nothing very exciting, it has a pseudo-military feel which is very cool and highly appropriate to the serious and dangerous business of capturing and containing dinosaurs! :-)</p><p><br></p><p>The scale of the HQ is big, although, the T-Rex is&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;large too! :-) In fact everything in the base seems to be at T-Rex height, which is very funny, kind of like a buffet for the T-Rex, he just has to turn around on the spot to munch on anything in the base!</p><p><br></p><p>I'm not sure this theme is going to be continued, but I would absolutely love it if they expanded on this theme, maybe a&nbsp;laboratory? .. Or... theme.. park, maybe? :-D</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun, very-posable T-Rex, one posable raptor and a rubber compy dino.</li><li>Double grey-plugged modular connections allow different HQ configurations.</li><li>Nice details like warning signs.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Quite a few stickers.</li><li>The rubbery compy isn't posable.</li><li>More of an arena, only two small rooms in the HQ.</li></ul>
<p>Prices in Switzerland are always that bit more expensive, but I wanted that T-Rex, and the set in general is a lot of fun with plenty to play with.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, absolutely no regret over this fun set, but I only wish they would do more to expand the theme.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"masterchief77","2012-10-25T16:31:13.973Z","Dino Defense Headquarters...","<p>Let me start off with saying that this set is very cool, although I would have liked to have thought of this set as a viewing cage for the T-rex instead of an HQ. The ""HQ"" as Lego calls it is reasonably larger than you would epect from a 793 piece set. There is a lab up top with 2 computer screens and ""spinning chair"". there is a small ""observation room with a removable tranquilizer refill station. One of the ""balcony-type"" structures has a revolving turret with 2 flick-fire missles (the turret can also move up and down) and also has a spotlight/searchlight in front of it. the other balcony structure has a small cargo crane with a removable rope net to put the Celophysis in, and the crane can revolve around 360 degrees (like the flick-fire turret) and is also poseable. Also the front gates can be swung open and can be locked with a small grey chain piece. The back gates can be raised and lowered with a small rope/tether crank and gear piece type system.</p>
<p>Minifigures included:</p>
<p>*Team leader and desendent of Johnny Thunder, Josh Thunder (the guy with the combed and parted black hair (and I am not making up the names if you think I am (Lego has confirmed the names as true))).</p>
<p>*The ""chick"" explorer is named Sue Montana.</p>
<p>*The pilot with flight helmet and goggles.</p>
<p>*And Driver (I have no idea as to why Lego would give him a pilot's helmet when he is a vehicle driver :P ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dinosaurs included:</p>
<p>*A small non-poseable Celophysis.</p>
<p>*A small/medium sized, poseable Velocarapter/Utahrapter.</p>
<p>*And A nice sized poseable Tyrannosaurus-Rex/T-rex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicles included:</p>
<p>*A small safari/hunting jeep with ramming grill,storage unit for one crate that holds a wrench and anvil/hammer, a drivers seat, a place to hold a walkie-talkie and tranquilizer gun, and finally a small flick-fire (oh dear Lego you have too many flick fire missles) missle launcher.</p>
<p>*The mini-helicopter has a small rovolving propeller in the back and top, raising and lowering wings with non firing missles,and a place for the pilot with 2 leavers to control the movements (in this case they don't) of the helicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acceseries included: 4 lime green syringes, 4 gun-metal grey tranq-guns, and an anvil/hammer and wrench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instruction manuals: 3 different sized manuals (like the evolutionary stages of a poke'mon (small,medium,large).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>*minifigures.</p>
<p>*accesories.</p>
<p>*dinos.</p>
<p>*hq.</p>
<p>*vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>*The price!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The box art:</p>
<p>The T-rex is shown to be escaping aswell as the Rapter and Celophysis being surrounded by the Driver driving the jeep and Josh Thunder pointing a tranq gun at the Celophysis, the front gates are swinging open, Sue Montana pointing&nbsp;a tranq gun into the mouth of the T-rex, the helicopeter is being shown as swooping over the scene shining a spotlight on the T-rex, it is either morning or dusk with the sky's color, we see a very large jungle with a paved road leading to the city with a large perimeter fence to keep the dinos from going on a rampage (but that failed), the usual Lego logo in the top left corner of the box with it's usual info on the set (ages, set number and name, piece count) And a large beat-up and battle damaged DINO logo with a T-rex roaring and glaring at you. Thank you for taking time to read this review and I hope you have found it helpful :D</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
