"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-29T02:39:04Z","A ready-built diorama!","OMG! This is such an awesome set! There are almost 700 pcs and 7 minifigs (with the oft requested Lando) and 4 different areas to play with (Carbon Freezing Chamber, Landing Platform, Dining Area, Luke &amp; Darth Duel area). Not too difficult to build and lots of small details and moving parts (freezing chamber, doors, window). The playability of this set is a 10 and more if you have the Cloud Car, Slave 1, or Millennium Falcon! 

A fantastic set and a must have!!! Now only if they do something like this for the Death Star and Death Star II!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-31T01:36:44Z","LEGO is bound for the Heavens!","This set comes with just under 700 pieces, 7 minifigs, and an abundance of playability! It also includes Lando (finally!) and an improved Boba Fett. It is a UCS because of its size and the fact that it is an entire backdrop from the films in one set (I know the Dagobah X-Wing set is too) but that is a smaller set than even some other SW ships). The lack of walls/dividers between the rooms is not upsetting to me because of the way the colorscemes are used to differentiate each of the classic scenes depicted within the set. The moving parts are a nice touch and being able to position so many minifigs in one set for so many different scenes is exciting and empowering. Most Lego sets (esp. SW) are only designed for one setup and you have little room for interpretation but this set gives you the freedom to create several scenarios and it can easily be complimented with other less expensive sets.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-19T06:25:24Z","Interesting...............","This one I believe I am going to keep in the box just because there is nothing more to see than what the picture shows.  Awesome figs, but the scene depicted is all wrong.  Lego should have made this into a few separate sets (For cheaper prices) with the option of combining them all into one large scene.  Craming everything together for $100 was a silly idea.  I think this one will be worth a good deal later which is why it will remain unopened.  In fact, I am not really sure if I want to say that it is even worth buying unless you plan on keeping it sealed because those figures are really the only thing that make it a decent set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-02T19:49:50Z","Now this is great...","Many people are like &quot;This is inaccurate!!!&quot;. Who cares? There are so many great play features! It is also compatible with cloud cars and the new millenium falcon. I have all these sets and I think they all make this set even better. I like the figs in this set and it is just so cool. As I said the sets do not have to be accurate to be good!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T02:56:14Z","What's so crummy about this set?","THIS SET ROCKS MY SOCKS..... Adam, you can't spell and don't know a great set when you see one, even if it fell out of the sky and hit you over the head. The platform at the back of the set is wicked, as you could put the millenium falcon or cloud car pod on it. The fact it has no walls just makes playability easier and more fun and as for displaying it, it takes away the dull, individual chunks that divide the rooms up.
Bonus:
Cool rooms
Minfigs and platform big bonus

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T17:30:52Z","Better than expected","I got this set for $49 on clearance from Amazon a couple of months ago.  Movie inaccuracies aside, it is really quite a neat set with good playability.  Especially cool is that the landing platform is large enough to accomodate the new Millenium Falcon.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers' statements about packaging; LEGO would have been much better off packaging this as 3-4 separated modules.

My main complaints:  
1.  Dimensions - this set is almost as wide as it is long (primarily due to how far the landing platform extends from the dining ares), thus rendering it difficult to display.  

2.  Minifigs - Although Lando and Cloud City Leia are cool, I don't need another Boba Fett, Vader, or Stormtroopers.  I understand why LEGO included the last three in that they relate to the scenes represented by the set, but why no Ugnaughts or Cloud City Guards?  Fortunately Lobot is a cheap pickup with the Cloud Car set.

Notice what I paid; although I like the set now that I own it, I would not have paid $99 for it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-25T01:47:13Z","this set is way cool","I don't understand such negativity from some of the people here. Yes, its easy to build, yes there are no walls, but to have all the different important scenes in one set is way cool. The fact that the landing pad it large enough to be used by many ships (x-wing, cloud car, falcon,pretty much anything that is a ship in the star wars universe makes this an awesome set to play with. 

",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T02:36:28Z","Cloud City","OK first off all I don't get the negativity behind this set. It's supposed to be a playset, not a diorama so off course it's not going to be completly accurate. That aside I love this set. It's a fun (although basic) build, the minifigures are awesome - especially Lando and the newer more decorated Boba Fett, and it has some nice features. My only real problem with this set is the Carbonite Chamber. The mechanism to lower/rise Han can get caught near the top and needs to be pulled up/down manually. I do find it strange how Leia has Padme's Tatooine hairstyle from Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Lego saving money by using old molds or another new change for the next edition of the Original Trilogy? Hmmm... 

Pros:
* Updated Boba Fett and new Bespin Luke, Bespin Leia and Lando minifigures
* Awesome playset recreating the key locations of Cloud Citythe majority of SW ships
* Dining room door and duel room mechanisms

Cons:

* Landing platform can fit * The carbon chamber mechanism doesn't work too well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-18T17:13:24.107Z","blah","this set is horrible. the only good things are the detailed figs, cool pieces and landing pad. now to list the minuses

hard to store
blast open window is realy flimsy
no walls. why no walls to divide the rooms?
luke is supposed to duel in the botton of cloud city. not the same level.
its so flippin cramped.

things could have been done to be improved

it could be like 3 levels.
it could have had dividers
it could have had a better structure

this set sucks!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"sethlee","2007-11-24T00:48:42.437Z","WHAT!","i don't know but i have a lots of reasons why i don't like this set

2. its so fagle to break

3. it has too many characters

4. the camber is so small

5. wheres chewe

"sudorum","2008-05-04T16:15:26.14Z","How could this set not be good?","Probably one of my favorite star wars sets. Includes an enhanced Boba, LANDO CALRISSIAN, Luke, Leia, Darth Vader, Han, and a storm trooper! seven minifigs and people think the set's bad? Not only is it compatible with the second millenium falcon, but it's three scenes combined into one! the middle room has an opening door unique from others, the carbonite chamber carbonites Han (jams sometimes, but can be fixed!) and the battle scene has a falling wall and a window that sends Luke flying! captures the movie very well! Set isn't avaliable any more, but thats why there's ebay!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-12-30T05:18:36.86Z","Great set as a starter for building a greater set","This is, in spite of all the down sides mentioned in other reviews, a great set:
- Lots of minifigures
- 3 scenes with much detail, and well designed colour schemes
- Every scene has its own playability:
- Entrance with sliding door giving access to landing platform
- Carbonite room with inventive mechanism to change Han Solo into carbonite Han. This works manually and doesn’t work very smooth, but is OK.
- Dining room with some nice details.
- Duelling room with nice mechanisms for a falling wall and for the window breaking and taking Luke out of the room.
- Landing platform

The down sides mentioned in other reviews can easily be answered:
- Cramped, no separate rooms, no walls: the open structure makes for a great playability.
- Bad working mechanisms: hey, I think they’re quite inventive.
- Too few minifigures: OK, there could have been more stormtroopers.

Advice: 
- use this set as a starter for building a bigger set on a great grey base plate. 
- Make a greater landing platform with the four quarter round plates. Add your other sets like MF, Slave and twin-pod.
- Ad some extra rooms as the prison  area, the dining room where they meet Darth, or the droid room.
- Have fun building and playing!

"Sebastian","2009-10-07T03:03:42.217Z","Good wall design","When this set was still available on S@H I had to weigh up if I should get this or some old sets. The minifigures were tempting but not enough of a reason for me to buy a set at that price. However, when I was thinking if I should order it or not I wasn't aware of the detailled and nice-looking facade (landing platform view) as I had only seen the play area view. I think design-wise this was really the best part of the set. When I finally had the set I also liked the door mechanism (I'm a fan of door mechanisms anyway:p). Moreover, I don't really see this set as a playset. It is more something like a sort of display case to pose and show off the figs. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"joelmama29","2009-11-12T23:35:59.95Z","ONCE IN A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY!","Well believe it or not I was able to buy this set for $50.00 bucks for a brand new sealed cloud city! Looking at all the prices on Ebay and Amazon I was not going to pass up on this deal. Well I was shocked this set is great even though most of the reviews are so negative. First of all the building is simple but its construction is solid. Just like Jabba's Palace you can seperate the play scenes for playbility or even to build and make it bigger. I like how you have five scenes from the movie to recreate. The landing pad is great you can put the millinum falcon or the Slave I ship. But the best part of this set has to be the mini figs that are exclusive to this set. This set is great and from what I can see on the web this is the ULTIMATE COLLECTIOR SET of all lego sets! If you have a chance to get one jump on it! 

PROS:
Mini Figs 
-     Boba Fett with Printed Legs and Arms
-     Lando in his Cloud City Outfit
-     Cloud City Princess Leia
-     Luke Skywalker
-     Darth Vader
-     Storm Trooper
