And it's very reasonably priced at $39.99 especially given that it contains 77 pieces including fun pieces like a mirror (that really reflects), a golden treasure chest, 2 little beds and a balcony. The closest Duplo set in terms of number of pieces that I could find on lego.com was the 6156 Photo Safari set and that contains 67 pieces for $59.99.<div><br></div><div>I like how there are basically 3 floor levels for the castle section (a living room floor, a bedroom floor and balcony) plus a big grand golden door section. I purchased the other 3 sets in the Duplo Disney Princess series (all are reasonably priced too, in my opinion, though I'm still the most impressed by this set) and I think the 6153 Cinderella's Carriage and 6151 Sleeping Beauty's Room sets would combine quite well with this set. It might be a bit more difficult to incorporate the 6152 Snow White's Cottage set with this one due to the different colour scheme particularly the yellow bricks.</div><div><br></div><div>I am planning to purchase one or two extra sets to give as birthday gifts especially if I eventually get it on sale for $5 or $10 less. &nbsp;A great set overall.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
