This set wasn't my aim though&nbsp;when I was hunting for some well deserved lego. Best of all, no stickers!&nbsp;On with the review.</p>
<p><strong>The figures</strong></p>
<p>The flying dutchman is mostly green, with&nbsp;a new&nbsp;dark green head, because his head is mostly hairy, so his&nbsp;pale green&nbsp;face is printed on unlike other minifig heads. the hat is the same as Davy Jones's hat from the Black Pearl POTC set, except green and a printed rip on the front along&nbsp;with a printed light green&nbsp;line. He does look weird when you look at him from the left,&nbsp;because his printed nose is pointing to the right. The same dumb old&nbsp;cutlass is in his hand, and Indy's satchel is slapped on him&nbsp;with a pale light green hue. His hands are new neon light green and his ghosty tail is the same as the genie's in CM series 6. Spongebob and Patrick are in their piratey attire, and spongebob's hat has a printed square skull and bones which I didn't realize from the pic. Patrick has a cool new map which you could reuse along with his torso for a custom pirate.</p>
<p><strong>The ship</strong></p>
<p>The ship is ghosty green, of course you get alot of green pieces for that creepy look. The sail is hard plastic and the emblem is printed on, not a sticker, though it is only held up with one clip brick on the back, so it is not that sturdy.&nbsp;The stem with the&nbsp;flag on the crow's nest kept falling off, but I realized that you need to sandwich the triangular cylinder between the four studs in the crows nest. the front brown piece is new, and it is a great new piece made just for this ship. the steering wheel is the average car steering wheel, which isn't right for a ship. I do wish it came with an anchor, like any ship would. Also it is missing the two string ladders used to get up to the crow's nest. the cabin is the most creative part, where the window panes are brought back from old castle sets, and are slanted like a real ship's. It does come with a rudder, a simple triangle flag piece.</p>
<p><strong>The little&nbsp;island/ sand dune</strong></p>
<p>The little sand dune is simple, though it made perfect, because there is a hinged rock in the front and when you open it up, the treasure chest is hidden inside for the crew to get out. I am sad that lego got rid of the old gold coin pieces and replaced it with boring old pearl gold studs. The cannon is ordinary, but the wheel studs&nbsp;roll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this is a good set to have, but I wouldn't jump at the chance to get it. That is all. I hope you liked my review and will like&nbsp;your future set! :))</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,3

"rnsrobot","2014-09-11T17:40:50.793Z","Amazing","<p>I bought this set to give my daughter a little pirate ship to play with, since the Black Pearl is generally off-limits without supervision. Turns out it&#39;s a killer set!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a box! With Spongebob!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of green. The island is chockful of parts to use in other pirate or castle situations. Firing cannon. The ship hull will be harder to reuse but whatever.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Never really watched Spongebob but these are creative and fun. I do like that Spongebob has a stud on his head so you can attach all sorts of hats or bricks for fun. Treasure map!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set is the epitome of clever. The little island is more intricate than you&#39;d expect and creates a lot of texture and setting with a small piece&nbsp;count.&nbsp;The pirate ship itself is so well done. Uses hinges nicely to create the cartoony, disproportionate cabin. Little details make the difference and it&#39;s quite surprising how well it comes together. The rails and sail are a little easy to knock off but other than that...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very impressed with the great little scene and two solid, &quot;chibi&quot; but detailed models you get out of it. The ship certainly seems haunted and looks slightly creepy. Playability is good. Fire the cannon! Find the treasure chest! A figure can even walk the tiny plank. And it&#39;s a pirate ship, that&#39;s fun on its own.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Lego pirate ships are generally expensive, hundred dollar+ sets most kids can&#39;t afford. A small ship was a great idea, and the execution is great. If you&#39;re a Spongebob fan, great. If you aren&#39;t, ditch the minifigures and you&#39;ve got a great little pirate set. Thumbs up.</p>

"plantman","2012-09-06T18:23:23.653Z","My favorite Spongebob set!","<p>This set has so much going for it as I see it - Spongebob, Pirates, spooky/Halloween.&nbsp; A definite winner in my book.&nbsp; It includes the flying Duthcman, Pirate Spongebob and Pirate Patrick.&nbsp; The Dutchman is one of my all-time favorite figures.&nbsp; The set itself consists of a small ship and a little island.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The little ship is perfect for this little set.&nbsp; It contains black and green elements which add to the ghostly feel of the Dutchman.&nbsp; It has a little cabin with lanterns, a skull and bones sail, crowsnest and molded bow.&nbsp; On its own it reminds me of a mini set of a large ship.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The little island&nbsp;piece has a dock, rocks with plants and a cannon.&nbsp; The cannon fires little translucent blue studs (bubble cannon?).&nbsp; It also makes a great little accent piece that could go with any pirate themed display.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do think&nbsp;this should have been a $20 set, but I didn't hesitate at the $25&nbsp;shelf price - I love this set.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most are pretty limited in their range of use, but there&#39;s a few I could see working in something else.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is what really makes this set shine. For the $20 - $30 range of sets, this one feels a lot bigger than it is. Plus, due mostly to the overall silliness of it, it&#39;s enormously fun to put together. The island is also a lot more involved than it looks from the outside.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The tiny pirate ship. THE TINY PIRATE SHIP. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s cute, it&#39;s very well-detailed.&nbsp;One of&nbsp;the most endearing and&nbsp;creative things LEGO has ever produced.</p>

<p>The island is ugly, but it has some charm. It would be right at home on a mini-golf course.</p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t care about play value, but this one has too much to ignore. All three figures fit on the ship quite comfortably. Mix that with the cannon and island and buried treasure and&nbsp;pirate accessories, and you&#39;ve got a childhood dream come true.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even for&nbsp;LEGO fans&nbsp;who don&#39;t like SpongeBob (if there are any), this set has a lot of fun to offer.</p>
