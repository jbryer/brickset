Its focus is on helping children learn to identify shapes by placing the animal pieces in the appropriate space in the template.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The three animals and tree are cute designs with eye catching colors for which DUPLO is known. This bucket could travel well on a trip entertaining Junior for a while, especially if one throws in about a dozen more bricks to add variety to the builds.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My only complaint is that the bucket is too large for the set being about half empty, or that there are too few bricks in the bucket. LEGO tried to keep the price low at 14.99US, but a few more bricks would have sweetened the deal. This would make a nice gift for a little one and could lead a child into CFOLhood if followed by more enticing sets as kiddo ages.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The coolest thing about this set is that it requires some imagination to create other builds by adding just a few more bricks. The parts can be built in many different ways, unlike many sets with multiple pages of instructions leading to just one build.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
