The houses are very detailed and are a lot of fun to build. There are some nifty tricks built into these designs. Add to that the exclusivity, it is only available to VIP members, and the fact that it has 1356 pieces for only $79.95 is a great bargain (that's 6 cents per piece). Granted, the pieces are almost all small, but that also means you get lots of spares.<div><br></div><div>All in all a great set for fans and people who do not have the money to buy the large versions of these houses.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5
"Kyriepat","2012-02-05T02:08:03.89Z","Cute Set","Yea, when I finished building it, I looked at it and went, ""Wow, there's a thousand pieces in this!?!"" lol<div><br></div><div>Definitely more detailed than I thought it would be, it's pretty cute next to the full sized modular sets. &nbsp;I started with the fire hall and didn't realize I was building the fire hall until I finished it. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I liked how they've separated the five buildings into five bags so you could pick which building you wanted to build in one sitting. &nbsp;Overall, it's a clever use of the small lego pieces. You do need a bit of dexterity and patience to build it. If you're like me, it bothered me that the single studded lego pieces rotate when fitted together and I have to rotate them so they're perfectly aligned.</div><div><br></div><div>I guess the only thing is that it's not really ""playable"", unless you attach and detach the buildings and rearrange them. &nbsp;It does look nice on my desk though.</div>",TRUE,4,5,5,2,5
"MCLegoboy","2012-08-15T09:38:48.68Z","Wonderful Exclusive Model","<p>I bought this out of having enough money while at my local LEGO store.&nbsp; I wanted it as it was a VIP member exclusive and a little collectors item.&nbsp; These models are fantastic and use many creative ways to create the minis.&nbsp; As I do not have the money to buy the full scale modulars, I was delighted to see these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is such a great set because of the pieces.&nbsp; Had I had enough money, I would have gotten another just for the parts.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind having all these little tiny pieces in fantastic colors or another brick seporater that LEGO seems to be adding to all their sets with multiple litte pieces and tiles and plates.&nbsp; Also, how often is it that you get good parts in a number of exotic colors all in one set? Not to mention some new parts.&nbsp; Now there aren't many, but there are a few.&nbsp; There are some 1x2 45 degree slopes with only a plate's height than a full brick, and the jumper plates in some colors have a groove on the bottom like the tiles.&nbsp; There are plenty of Jumper plates, 1x1 clear bricks, a bunch of trans-green pieces(No, not neon green or bright green.),&nbsp; sand green bricks, medium blue tiles and plates, a toilet seat if you find that sporting, and just plenty of 1x1 tile and plates in a slew of colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was building, I saw that the pieces were seperated into seperate bags so that each modular could be built seperately.&nbsp; This is great because with all the tiny parts, you can take a break knowing that you finished a model or if you just want to build a particular modular.&nbsp; I built it all one after another and it took me a little longer than probably normal becasue I wanted all the studs to face the same direction whenever possible because I wanted this model to be special, but if you just want to build it right away and one after another, it shouldn't take more than 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is a wonderful buy and I would recommend anyone to get it.&nbsp; However, this is an exclusive to VIP members only so if you aren't one already, sign up today for a chance to get it.&nbsp; For parts or display, this is fantastic.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"rcaffozee","2012-04-07T10:39:43.177Z","Great build for such little buildings","<p>This set was easy to build and a great way of the whole family to build together. Each member can build a building and then you can decide which one goes next to each other and whether you want a straight street or a corner of a block. You can change the order when ever you like. Lots of possibilities.</p>

"paul_merton","2012-06-16T14:50:45.87Z","Some nice building techniques","Each of the 5 buildings sits on an 8x8 plate and can be built independently. I quite like this sort of approach, as you can spend half an hour making a single building and then go and do something else without feeling like you've got to return to it.<br><br>There are two things I really liked about this set:<br><br>* There are some really neat parts and building techniques used in this set. You really have to experience it at first hand to understand what I mean, but there is of course a lot of SNOT (studs not on top) going on all over the place.<br><br>* The vast variety of small parts makes it incredibly easy to make your own modular buildings of a similar size. I couldn't resist buying a second set!<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
"CheeseyLU","2012-09-18T18:59:48.333Z","This set has a lot of small pieces which makes it fun to build, and you get a parts that are usually harder to come by. Even though it has a lot of pieces, the completed set is very small.","<p><strong>Mini Modulars</strong></p><p>As a huge fan of the modular building series, I had to get Mini Modulars. Sadly, it wasn't everything I thought it would be. Even so, it is a very neat set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is quite a variety of small pieces you usually don't find in sets, such as the 1x2x2 slopes and all those 1x1 plates in all those different colors. The printed ""HOTEL"" sign is also a plus, as we don't get many printed bricks any more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a very fun model to build, as I enjoy working with micro scale. Obiously, it's more of a display item than one to be played with. If you have a lot of microfigs from the LEGO Games, it might be kind of fun! :P I prefer it on my shelf and it looks very nice. However, he sun behind the coffe cup in the front of Cafe Corner was a bit too large, but that's my only con for looks. Even the back sides of the buildings were done very accurately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though there's a lot of pieces, for $80, the set doesn't amount up to much. It's very small, and I felt a little bit ripped off for what I payed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it's a great looking set with some great pieces, but a little to expensive.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"Branko","2013-03-12T20:59:23.34Z","More fun that the full modular buildings.","<p>This set is a fantastic way to stock up on modular buildings without bankrupting yourself on the full-size versions. If you have any interest in minute detail or clever building techniques you absolutely owe it to yourself to get this set.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows in good detail what you get and how you can position/display the modular houses in any way you like. The colours off some pieces are very similar so it is quite easy to mix them up sometimes because the colours do not match the pieces perfectly (as is quite common unfortunately). If you apply some logic it's not too hard to get it right though.</p><p>4.5/5<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>All parts are very common small pieces that can be used for anything you like with the sole exception of the ""Hotel"" sign which is printed! I was very happy to see that no stickers are involved in this set. Obviously you get many pieces for your money.<br></p><p>5/5</p><h4>The build</h4><p>FUN! When building some of the full sized modular buildings I sometimes found parts of the build repetitive or tedious. Certainly not so with this set. Because everything is so small you move through the build quickly and encounter interesting and clever build techniques often. After the build is complete I was even asked by other AFOLs 'how did they do that' about some parts of the build. It really is a extremely entertaining building experience but it requires a little bit of patience and focus (I would say age 8+ at least).</p><p>5/5<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed models are cute and beautiful. They look very nice together and because they are so small I have been able to put them on display in a bookcase in front of some books easily. As mentioned before there are no play features with this set: the entertainment is in the building and displaying.</p><p>4/5<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Get this set. You owe it to yourself and you will regret it if you don't. Plain and simple. I really hope Lego will make another set like this with the next 5 modular buildings.</p><p>5/5<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"rkc62","2013-07-28T20:59:39.25Z","So many parts, such a small model","<p>1356 pieces says it all really. Most are either 1x1 or 1x2 so it is still a very small model when it is done.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The individual bags (1 per building) make it easy to do it in stages</li><li>Interesting techniques - lots of SNOT and unique combinations - things that I sort of knew all along but never put together</li><li>Good looking when done</li><li>LOTS of spares for EACH building</li><li>Lots of rare colours - sand green, dark green, three different blues, trans green, etc</li></ul>
<div>Cons</div><ul><li>Probably smaller than I expected (maybe that adds to the charm?)</li><li>Playability is limited to swapping around the order they're attached to each other - it is purely a display model</li><li>It is a model of a Lego model, rather than a model of the buildings, so some of the design includes bits that the buildings would be better off without, but are included to faithfully reproduce the full-size modulars (some design features just didn't scale down well)</li><li>Instructions don't differentiate between the blues or dark red/brown well</li></ul>
<p>This was a lot of fun to build and some of the techniques will definitely come in handy with MOCs</p><p>Recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,2,4
"legofanatic2345","2012-12-26T14:41:50.337Z","A great set for collectors with small pieces and interesting building techniques","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre; "">	</span>When I got this set, my first impression was ""Wow, those are a lot of small bricks."" The set is meant to be a miniature in the first place, so any playability is pretty much thrown under the bus. This is clearly a set for collectors only. But, considering I am a collector, I really quite enjoyed the set. There are a lot of different and sometimes complex building techniques to use and were all really enjoyable to try. The end outcome was actually pretty accurate to the larger sets they represent. Don't expect a large set though- in reality, it is quite small. So, if you collect LEGOs, don't plan on playing with it, and enjoy building miniatures, then I would definitely recommend this set.",FALSE,5,5,5,2,4
