It isn't at my house (it's at a relative's house), otherwise I would've sent a pic to Brickset (which I will one day).

Since it's Duplo, the person is really weird looking, and everything's bulky, but I still play with the bricks - you don't have to be 3 years old to play!

I give this set 5/5 for endless playability and for the fact it was the first set I ever played with! :P
