"BRICK_101","2011-10-08T20:04:12.717Z","Good Simple Fun","I picked up Life of George today and spent a little time this evening 
playing with it. Here's a mini-review:<br><br>Life of George is a game 
that combines physical building with an iPhone app that presents 
building challenges. The clock starts ticking as soon as you see the 
picture of what you need to build, once you are done you use the camera 
to prove you've completed the build. You are scored on both accuracy and
 time of completion. <br><br>I assumed that as an Adult Fan of LEGO I 
would easily get 5 stars on every challenge, assuming it was geared 
towards children with clumsy fingers - not so. I averaged 3 1/2 stars on
 most challenges and only managed to get 5 stars once in my initial 
round of play. I felt the need to keep playing to prove that I could do 
better. <br><br>The graphics and bright, crisp and simple. The music is 
very basic, I doubt many will leave it on. The models are reminiscent of
 8-bit video game graphics, simple but slightly whimsical. <br><br>The 
capture technology is fast and easy, but only if you give it exactly 
what it wants. You must have the play mat and your model oriented in the
 direction the app shows them to you. If you rotate the mat 180 degrees 
it will not register properly. Ditto if you put your creation down 90 
degrees rotated. <br><br>The price is a bit high going by the bricks, 
$30 for 144 bricks plus the playmat, but the main game has 120 
challenges so if you value those similar to bricks then it's about 
right. It will be interesting to see if LEGO offers additional content 
down the road. One feature I'd love to see added is the ability to share
 the models you've created with others. Especially if you could group 
them into custom levels like the real game.",TRUE,4,3,5,5,3

He bought me one set as a souvenir.Really happy to get this since there's no seller here in Indonesia that selling this item.</p><br>For those who still do not know how you play the Life of George :<br>1. You have to own an IPhone/IPod/IPad<br>2. You download the Life of George program from App Store<br>3. The program will give you various shapes of Lego creations (e.g. hula dancer, crab, coconut tree, etc)<br>4. You try to recreate that using your bricks. After you are happy with the result, you put it on the board, take a picture, and the program will give you a score based on your accuracy and the time you take.<br><br>Back to review :<br><br>The set just contains basic bricks. All 144 of them.<br>So you get :<br>Brick 1x1 : @6 pcs (Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, White)<br>Brick 1x2 : @8 pcs (Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, White)<br>Brick 1x3 : @4 pcs (Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, White)<br>Brick 1x4 : @4 pcs (Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, White)<br>Brick 1x6 : @2 pcs (Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, White)<br><p>The only part that unique in this set is the Gameboard to place the finished set and take a picture.</p><p>The game itself is fun. With the various design they have, they can teach you a lot of shapes that you can make just using limited number of regular bricks. Kind of like mozaic style, only not stud up, but from the side. <br></p><p>The major minus point from this set is the price. How come we have to pay Euro 30 for only basic bricks? Way too expensive...</p><p><br></p><p>So, if you really want this set, better start rummaging through your spare bricks collection, and buy the board only. <br></p><p>Or maybe, if you want a cheaper alternative, after you got the bricks, try to find the scanned version of the board, and then print it by yourself. Lots cheaper that way.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Have fun playing Life of George!<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><br>",TRUE,2,1,4,5,1
