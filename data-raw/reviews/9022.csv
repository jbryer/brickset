"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-30T21:56:12.31Z","A joust conclusion to the Kingdoms line.","If, indeed, Kingdoms Joust is intended as a send-off to the Kingdoms line - a prophecy that is probably all but true given the recent confirmation of LEGO Lord of the Rings - then it should be said that this set is a worthy a send-off as any, because Joust will always be remembered (by me, anyway) as the crowning glory of a beloved Castle subtheme.<div><br></div><div>So what exactly is it about Kingdoms that I think made it so good? To me, it was a return to the basics: simple pieces, attractive buildings, and two opposing factions to make wonderful war with. True, the Dragon Knights may have left something to be desired, but the Lion Knights, the proverbial ""good"" faction, more than made up for it. With a castle that&nbsp;hearkened&nbsp;back to the fantastic Black Falcons' Castle (re-released as <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10039-1"">10039</a>) of yore and a clean colour scheme, Kingdoms was an instant sell for me. As far as Joust goes, I really do think that the set contains everything that LEGO Castle stands for: a detailed recreation of medieval life made out of simple pieces and a lot of love.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But enough about that. You want to know if Joust is worth your gold pieces. In summary: I do believe it is. Containing a whopping 1,500+ pieces and 9 Minifigs and a build that will take you a good couple of hours to complete, you can be assured right from the start that you're going to get your money's worth. I could be colossally wrong here, but among the Minifigs, there are two that are of particularly worthy of mention. The first is the Black Falcon Knight, a mysterious opponent noticed by everyone when he was first shown back in October. Sadly, he does not bear the Black Falcon logo on his torso, and I do wish that they had chosen dark blue instead of dark green as his secondary colour, but you do get a couple of newly-designed Black Falcon shields, which are sure to tickle one's nostalgic fancies, assuming one was around when the Black Falcons originally were (and that was a very long sentence, for which I apologise). The second point of interest is the queen, and although she is more or less identical to the Fantasy Era one featured in Drawbridge Defense (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7079-1"">7079</a>; of all places), she is now decked out in Lion Knight red. One final thing to note is that not only do the instructions for this set come in a separate packaging, they are also packed with a backing board so they do not get flattened en route to your house! If this had been my first LEGO set ever, I might have almost been fooled into believing that LEGO was finally taking this issue seriously - although, had this been my first LEGO set ever, I would probably be running around all over the house screaming like a howler monkey.</div><div><br></div><div>Like any set of this magnitude, Joust comes with a number of smaller components to complement the main build, which is, ironically, not the Joust at all. Now, it's probably well known that LEGO has attempted other ""joust"" type sets before (most recently being the somewhat lacking ""Final Joust"" (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7009-1"">7009</a>), which was about as final as <i>Final Fantasy III</i>), but don't be fooled: the jousting scene really is just a small part of this set and allows for a convenient name and nothing more. This is not to say that the joust scene and its accompanying setpieces are bad; far from it. Not is the jousting course extremely loooooong and satisfying, the audience booth for his majesty and the queen is also incredibly detailed and could have easily served as a set all by itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The true build of Joust is the magnificent town gate that serves as the backdrop to the battling knights, and this gate is loaded with so many details that they almost defy a paltry review. Two peasant-like buildings flank the main gate, and their intended function is not immediately clear to me. Houses? Audience stands? Shops? A combination of all the above? However you choose to interpret them, you fill find that they connect to the main gate via Technic-esque pegs, and hinges on the outermost parts of their walls allow them to make whatever (acute) angles you desire.</div><div><br></div><div>And now the main gate. Oh my, the main gate. Standing slightly taller than the previous ship of the line, King's Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7946-1"">7946</a>), there are so many tiny details to the gate that you'd better have a nice rainy afternoon cleared and a fair amount of patience. The left tower features a beautiful curved balcony for some lovely LEGO lady to stand and watch her lover get mangled in the arena, while the right tower is some kind of wedding chapel (???) that features a magnificent stained-glass window and an altar/Booke of Doom of some kind. Flowering vines adorn the outer walls of the gate leading up to the main archway, above which is meant to be some kind of makeshift dwelling place for the royal family.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Honestly, I could go on, but I hope I'm not being corny by saying that building Joust is something that you'd have to experience for yourself. The myriad of tiny details in almost every part of the construction is proof enough that Joust was a work of love, a feather in the Kingdoms cap. I can only hope that this serves a template for Castle lines to come, because if that's the case, it's going to be awesome.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"dylanesque","2012-01-02T08:25:03.413Z","The stage is set.","This set came as a surprise to see but a very pleasant one. Jousting is such integral part of Castle life, yet this magnificent set was some time in coming, although the wait was worth it.<div><br></div><div>The set is big, over 1500 pcs and looks great. It is a worthy stage for the best jousting knights in the land to compete for glory. The large red turrets look particularly good, especially along side of the Kings Castle of this era, also sporting a red turret. I love the little tents for the knights to use for readying themselves for the joust, nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div>The build was very enjoyable and is quite solid with 2+ hours required depending on what speed you like to go at. Some very nice building techniques which as with many recent sets are a marvel to build and learn from.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally to finish on, some good news regarding the Kingdoms subtheme. I have confirmation that despite this years release of LOTR Lego, Kingdoms will continue! Hooray! This info is from a senior lego staff, so not getting false hopes up, it is real! I am really glad because I have thoroughly enjoyed this castle subtheme, one of the best in years. Can't wait to see what new sets there are for this year, but until then this set is a must get and if you can afford it grab 2 as they join together to create a massive joust setting.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading and have fun!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"wunztwice","2012-01-17T16:50:17.557Z","Joust about perfect.","<p>I had the opportunity to pick this set up recently and eagerly did so!&nbsp; The decent price-per-piece was a big draw, as was the great selection of figures.&nbsp; The joust-as-big-event-in-town context was a great idea on LEGO's part.&nbsp; I love the inclusive nature of this set, as it serves to be an arena, addition to castle architecture, and slice of 'Kingdom' life.&nbsp; Bias a I may be for Castle-themed sets, this is really a winner, let's see why:<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- Large parts selection and decent p-p-p.<br></li><li>- Great selection of figures, including the new green-dressed princess and the 'Black Falcon' throwback knight.</li><li>- Large and inclusive play value.&nbsp; There are so many options for play or 'set-up' suggested by this set.</li><li>- Elegant and creative architecture.</li><li>- Room for easy expansion!<br></li><li>- CASTLE!<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- A tad overpriced.&nbsp; The Medieval Market Village (10093) was priced at $100 USD, and contains over 1600 parts.&nbsp; This set was priced at $120 USD, but contains 1575 parts.&nbsp; This is really the biggest drag on this set.&nbsp; I would have preferred a lower price, or perhaps a bit more castle for this same price.<br></li><li>- Before attached the third story/bridge is a bit weak and fragile.&nbsp; This could have easily been fixed with only a few generic plates and is an oversight on the designers' part.</li><li>- While the parts selection is good, it felt like it lacked something when all built.&nbsp; You know that feeling?<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall the set is great, and is a very good addition to any collection.&nbsp; It even makes for a decent parts pack.&nbsp; I would not pass this up if you are a LEGO Castle fan at all.&nbsp; By far this is the best set based around jousting/medieval games, and is ripe for expansion.&nbsp; I can imagine all sorts of extra tents, more wall sections, and even more scenarios to play out with 'setting-up' the figs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks, LEGO, for this winner of a set!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Matt_Z_","2012-02-18T21:01:25.57Z","A Cornerstone for the Record Books","<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 When 10223-1 Kingdoms Joust was first announced, I felt immediately this had the potential to rise above the rest. Being an extremely avid fan of the Castle theme line all my life, I felt it had the air of a &ldquo;must buy&rdquo; classic. I was most certainly not disappointed. The set looks every bit as good in pictures as it does in real life. In time, it is certain to etch its name into the record books as one of the best overall sets ever released. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll run through a review of some pros and cons (subtle cons at that) and finish off with a conclusion.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <b>Pros</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">-</span><span style=""line-height: normal; text-indent: -18pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 7pt;"">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;""><b>The entire set?!</b> : Where to begin? It matters not if you are a long time collector or a child receiving this as your first ever &ldquo;big&rdquo; set. The feeling evoked within you should be roughly the same. As a kid, you&rsquo;ll remember this set for its size, colour, shape, creativity and playability. As a grown up, you&rsquo;ll remember this set for all the above, and you&rsquo;ll appreciate the detail that TLG has put into the construction of this set. To sit here and begin to describe every last detail of the set would STILL not do it justice. I will simply say that it&rsquo;s a build you&rsquo;d have to experience firsthand to fully and whole-heartedly grasp. All nine minifigures in this set are unique and enjoyable in their own right, whether it be their design, rarity, colour scheme, or general relevance within the set. Each has a role and each has tremendous value. The set has a wide array of interesting elements and parts, be it the bread loaf, the cherries, the black falcon elements, the shields, the golden cup/plate, the horse armour, and more. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 The playability of this set is not up for debate. There is no lack of scenarios you could create with a joust scene, royalty, and others. Furthermore, if you have a castle setup, this set instantly becomes a focal point of your collection. Entire villages/castle/etc. &nbsp;could feasibly be built around this set. It provides the inspiration needed to branch out and recreate the rest of the jousting arena and more- which is more than many sets can claim. In all honesty, this set is a must-have and cornerstone of not just castle fans, but LEGO fans alike.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <b>Cons</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">- As always, sets of this calibre will keep you humble by demanding a lot of your gold (money). At the current $149.99 CDN price tag, I feel as though some people will shy away and look longingly at this set, as it fades out of production and into the record books. But if I say it once, I&rsquo;ll say it a thousand times: Don&rsquo;t let that person be you! I can&rsquo;t stress enough how, at this current rate and in this current time, this sets value will only go up as the years go by. It&rsquo;s the kind of set that people will say &ldquo;Gee, I wish I had the opportunity to buy it back then&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish I was around when this set came out!&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t let yourself be the one that says &ldquo;I wish I didn&rsquo;t let this one get away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""text-indent: -18pt;""><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
 <span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">For my 10223-1 Kingdoms Joust review, I strayed from my typical rubric of analyzing the every detail of the set and (for better or worse) have tried to emphasize the fact that this set should be top priority for many Lego fans of all ages, while it&rsquo;s available this year. The magic is in experiencing this build and playability at any age, from child to adult. It&rsquo;s just one of those sets that can&rsquo;t possibly lose value over time. And that right there signifies an instant classic.</span></p>

"aplbomr79","2012-01-08T02:40:37.183Z","Joust what the Kingdoms line needed...","<p>This is an incredible centerpiece for the Kingdoms line of LEGO Castle. &nbsp;Just as the Fantasy Era was capped off by the quintessential Medieval Market Village, the Kingdoms Joust puts a very attractive feather into the cap of a line that was on the verge of slipping into obscurity. &nbsp;My only complaint is that it comes at a very questionable time for Kingdoms. &nbsp;Facing a draw-down, or even a total retirement of the Kingdoms theme, TLG released what may be one of the greatest Castle sets of all time. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>There is little to say in tune with the box and instructions. &nbsp;Both elements are in line with the way that TLG packages its sets. &nbsp;There is no complaints on the snapshots on the back of the box, and I still appreciate the 'Minifig Line-up' on the side panel.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Although there is no new parts to speak of, there are some pieces that have new printing (see Minifigures). &nbsp;TLG designers did their best with the pieces included, and that is evident in the build and the final showcase. But with 1500+ pieces in the arsenal, there are some great pieces to speak of. &nbsp;Some of these are:</div><div>-1x2 Modified Brick with slot - in Sand Blue! (14)</div><div>-Brown Frogs (4)</div><div>-Bottles (2)</div><div>-Bardings (2) - both that are unique to this set.</div><div>-Book (1)</div><div>-Pitchfork (1)</div><div>-Red Cape (1)</div><div>-Shields (8) - 8 Shields in one set? &nbsp;Awesome. &nbsp;Plus, there are 3 new Falcon Shields!</div><div>...There are some other quasi-rare pieces.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigs alone will make this set a collector's item forever. &nbsp;There are 9 minifigs included in the set. &nbsp;Beyond the (2) common Lion Knights there are 7 other fairly unique Minifigs.</p><p>-Lion King (1) &nbsp;This is the same King found in King's Carriage Ambush (7188).</p><p>-Lion Queen (1) &nbsp;This Queen is unique to this set. &nbsp;It is similar to the Queen found in the Kingdoms Advent Calendar (2010).</p><p>-Nobleman (1) This is the only Nobleman that TLG has ever released - as far as I know. &nbsp;I can imagine his value will greatly increase over time.</p><p>-Young Squire (1) &nbsp;Another unique Minifig to this set - although there are no unique pieces.</p><p>-Lion Knight (1) The armor, and torso make this minifig unique to this set. &nbsp;Even though similar Lion Knights have been released, due to this being a part of the Joust - this Minifig will command a substantial value.</p><p>**Falcon Knight** &nbsp;This may be one of the most unique Minifigs that TLG has ever released; this is due to the attachment of the Minifig to the Green Dragons AND the legendary Black Falcons. &nbsp;The Minifig is painted in the same colors as the Green Dragon and is released in the Kingdoms line (a line that has only included the Lion Knights and the Green Dragons). &nbsp;However, the&nbsp;armament of this Knight is nondescript; it does not lend itself to the Green Dragons or any other line of warriors -including the Black Falcons. &nbsp;The only items that attach the Falcon Knight to the Black Falcons is the Falcon Shields - but even though they are similar in design, they do not adorn the Blue or Yellow coloring that the Black Falcon shields had.</p><p>#I am very pleased that this set harkens back to the Black Falcons - but does not attach this Knight to the Black Falcons. &nbsp;It is a nod to the legendary Black Falcons, but allows the Knight to be the 'Champion' of the Green Dragons. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build starts off with the actual 'Joust' setting. &nbsp;The two Knights, their barded Horses, their equipment, and the Joust Line (repetitive) are built in this phase. &nbsp;The Knight's tents are also included in this build - and are as pleasing to the eye as they are to build, and they are NOT identical. &nbsp;The tents are remain true (in color scheme) to the Lion Knight faction and the Green Dragon Faction. &nbsp;The final products are great.</p><p>The Grandstand build was next. &nbsp;When I started to build, I was worried about the integrity of the structure - but after I was finished, was was not disappointed. &nbsp;The Grandstand looks incredible and offers up a very satisfying build.</p><p>The Squires Wall was the third component. &nbsp;The wall portion was a little repetitive to build but after this, was exceptional. &nbsp;The outer-portions are&nbsp;articulated allowing for add-ons and set up.&nbsp;The final product is great - however I wish that TLG would have included a Falcon Knight flagset (in case the Falcon wins); the squire just seems one-sided leaning to a feeling that the Joust may be fixed. ;)</p><p>The Nobles Wall was next to build and was quite a treat working with all of those Sand-Blue colored bricks. &nbsp;Again, the outer sides are articulated so it lends to balance and the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;of attaching more components later. &nbsp;The roof is hinged to allow access into the upper portion of the building.</p><p>The Tower Entrance was the most intense portion of the build. &nbsp;The towers are similar, but are not symmetrical - and that is the most pleasing part. &nbsp;Even though some portions of the build seem repetitive, they are different in nature. &nbsp;The actual build does not include a gate - but LEGO has incorporated pieces to allow for a gate to be secured to the structure. &nbsp;The Entrance is actually 4 different builds - the 2 towers, the Bridge, and the Roof.</p><p>Allow at least 2 hours of build time to complete this set. &nbsp;I loved every moment of it - and am looking forward to building this set again (seeing that I have the funds to purchase another set).</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is everything I imagined it to be. &nbsp;It looks incredible - and the more you set your eyes to it - the more things you find to appreciate. &nbsp;Again, I would compare this to MMV in terms of beauty - and that is saying a lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Summary</span></p><p>I am hesitant to claim this to be the greatest 'Castle' set of all time - but it definitely is in the running. &nbsp;Beyond this, the Kingdom's Joust will not stand in any other set's shadow. &nbsp;It is a great build, has great Minifigs, and has unlimited playability by it's own right. &nbsp;However, when this set is included into a Castle setting, it will really shine - especially when it is incorporated into a setting that includes the Kingdom's King's Castle and the Medieval Market Village. &nbsp;The only thing that I would ask for is two Squires - one for each battling Knight. &nbsp;But I can take care of that on my own...</p><p>---</p><p>Only time will tell if collectors will include this set into the heralded realm that already boasts the Original 'Yellow Castle', King's Castle, Guarded Inn, Black Falcon's Fortress, Black Monarch's Castle, Blacksmiths Shop, etc. &nbsp;My bet is that this will be one of the most adored Castle sets of all time.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Building is a great experience, lots of great parts including several new ones and great ways how older parts are used. The 9 minifigures are beautyfull, the return of the Black Falcon Knight is surprising but a great invention. The result when finished is spectacular, for now the Crown on the Kingdoms theme ! The price (in Holland &euro;130,00) is huge too but you forget it when building it and look at the result. If you can afford it a must for the Castle fan. It is already qualified as exclusive and definitely&nbsp;deserves that name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building 5 bricks : Building it is great like in the old days, no big panels just small bricks. The set is too big to describe it all. I just am going to mention some parts I liked.</p>

<ul>
	<li>1. The tournament part: The long fence is very good and of course the Black Falcon Knight. The 2 small weapon tents are lovely and built differently, no mirror building with other colors.</li>
	<li>2.

A wonderfull Royal stand with great details like the fruit scale and a&nbsp;wonderful King and Queen. Missing are the chairs, nothing is perfect.</li>
	<li>3. The Squires hideout: a stone wall with a lovely wooden building probably to take care of the horses with a cute small minifigure with bucket and pitchfork; the Young Squire.</li>
	<li>4. The rest Room ?: another stone wall with a nice colored blue/gray building, maybe a Knights restroom with another great minifigure; the Nobleman. Missing an interior in the room.</li>
	<li>5. Left entrance Tower: wonderful built tower with 3/4 of the wooden entrance bow and a guard. Nice details are the green leafs with flowers, the wooden fence on the first floor&nbsp;and a great design with the bow also on the first floor.</li>
	<li>6. Right entrance Tower: The mirrored built of 5 with also nice details. Great is the red/yellow window on the first floor, simply yet beautiful. Again leafs with flowers and some nice dark gray accents used. Also a Knight standing guard.</li>
	<li>7. Second floor and gate passing: a great little building with a lot of lot of grey studs as small pillars. The walls on the side towers can be opened with hinges. Nice interiors in both side rooms and another great minifigure; the Green Princess.</li>
	<li>8. The Tower roofs: Great looking red roofs built with both normal and high slope pieces give the set a great finish. Very well studded with several bricks within the towers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall a great result which you can show on a straight line and a bit closed again thanks to the use of some hinges.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts 5 bricks: Impossible to name all the great parts used&nbsp;in this set, I&#39;ll try some: the big white and red slopes, brown frogs, the pitchfork, Black Falcon Knight with shields and horse blanket and so on. All parts can be used to make great creations and MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability 5 bricks: no need to explain it in my opinion. Combined with other Kingdoms sets even an AFOL wil start playing with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value&nbsp;5 bricks: I almost distracted 1 brick here simply because &euro;130,00 is a lot of money, even for a great set like this. But is it worth it ? Yes, I got it as a birthday gift but I would have bought anyway simply because it is worth every cent you pay for it.&nbsp;</p>

In other words, you don't need me to tell you how great it is.

Not only does it include the obligatory charging horses and gate, but it also comes with a platform for the king and queen and two impressive towers that overlook the festive scene. The platform includes a canopy on top, and a plate of berries and a bottle positioned on either side of the royal couple. The king and queen, by the way, are all new minifigures. Connected to the side of the left tower (the position really depends on how you arrange it) is a ""wooden"" stage, from where the peasants can watch the joust. On the side of the right tower is a blue cabin whose interior is somewhat lacking, but can be used to house another bottle and possibly a loaf of bread.&nbsp;</p><p>Both towers are divided into three floors. The first floors are tiled. The second floor of the left tower has a brown cabinet/dresser and a balcony for the princess to stand on.

The left tower floor has a cabinet with some form of potions or perfumes located within it. The right tower includes a uniquely designed table that has brown frogs serving as its legs. Intriguing, no? So, if you're thoroughly convinced that this a lego for you, then go out and buy it.

"Fauch","2015-02-18T18:03:58.357Z","Great display","<p>Parts</p>

<p>Really not that much impressed by the parts in this. It is mostly small pieces (the fact that King&#39;s castle, which is 600 pieces smaller, is apparently heavier should be a big hint). Well, it has a lots of red slopes, a decent number of diagonal pieces and arches, lots of flags coming in 4 different colors, several shields, cherries, flowers in 3 different colors (and quite a lot of them), log bricks in 3 different colors as well, frogs in 2 different colors, including rare brown ones, two printed tiles, one with a map and one with a boat. The pieces that stood out the most were sand blue bricks with groove. Of course that&#39;s far from nothing, but if you take into account that this set has 1500 pieces, I feel that the overall selection of pieces is not so special.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s probably no surprise, minifigures are great, they all have backprinting (even under armours, some have double sided face, the prints are really detailed and intricate (look at the princess, just great), they also come with some nice accessories, bread, pitchfork, 2 different crowns... The drawback is that slope pieces that stand for robes still has no back or side printing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a build that relies relatively little on advanced technics, but still isn&#39;t that easy. Actually, most of the modules are quite flimsy until you put a roof on them, and you have a lot of 1x1 tiles to correctly align, so you should be cautious when building this model. The 3rd floor of the castle in particular is very big and flimsy, though maybe not that much if you directly build it on top of the rest of the castle, but instructions suggest to build it separately, which proves to not be that easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is totally massive, taking like half a table, something like 70 x 50 cm and about 30 cm high.</p>

<p>Even the small house and the stables on the sides are already a very respectable size, and could be medium sized sets just by themselves.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great display piece, playability comes mostly from all those minifigs, horses and accessories. The wide variety of figs is a plus, though there is only one enemy soldier.&nbsp;There are absolutely no gimmicks like trap doors or exploding walls, which makes this set a bit less fun, and probably less appealing to children. The price of 120&euro; may seem cheap if you look at the number of pieces, but not so much if you look at&nbsp;the weight, though for what you get, it&#39;s not overpriced.</p>
