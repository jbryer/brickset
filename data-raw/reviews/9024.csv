I have to say, that is pretty cheap for a good book and for a good figure.&nbsp;<div>To start of the Lego Star Wars Character&nbsp;Encyclopedia is about all the Lego Star Wars figures to date. It starts off with all the minifigures from Episode I, then II, then III and so on. Then after episode VI, it does the Clone Wars and Expanded Universe. It does figures like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, W.Wald and a ton other figures.&nbsp;</div><div>The&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;figure you get with this book is Han Solo with his medal of honor. This figure is a really nice edition to your minifigure collection. He has the print of the current Han Solo from the 7965&nbsp;Millennium Falcon, only that he has a medal print and dark blue legs.</div><div>If you ever see this book I would recommend getting it! &nbsp;</div>",FALSE,3,1,1,1,5
"alva","2011-11-07T01:20:23.917Z","A Book for Lego Star Wars Fans","Got this book last month from amazon.com but had no chance to read it until now.<br>Really nice and detailed book, dedicated for Star Wars Minifigs. Although not all Lego Star Wars minifigs included in this book, but the content of the book is quite complete, from the year one of Lego Star Wars til 2011.<br>The book is divided into a couple of chapters, following the Star Wars movies, so you got minifigs from episodes 1 to 6 and then Clone Wars and Extended Universe. <br>Each pages will consist of a minifigs, some background story of who he is, some old version of it and some sets that he showed up.<br><br>One thing that you will realize when you receive your book is the size. I expect that this book size will be similar with Lego Star Wars Visual Dictionary or Lego Idea Book, but turn out the size is much smaller, around half size roughly. If you display it in your bookcase (that's what I do) the book look dwarfed by other Lego related books published by DK, but if you want to carry it around, this new size is much better cause you can put it in your back easily.<br><br>For you guys Star Wars fans, the extra minifig of Han Solo in his Yavin Celebration suit is enough reason to buy the book. A perfect match for the Luke Skywalker Minifig you got from Lego Star Wars Visual Dictionary book. Although if you notice more, you will find that this Han Solo minifig is the same quality as the quality of Minifig Collections Series. Probably Lego decided to cut cost and made him in China? Oh well, a limited edition is a limited edition, so no matter what, just grab one then. And if you are like me, you probably wont open the minifig at all.<br><br>",TRUE,5,3,1,1,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-23T16:05:15.29Z","A Galaxy of Mini-Figs at your Fingertips","<p>Set #500214 LEGO Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Right off the bat I'll say this, if you are NOT A LEGO Star Wars fan this item is not for you. If You are a LEGO Mini-Figure Fan, this product is definitely for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>208 Pages of Mini-Figure images, including facts, data and images of every single LEGO Star Wars Mini-Figure from 1999 to the present. Or at least that's what LEGO's selling point is for this, it is possible that not all of the variants of certain Mini-Figs are represented in this book. I'm not exactly an expert on that front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This product is a great read, and the value for its money is also pretty high, but that could be because I bought it for 11 dollars Canadian at Costco. Included with this book is a LEGO Yavin Ceremony Han Solo Mini-Fig, with the release of the new Y-Wing and Ceremonial Leia we will have all three of them from that scene at the end of ANH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that this product is a must-own&nbsp;book for the LEGO Star Wars fan and the LEGO Star Wars Mini-Figure fan, a great thing about this book as well is its size. All of the other DK LEGO Books are pretty large, the dimensions of this book are much better for your book shelf and it is also easier on the hands when holding it to read. I hope that LEGO will continue all future collaborations with DK Publishing in this size, and that they'll make similar books to this one for other Themes. A Dedicated LEGO City/Town Mini-Fig Encyclopedia would make a great new product. Like all Bonus Mini-Figures Han is made in China, but don't let that stop you from owning this handy little reference guide for when you're away from your computer and Brickset's site.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5

<p>The Lego star wars characters and creatures is a book with a cool figure but outdated information .</p>

<p>The book-</p>

<p>The figure has the ugly old han solo hair , a good face print and good torso and legs . The book is only up to 2011 so it is now 9 years out of date .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I can only recommend it for the han figure and nothing else .</p>
