"alva","2011-10-19T23:05:17.593Z","Great Lego Idea Book","Before this book available, the only idea book that I have is the 260-Idea Book item, launched on 1990. After that, only one idea book launched, the 697-Building Ideas Book on 1997. I think Lego should really consider to launch this kind of book annually, instead of launching some sticker books, activity books, etc. The idea book is really in line with the spirit of building. <br><br>Regarding this book :<br>This book contains a couple of chapter, based on the category of the creation :<br>Chapter 1 : Transport (cars, boats, planes, air balloon, etc)<br>Chapter 2 : Town and Country (house, furniture, farm, bridge, etc)<br>Chapter 3 : Space (space ship, alien ship, etc)<br>Chapter 4 : Middle Age (castle, catapult, wagon, etc)<br>Chapter 5 : Adventure (pirates, vikings, jungle, etc)<br>Chapter 6 : Handy Accessories (pen holder, photo frame, chess, etc)<br><br>Each chapter is done by a different builder, and on each chapter's end, you can read a short interview with them.<br><br>Like the titled said, Idea Book, the publisher expect that after reading the book, you can get some new and fresh ideas to build something out of your imagination. So this book DOESN'T include step-by-step instruction. You only can see the final result and there will be a short review with main technique that used to build the MOC. <br><br>Each pictures in this books are superb. Crisp and bright.<br><br>I really love each ideas of the book. Really amaze me how people can come up with so many possibility to do MOC. And I think every MOCer should have this book, just in case one day you stuck with no idea, you can screen through this book and find something that can spark up your creativity!<br><br>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
"Gandalf1","2012-03-22T10:34:30.337Z","Let's build something!","<p>The building experience, parts, and playability of the book are nonexistent, that's why they are rated 1.</p><p><br></p><p>My younger brother received this book for Christmas (2011) with instructions on the tag to share it with his siblings. I don't think he has gotten a whole lot out of it, but I know I have!</p><p>Okay, this book is awesome. It gives you tons of ideas for LEGO models that you can make. It is divided into sections, such as ""Out of this World"" and ""Practical Building"". A page will usually have a description of the model they're showing, and if there's a minifigure on or near the model, they'll probably have speech bubble saying something funny, such as on the pizza-delivery space ship, when the delivery guy says, ""Garunteed delivery in 20 light-years or less!"" Although I may point out that light-years are a measure of distance, not time, but they probably knew that. <i><b>Anyway</b></i>, they usually have an alternate version of part of the model, to inspire you even if you don't have the right pieces for the main one, for example, on the tractor model, they have the green Exo-Force hair pieces used for cabbage. It tells you that instead of cabbages, you can use two flower stalks and a yellow 1x1 round brick to make a corn stalk.</p><p>At the end of each section, there's a part called ""Meet the Builder"". This is about four pages including an interview with whoever designed all the models for that section. They ask things like, ""How many LEGO bricks do you own?"" and ""What would you do if you had all the LEGO bricks (and time!) you want?"" Each builder has a picture, but it isn't a photo of them, it's a photo of their custom minifigure!""</p><p>So, this book is very good, and if you want LEGO inspiration on a wide variety of themes, this is the book for you!</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,1,3

"J14T14","2018-10-12T00:32:38.287Z","My First, and Favorite, LEGO Book","<p>I bought this book at a School book fare&nbsp;and it changed how I looked at LEGO forever. That may be quite a bold claim to make over a children&#39;s&nbsp;book, but it is true.</p>

<p>I got this book right before I went into my dark ages. I read through it before then and I was inspired to build some creations, even recreating some of the smaller builds with my own pieces. I fell into my dark ages from about 2011 to 2014. Once I came out of that, I took another look at this book and I was really&nbsp;inspired. I no longer built things using random colors, I planed my builds and tried to make them look as nice as the models in the book. There are several sections in the book going over vehicles, space, houses, and real world objects. The builds in the book are build by real fans and the chapters are the creators explaining the theme of the chapter and the builds. The section going over castles was my favorite and I even build a couple of castles with my own parts using some of the techniques shown in the book.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great book! I believe that it is still being sold as I recently saw it in the background of a documentary&nbsp;going over the LEGO house. If you do find it, I recommend&nbsp;that you get it. It is truly&nbsp;inspiring and it is a great thing to have.</p>
