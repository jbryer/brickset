"Irene","2013-03-04T09:25:05.82Z","Good set.  ","<p>This set has 20 pieces as it was bagged at the Lego store. </p>
<p>As I am an adult,&nbsp;I had&nbsp;to wait until after the build date, and&nbsp;ask for a set. Luckily there were some left over. </p>
<p>There were no instructions on the day that I picked it up, but it was easy to build by duplicating the set that was on display.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The instructions, as on line, are for a set with 28 pieces.&nbsp; Most notably, the house is no longer a cylinder, but is made of a 1x1 brick (lantern) that gets 4 1x1 tiles.&nbsp; In the instructions there are also a few more clear dots, and the Light house lamp is different.</p>
<p>This set is a&nbsp;very tiny scale. It is more a display, than a play piece.&nbsp; No minifigure would ever fit inside, and it is even smaller than most mini-size&nbsp;city&nbsp;displays. </p>
