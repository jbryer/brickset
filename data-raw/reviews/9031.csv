When rookie Dan Rocka goes on an unapproved rescue mission, a strange being makes dog-like creatures attack him. Meanwhile, Heroes Duncan Bulk, Jimi Stringer, Julius Nex, and Will Furno play some kind of ball game. Afterwards, Alpha Team leader Preston Stormer brings the Heroes to a briefing room, where Zib gives them their latest mission: rescue Rocka. The Heroes are given animal powers and weapons. They go to the planet Quatros to rescue Rocka and battle through the animals under Aldous Witch, better known as the Witch Doctor, to stop the villains from taking the Quaza, because if they take all the Quaza, Quatros will break apart.<br>It also includes the episode <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ordeal of Fire</span>, in which the Heroes fight the evil Fire Villains and recive the Upgrade. All in all, get this DVD!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
