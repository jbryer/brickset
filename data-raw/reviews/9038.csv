","This is a excellent well thought out set, similar in a few ways to 8285, as a american style truck, the technical side of the build is well thought out as the power functions motor works through a gearbox, similar to that in set no 8070(supercar) the crane itself is more than adequate for the one small log that comes with it.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"eilon","2012-03-04T03:13:10.053Z","Good pieces, great build, but not fun to play with","<p>I buy almost any Technic set that's over 1,000 pieces, and I was eagerly awaiting this set to be released. I picked it up this morning from my local Lego store and started assembling. There were a few parts that I hadn't seen yet, the most interesting of which was the mini turntable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the build itself was mostly fun, the playability is severely lacking in this set. The build had a lot of points where you had to keep placing pieces in awkward ways where you'd have to slide axles around and temporarily move things out of the way. I'm sure Lego could have come up with better instructions if they had tried.</p><p>Another oddity is that on one step the instructions have weird arrows comparing two types of ""coat hanger"" shaped pieces, though the set comes with only one of them. It doesn't state <em>why</em> the two pieces are being compared. Perhaps it's in case your Lego pieces are in a jumble with other sets and they want to make sure you pick up the right part? But if that's the case, then the new part should not have been introduced - it doesn't seem necessary.</p><p>The playability is quite bad: The hood of the truck tilts open, but just ""plops"" into the ground. The hood isn't supported, as it is in most Technic truck sets with a movable hood or cab. The stabilizers are motor-driven, which is nice, but don't even support the truck. The crane arm works well in terms of articulation, but has no reach at all. It can't reach out far enough to grab a log unless it's right near the truck, and what's worse, the arm can't reach <em>near</em> enough in order to drop it <em>in</em> the truck properly either! And finally, there's only one log! There should be a whole forest of logs!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of pieces!</li><li>New mini turntable</li><li>Power functions sets are almost always cool - it never hurts to have another motor</li><li>The ""gear box"" for the four functions is super fun to build</li><li>The truck doors open</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Awkward build steps at a few points</li><li>Truck hood ""plops"" open instead of being supported</li><li>Stabilizer doesn't really stabilize</li><li>Crane arm doesn't reach out far enough to grab logs or reach near enough to drop them in the truck</li><li>Battery box isn't easily removable (you have to disassemble a part of the truck to remove it)</li><li>Only one log! What a lonely forest that log must come from!</li><li>The ""grabber"" and the ""wrist"" of the crane arm are manually operated (which is OK), but are very flimsy</li></ul>
<p>This is a great set if you want a very cool <em>looking</em> truck, but only a so-so set if you want a cool <em>functioning</em> set. It's a shame that you'll enjoy <em>building</em> the set and then not enjoy <em>playing</em> with it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,5,2,3
"MarkMilton","2012-03-30T00:46:54.423Z","Pretty Damn Good.","I didn't start building Lego sets (let alone, Technic) till about this time last year. &nbsp; Looking over all the past Technic sets, several of them stood out as ones I really regret missing out on: &nbsp;the somewhat legendary #8285 and #8258. &nbsp; With this year's releases, it seemed as if Lego was granting me a second chance with #9395 and this wonderful set!<div><br></div><div>While the new tow-truck is only a shadow of #8285, &nbsp;this new logging truck looked nearly as impressive as the one from a few years ago, so i just HAD to have it.</div><div><br></div><div>The biggest positive to this set was the price, honestly. &nbsp;This hobby isn't cheap, so it's always a HUGE bonus if you find sets that reasonably priced. &nbsp;While it's a shade over 10-cents per piece, this set is motorized, and from what i can see you get a lot of useful gears for those just looking for the parts... &nbsp;so the $139.99 MSRP (i think) is justified.</div><div><br></div><div>The build took me about... &nbsp;6, or maybe 7 hours, &nbsp;but there wasn't much repetition. &nbsp;In fact, early on, I was getting a little bit confused as to what all the gears were going to be doing in the final model. &nbsp; And since it did keep me guessing for a bit, I'd say that the build was better than most.</div><div><br></div><div>The end product is very large (and pretty heavy with the batteries in), and has a lot of playability. &nbsp;The detailing on the set isn't as good as, say, the Flat-bed truck, but the cab area looks good, though the back-end looks a bit skeletal. &nbsp;The claw-crane works great, though I would have liked to somehow not have to manually open/close the claw itself. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The biggest negatives I have with the set is that the crane doesn't fold away at all... I mean it ALWAYS looks like it's ready to operate, instead of compacted for travel. &nbsp; I wished the rear wheels were doubled as well. &nbsp;And I thought the engine looked WAY too small (though, the slim design was necessary for the hood to open and close).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Overall though, I love this set! &nbsp; &nbsp; I know it may not be as great as #8285, but for people like me that missed that one, it's a great second chance.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Note: &nbsp;Though I haven't built it, I want to also give this set props for having a B-Model that looks pretty great in and of itself. &nbsp; Nice!</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5
"Star68","2012-11-15T18:41:31.237Z","After some modding a satisfying truck!","<p>I always wanted a truck like this so this piece was a almost a no-brainer. The build is nice and quick with not much hard solving, except for few awkward steps in the manual which I recommend doing on your own (more logical).&nbsp;I pretty much agree with the eilon's review so I won't go into too much details.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to say I was a little surprised when I discovered the truck has only I-4 engine. Had to implement a V8 (and modify the hood) and add 4 more rear wheels to have 2 rows total.&nbsp;Spent&nbsp;almost the same time modding the whole truck to my liking as with the build.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this truck serves as a basic but also a very good base for your experiments with making it the greatest truck you like!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,2,3
"kavring","2013-02-09T16:26:47.52Z","The B-model is excellent!","<div>Since everybody has been writing reviews of the A-model, without having built the B-model, I thought I'd review that. Please keep in mind that this was my first new set as an adult, so it was the first time I built with studless beams. The only other new set I have to compare with is 8070 Super Car, which I bought just after. I hae built a lot of complex sets in my youth, some 15 years ago.</div><div><br></div><div>I picked this set up for 800NOK, it retails for 1200NOK. I consider the full retail price to be expensive, while at my discounted price it is good value for the money.</div><div><br></div><div>Personally I think the A-model is pretty poor, and it is the crane that ruins it.&nbsp;</div><div>While the build is good, it is not very advanced when comparing it to 8070. Lack of double tires and differential in the rear axle are the biggest flaws.</div><div>The playability is almost nonexistant. The crane has powered rotation and extention, and a manual claw. Controlling the crane is very hard and non-intuitive, as you have to flip the polarity switch on the battery box to correct your errors. It has poor reach and does not stow away at all. Picking up the log is a pain, and it does not look realistic at all while doing it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The B-model is awesome.</div><div>It is a European cab-over style truck, with a snow plow.</div><div>Only real drawback to this model is the lack of double tires, and the I4 engine instead of I6 which is common.&nbsp;</div><div>Powered functions are: Snow plow up/down, Bed up/down. Cab tilt forward/backward (for engine service), and lift axle up/down.</div><div>I like the realism of this model and the powered functions, especially with the lift axle which is essential when driving in (and clearing) snow.</div><div>The controls are also much easier to operate than on the A-model, and they look more natural.</div><div>The finish isnt as smooth as the 8109 Flatbed Truck, but it is still good.</div><div><br></div><div>The building experience is pretty similar to the A-model, gearbox is very similar. The instructions are easy to follow; I use a tablet for electronic instructions, which is very convenient compared to using a pc.</div><div>Either if you are building this for play or display, you should definitely opt for the B-model!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"kaans","2013-08-16T21:44:56.26Z","Model B","As the model function is similar to Unimog's I decided to build model B<br><br>The first thing you notice is that the bag/piece placements are really confusing, normally you could guess the bag a piece would be in, however for this set this was not the case.<br><br>I don't pour the pieces into a pile before building, rather get them from bags, almost always you feel the optimization of piece/bags, but this set just kept annoying me.<br><br>If I had to do it all over again, I might have built the model A, building from an ipad wasn't too fun<br><br>In the end, model B looks and functions great, It's extremely sturdy, much better looking than model A imo<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
