<p>This is going to sound harsh, but I want all to know that this pains me as a fan and parent and is unfortunately a disappointing experience (the Bricktober set in general)</p>
<p>I gotta say the gluing of minis to magnet bases was a very poor decision and one that makes no logical sense to me as the point of LEGO is to mix and match and build and...well...anything SHORT of having parts glued together for the sake of non-playability.</p>
<p>I'll start with something I've never done: (nor felt I had the need to do)&nbsp; Explain my ratings.</p>
<p>Building Experience - 1 - there is nothing to build here.&nbsp; It's pretty much&nbsp;pre-built minus maybe putting the ninja hood on the character.</p>
<p>Parts - 2 - the only&nbsp; really useable parts are the detachable head, hood, Bricktober label piece.&nbsp; So unless you want to switch out a face...</p>
<p>Playability - Uno - it's basically a magnet.&nbsp; And unlike many other magnets, they didn't even attempt to compensate the stuck-on-base with an accessory like a sword (which the ninja hood is molded to sheath) - it's a very dry figure.</p>
<p>Value for Moolah -&nbsp;2 - I rated this low due to the fact that while it *is* free, you need to buy $20 of LEGO to get your hands on it - providing the people at TRU have any left or can find them.&nbsp; Overall, not the best experience.</p>
<p>Overall - 1.5, but I was kind and rounded up to 2.</p>
<p>About the only pros I can find for this is the nicely printed Ninja Princess face and the fact that my son likes magnets (he's 6) but even so, I saw his demeanor drop when I explained that they could not be removed from the base.&nbsp; I'm really not quite sure why LEGO does this with ALL their magnets now.&nbsp; It really makes them un-fun for a lack of better term.&nbsp; I know how Lucas operates having known them on a professional level and to demand that for their product is fine if that is what they wish, but to make&nbsp;a decision&nbsp;and have it affect the rest of the magnet line? Absurd!&nbsp; It's a disappointment to fans and children alike and makes no logical sense.</p>
<p>Top that with the inability to find a TRU store that has a clue or has them in stock doesn't help.&nbsp; If you are a fan of retro minis and enjoy decorative magnets then this is ok, but essentially you are paying $20 for a magnet with 3 removable parts and no additional accessories.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,1,2
