"Dodge","2011-11-02T14:58:46.667Z","Best of the month... but misleading.","<p>I was VERY excited to see this years line-up for the Bricktober magnets!&nbsp; The classic Castle fig was very cool, but the Classic black Spaceman too kthe cake for me!&nbsp; I could hardly wait until the last week to pick him up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew well in advance that the magnets are now being glued to the bases, so I had no issue with that.&nbsp; Below is my process upon opening the bag:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""The picture on the bag shows a complete space fig as they should be.&nbsp; Go ahead, take a look... legs, torso with logo, smiling face, tanks on the back, classic helem... wait a second!&nbsp; That's not a classic space helmet on his head at all!&nbsp; The tile on the front states that the fig is from 1984, but that style of helmet did not some out until 1987!&nbsp; What's up with that!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well.&nbsp; I'll open it up anyway [rip] and enjoy the fig as it... hold the phone!&nbsp; There's no tanks on the back of this figure!&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;it must have fallen off and are in the bag... wait... no... no, it's not in there at all!&nbsp; Well, colour me disappointed!""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A classic figure?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; A complete figure?&nbsp; Not so much.&nbsp; I added a tank from my own collection, but really, I shouldn't have had to.&nbsp; It was nice to get it free, but hoepfully those done in the future will be more accurate.</p>",TRUE,3,2,4,3,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;There are two elements that are exclusive to this set. Not as good as it sounds. The first is the 2x4 printed tile. The second is the magnet with the minifig torso and legs glued to it. That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a magnet with four studs on it, and Minifig legs and torso glued to it. Wish I had known that before I bought it. The only other parts are the black helmet and the smiley head. No oxygen tanks. An error at the factory I suppose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;Did they have to be glued like that? No. So would I recommend it? No. Although it is pretty cute.</p>
