I really like the forrest/ranger/southern theme used in the new police series, and plan to collect them all, but this set really attracted my me, mostly because of the garage/shed built into a mountainside.</p><p>However, I was slightly dissapointed.<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>First of, though, the instructions are very good. Finally The LEGO Group has updated the colours in the instructions, so that you can clearly distinguish between black and dark grey! Also, the drawing (probably a 3D-model) of the minifig-radio has been fixed. <br>The building instructions are better structured than I've seen before - you are building from one end of the model to the other, rather than building vertical layers - it certainly helps me keep track of the build.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some new and interessting parts, first of all the bear, which is quite impressive. There is also the new ""brick""-bricks, 1x2 bricks that looks like smaller bricks - used to build the chimney and part of the foundation - I like that new brick!<br>Unfortunately the mountain is mostly build from the large rock-piece-panel introduced a few years ago - I was really hoping for a lot of different angled slopes.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are great! Two cops and two robbers. One of the robbers is an old known one - the prison escapee with a jacket over his prison clothes - the other one is brand new with red sideburns, a cap, and a pair of overalls trying to cover the prison clothes. The two policemen are the new ranger-type, and they look brilliant!<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very easy - the age-range is 5-12, and the bricks are sorted in four different bags, where two would have been enough for most semi-experienced builders.</p><p>There are a lot of different colors used inside the models - this makes it very easy to build the police-car, because you rarely confuse a 2x4 with a 2x3 when one is red and the other one is green. Unfortunately it also makes for some strangely colored interior of the car - I like models where there is actually something resembling an engine inside the car, eventhough you can't see it when the model is finished. Not so here.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The cars look great - even though they are built from ""crazy colours"" on the inside. The shack actually only looks good from one angle - the one used on the box.</p><p>I don't play a lot with my LEGO, but I was still a little dissapointed by the playability in this set. The 4441 Dog Patrol seems to give almost more playability, and for a better price.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all - the cars and the minifigs look great! The shack isn't as great as it seems on the box, and I am a bit dissapointed by the hollow mountain-part.</p><p>There are some new and interesseting bricks in this set, but not a lot. If you are going to buy the large forrest police station (4440) then don't bother with this set, and if you are going to play ""police chase"" rather than just hide the robber's car in the shack, then I think that set 4441 offers better value for money.</p><p>Buy this set when on sale, if you like me just have to have every single police set ever produced.<br></p>",TRUE,3,5,3,4,2
"Drake_bd","2012-04-10T16:42:09.857Z","Great set!","Hi,<div><br></div><div>I bought this set last week for €39,99 in a LEGO Store and I have to say it's a really great set. THe minifigures are really nice, you get two of the forest police officers and they're torso is really detailled. You can see their transponder and LEGO has even thought of designing the wire on the back. They're really great figs, although you get atleast one of them in almost every set.</div><div><br></div><div>The bandits are also nice, one has a loose overall and a dark red cap, the other one has a jacket above his prisoners garb and is wearing a pilot helmet.</div><div><br></div><div>I really love the bear, it's a phantastic LEGO animal and it has opposable legs, so you can let him stand up if you like (and I do like it ;) ).</div><div><br></div><div>The vehicles are great as well, the bandit's hotrod is really nice, although I didn't liked it in the beginning because of the ugly window and because the car is tilted.</div><div><br></div><div>You get a trike, which I like a lot.</div><div><br></div><div>You also get a nice police SUV. I recommend applying the blue sticker on the roof instead of the motor hood, I just think it looks better that way.</div><div><br></div><div>The cabin is really nice, although I don't like some of the gaps it has. What I like most is that the cabin goes really well along with the rock and the tree. It makes it a really peaceful scenery.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I think there were 2 instruction booklets, but I'm not really sure.</div><div><br></div><div>I totally recommend this set, LEGO has done a wonderful job, and I find it a creative, interesting set which is totally worth buying. I hoped my review helped you and I apologise for my bad English :D.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"one_wag","2012-05-06T04:25:18.487Z","Hot Rods and Bears!","<p>Having just purchased this from Toys R Us and building it in just under 30 mins I felt compelled to review this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two vehicles are some of the best designed mini-fig scale vehicles to come out of the LEGO factory in a while (IMHO).&nbsp; The Hot Rod is sleek, stylish and looks fast standing still.&nbsp; The police 4x4 is very well thought out.&nbsp; The styling is between a UK Land Rover and a US Jeep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-figs I thought were a let down - two hill billy criminals - again you can have so many prison uniforms - a different torso or even a female minifig wouldn't go amiss. Also the law enforcement side - they are all the same in all the sets - some variation wouldn't harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cabin is so-so - you do get a large green base (massive plus for moc-ing) and some new brick printed bricks - but the build is rather squareish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bear is excellent and the cheapest set (to date) where you can get him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which leads me to the price - Toys R Us had this set listed for £39.99 - however as I had some vouchers I got it for £29.99 - I still think even this was a fiver too much.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all a good all rounder set - just let down by the mini-figs and the price.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"wwward","2013-01-16T07:20:59.27Z","Disappointing ","First of all, I bought this set because I like houses that are playable for minifigs. There's also a nice old-looking car from the robbers and a new LEGO bear.&nbsp;<div>This set doesn't have a lot of pieces, which makes the price too high.&nbsp;</div><div>The building isn't that much detailed and it's very small and empty.</div><div><br></div><div>I would rate it 3/5, because it's not the worst set ever, but it isn't a good set either.</div>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,1
"miamiheat631","2013-11-09T22:47:21.14Z","So Many Details, So Awesome","<p>I received this set for Christmas a while back and it is very cool.&nbsp; I added the cabin as a house in my LEGO city and the Hot Rod went with it.&nbsp; The two police vehicles went into my police car lot and the bear, well he's off roaming the city.</p><p><strong>Cabin</strong></p><p>The cabin is&nbsp;a pretty good size with a nice porch out front.&nbsp; You get new mason bricks (awesome) in a tan color.&nbsp; Going inside, not much detail, but there is a chair and a table made by the mailbox.&nbsp; Speaking of the mailbox, it is next to the garage.&nbsp; The main part of the cabin is the garage.&nbsp; It takes up 90% of the house and fits about any vehicle that is not too high.&nbsp; There is a large, flat roof for watching for the police.&nbsp; One thing I don't understand is that there is a chimney but no fireplace.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Hot Rod</strong></p><p>The hot rod is pretty simple, with seating for one.&nbsp; The front end resembles an old-timey car.</p><p><strong>Police Truck</strong></p><p>The police truck has seating for one in the cab and the tailgate opens and closes.&nbsp; One thing I like about this vehicle is that it is relatively high off the ground.</p><p><strong>Police Trike</strong></p><p>The police trike is basically what the name says, a trike.</p><p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p><p>In this set, you get two forest rangers (identical except the head), and two criminals, one with and aviator helmet, the other with a red beard.&nbsp; There is also a large bear with a moving head and rear end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this is a pretty good set for young kids and people with large LEGO cities.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
