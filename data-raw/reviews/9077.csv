Out of that line-up, we will be reviewing Anakin's Jedi Interceptor.<br><br>Essentially, the set is a redesign of previous Episode III Jedi Interceptor models as seen in 2005 and 2007. Some redesigns have been good, others not so good. But what of this set? <br><br>Let's find out!<br><br><h4>Pros<br></h4><p>Firstly, this fighter is a lot of fun to build! The cockpit features a more rounded design than previous versions, with more sloped pieces making up the underside. The blocky 2005 versions are outdone by this by a mile! The cockpit interior has several curving tan pieces and looks very refined. Also in there are a couple of brackets to hold Anakin's lightsaber. The engines on the rear, made up of 2x2 round bricks, have some real heft and look cool too.<br></p><p>The wings are another example of how far LEGO's interceptor design has come along; while the same sort of slanted wing parts are used, the wings are much wider and thicker, and are a lot more detailed. Rather than stickers, the vent portions are made up of grill pieces, which is a brilliant idea!&nbsp;</p><p>The best thing about this version is the droid socket - now there's room for a whole droid! This is also done brilliantly. Lastly, the cannons have done away with those blue lamp bricks and are a lot more realistic, and they make the model look even more awesome.</p><p>The figures included - Anakin (obviously, with double-sided head; both expressions look pretty creepy and awesome!), Obi-Wan (like Anakin, he has a double-sided head with two great expressions!), R2-D2, Nute Gunray - he's new - and the Battle Droid are a good number of figures for a set this size and price. Nute Gunray is very impressive, and looks movie realistic.</p><p>A great part of the set is the mining droid and platfrom included for Anakin and Obi-Wan to duel on, like on Mustafar in the movie! Floating on transparent 2x2 round bricks above round plates with flame pieces that look wonderful, they're easy to build and look superb, especially as part of a display!<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Cons</h4><p>And here they come! The Cons have arrived. <br></p><p>First off, stickers. There's a few. The wings on Jedi Interceptors have always been a pain, but this set has double the normal amount - for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">both</span> sides of the wings. Shudder. The ones on the nose are pretty easy, though - phew!</p><p>Carrying on, the viewport and canopy printing are slightly iffy in terms of printing. They're not too bad, but would it be too much to ask for spotless precision? Maybe it is...</p><p>Lastly, the wings can be a little dizzying to build because of the vast number of plates used. This isn't too much of a problem, though I got a little cross-eyed during construction.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><p>If you can't be bothered to read that thing, then here's everything I've just waffled on about!</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Fighter is well constructed</li><li>Some rare and unique pieces!</li><li>Full droid socket - wow!</li><li>Minifigures look wonderful</li><li>Mustafar props look excellent</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Stickers (though that whole thing has been done to death by now)</li><li>Printing ain't perfect (but when is it perfect, huh?)</li><li>I got cross-eyed while making the wings - it's probably subjective, though!</li></ul><h4>The Last Words</h4><p>In short, this set is great value (although it could be Â£5 cheaper), and has some superb play value, pieces and figures. Get it if you can!</p><p><br></p><p>The best Jedi Interceptor yet!<br></p><p><br></p><p>- maabooooooo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Legolover9531","2012-02-12T19:00:25.3Z","Best of the first wave of 2012 SW sets!","<p>Out of all the firrst 2012 SW sets, this one is definetly my favorite. Why? Well read on!</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>I like the new box design, as the minifigs don't hover over the image! The back of the box shows the scene from Revenge of the Sith in a little comic style. The instructions are in a booklet of around 65 or 70 pages. One thing I can say is I don't like Darth Maul lurking in the backround. Maybe I'm just too used to Vader being in the backround...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The window is a very unique part, just like most of the other SW windows. The wings could easily be used to make a Star Tours logo. What can I say? The ride is great!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The set has 5 minifigs, 3 of which are redesigned and exclusive to the set. You get a redesigned Darth Vader (or Anakin, but Anakin is so called 'dead' at this point). You get dark eyes with an angry mouth for fighting, while the other side is for Vader to burn in the lava. Obi-Wan is looking great, as we finally have a true ROTS Obi-Wan. We also finally have a movie verson of Nute Gunray, as the other was a CW version. Nute Gunray looks great, and I'll probably use his head to make Hobgoblin from Spiderman. As for the other 2, you get a security battle droid with a red body, and an R2-D2 (mine had a head misprint; a first for me). Overall, the minifigs are great!</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is very easy and took me less than 30 minutes. It should be a pretty easy build for most.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model looks great. The ship is wonderful and the platforms are a bonus. There's no seat in the cockpit, but you can fit Vader's lightsaber behind where he sits. R2 fits nicely in his spot, but sometimes <strong>it goes with him :/</strong></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is a magnificent set, but I have 2 complaints, each putting .5 off my score. One, the set is overpriced, with around 13 cents a brick. My other complaint is a lack of Padme. Hey, she's important to the scene! That aside, the set is wonderful and I give this a <strong>9/10</strong></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3

"CapnRex101","2012-05-31T14:45:13.793Z","9494 - Anakin's Jedi Interceptor","<p></p><p>One of the most legendary scenes in the entire Star Wars saga has finally been given the set it deserves. The older set 7257, Ultimate Lightsaber Duel, was suitable for younger children with plenty of playability and lots of features, but it really needed updating and at last we have this set, and what a fantastic set it is! Five superb Minifigures, a nice Eta-2 Actis Class Interceptor model and a couple of bits of scenery to accurately recreate the scene from the film. Let's have a look at the set in more detail...</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is really wonderful, the front shows the newly appointed Darth Vader and R2-D2 piloting the fighter over Mustafar, which is clearly visible on the left of the box cover. There are a couple of&nbsp;explosions to add a sense of action and movement, as well as&nbsp;a small framed image of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker (now Darth Vader)&nbsp;duelling&nbsp;on the&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;floating&nbsp;above&nbsp;the lava on Mustafar's surface. The entire box has the new dark blue border which I love with a gallery picture of the five&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;included in the set, the three new Minifigures are highlighted with a stamp next to each of them. The top border of the box shows that incredible shot of Darth Maul in action swinging his deadly lightsaber around on the same dark blue background, which towards the left of the box turns white beneath the Star Wars logo which looks great. The back demonstrates all of the features of the set including the opening cockpit, adjustable wing flaps and flick fire missiles. There are also some images of the duel as it unfolds in the movie, first with Nute Gunray looking terrified at the destruction of his final guard, leaving him helpless to defend himself from the Sith Lord. Then a shot of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader duelling over the lava rivers, and then finally, the defeated Darth Vader as the lava rises around him with Obi-Wan watching as his former Padawan is engulfed. Those three images in particular I adore and I hope they include images like these more often. Finally, there is a group of blueprint pictures of the starfighter from various angles.</p><p>The instructions share the same cover image as the box and I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>There are plenty of nice parts in this set, the most attractive of which is probably the vast amounts of dark green in the set. There are smooth and studded plates and some nice tan sloped pieces, as well as the lovely wing tip pieces and the unique Jedi Starfighter canopy. There is a fair compliment of brown as well and two red circular plates which are rare and could be very useful for inclusion in your own creations! I also very much like Nute Gunray's elaborate dark red hat, in the dark bluish grey colour featured in set 8036, Separatist Shuttle, it looked somewhat underwhelming so I am delighted that we now have it in a more suitably regal colour.</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are five Minifigures in this set and they are all superb. I will start with the fairly basic <b>R2-D2</b> which we have seen numerous times before, he is a lovely figure though with plenty of detail on front and back of the dome as well as a very detailed print on the cylindrical torso. Next, the <b>Security&nbsp;Battle Droid</b> is similar to what we have seen before, however unfortunately it is not identical to the one from set 7877, Naboo Starfighter. This droid has a completely dark red torso with no printing or detail, I would have preferred to see one with a printed torso coming in this set but I am glad that the figure was included at all as Lego were certainly not obliged to add it, so overall I am&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;satisfied&nbsp;with this Minifigure. He carries a short blaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we come on to the really excellent new figures, starting with <b>Nute Gunray</b>. He wears the lovely red&nbsp;mitre&nbsp;I mentioned earlier on in the review which has lovely moulded details and is accurate to his appearance in this scene from Revenge of the Sith. His face is olive green and has extremely good details with plenty of wrinkles and shiny golden eyes which look very sinister as well as a&nbsp;disdainful&nbsp;grimace which is very suitable for his cowardly character. His torso is dark orange with brown arms and olive green hands. It is printed on the front and the back with lots of ornate patterns and folds in the cloth which continue on to the slope which forms the lower part of his outfit which is also dark orange and has similar printing to the torso piece. Overall a superb Minifigure which is far superior to the Clone Wars one we have seen&nbsp;previously.&nbsp;</p><p>My favourite two Minifigures in this set however are Anakin, or Darth Vader, and <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b>, both of whom look incredible. Obi-Wan is a fantastic Minifigure, his hairpiece is very suited to him and is the same as the one we see on the Clone Wars edition of his character. His face print is also excellent with a simple ginger beard and eyebrows as well as a bit of wrinkled detailing. His head is double sided with one side showing a straight face and the other with gritted teeth, apart from that they are just about the same, although the angrier face has a couple more wrinkles around his eyes. His torso is highly detailed with the folded cloth of Jedi robes and a brown belt with a silver buckle. His legs are plain dark tan which looks great&nbsp;combined&nbsp;with the lighter colour of his torso and is accurate to the film, he comes along with his famous blue lightsaber as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The best of the bunch for me however is <b>Darth Vader</b> himself. His hair piece is the same mould as that found on his Clone Wars incarnation but is cast in a much darker brown colour which reflects his new allegiance to the Sith as well as being a bit more accurate to the film than the lighter brown. His double sided face is absolutely spectacular with loads of scars and folds in his skin which he has picked up from his various encounters during the Clone Wars, as well as a hatred filled expression and sunken eyes. The other side has another serious face but this time with the evil yellow eyes of a Sith Lord and some more scarring. His torso is incredibly&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;with folds of cloth and Anakin's unique dark brown and black Jedi robes. He wears a lovely brown belt with gold highlights which is continued onto the back of the torso. The Jedi robes are also printed on the back and look excellent. His legs too have some printing, they are predominantly brown, but the top half of the front of each leg is printed black to reflect his appearance in the movie. He carries a blue lightsaber just like Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build does not take too long, about thirty minutes. It uses a few interesting techniques, for instance the way in which the flaps at the tip of each wing are attached using various clips and bars. The way in which the guns are made is also fairly interesting both on the inside and outside edges of the wings, much more durable than the ways in which the guns have been attached previously to these fighters. It must have been quite difficult during the design process for the designers of the model to create a good strong left wing when such a large hole needed to be left for R2-D2 to sit in. They have totally achieved this aim as there is no way the model is going to crumble as you fly it around. It is also nice to see how the arms have been attached on the lava collection droid (DLC-13 Mining Droid to be precise) using Exoforce robot arms and&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;tube connectors. There are several stickers in this set which could be a bit off putting for sticker haters but I would not worry too much, they are very easily applied as they are mostly very large stickers. If you prefer not to apply them at all, that is fine as well because it does not really take away from the look of the set, but it is certainly worth adding the grille stickers beneath each wing tip panel which look outstanding on the ship.</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the model is ready to go, it looks superb. The scenery elements look accurate to the film and are a great inclusion allowing you to have an epic battle with your Obi-Wan and Anakin (or Darth Vader) Minifigures. I live how a bit of lava is included beneath them for extra realism and they are supported by&nbsp;translucent&nbsp;cylinders to give the illusion of them hovering above the lava. On the mining droid I love how they have created the illusion of the top section with the droid's eyes floating above the bottom section using a single translucent stud which works very well. The other platform has adjustable flaps and some kind of light beacon being held up on a pole in one corner just like in the film. The Jedi Starfighter itself has perfectly captured the unique shape of the wings and the cockpit, which I quite a difficult task in Lego. It has plenty of features including an opening cockpit, two flick fire missiles slung beneath the right wing of the ship, and the four opening air flaps which look great when opened or closed. The wings can be adjusted as well from just next to the cockpit on either side and there are clips inside the cockpit where Anakin's lightsaber can be stored if you&nbsp;separate&nbsp;the blade and the hilt. Best of all however is the ability to place R2-D2 into his place on the wing, a feature which has been absent on previous incarnations of this ship and looks really incredible. Some people were concerned about the legs sticking out under the ship when viewed from the front, but you hardly notice them due to the symmetrical missile pod on the opposite wing. The only negative I have to say about the entire fighter is the look of the ship from beneath. Whatever you do, when you are flying it around, avoid looking at the underside of the wings as they are utterly chaotic featuring a vast array of mismatched colours. Nevertheless, this is fairly easily ignored as this area of the model is hardly on show at all and it can be fixed with a couple of colour swaps.</p><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I would certainly recommend this set. It features five excellent Minifigures,&nbsp;including&nbsp;the especially wonderful Nute Gunray, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader. The three models all look lovely as well and the entire set is filled with features and&nbsp;playability. Who would not want to recreate one of the most famous duels in the entire Star Wars saga? This set gives you all you need and more to do that, as well as allowing you to form another excellent scene from the film where Darth Vader executes the various Separatist leaders in Lego! The cost too seems perfectly reasonable, especially given that five Minifigures are included and the two duelling platforms. I am very pleased with this set indeed, which I previously dismissed as one of the weaker sets of the wave. However, due to the lack of any printing on the security Battle Droid Minifigure and the dreadful appearance of the underside of the wings I am going to dock this set one point, which still leaves it with a very respectable...&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"Chills","2012-09-24T14:39:15.147Z","If you're not with me, then you're my enemy","<p>This set was never on my wanted list until I saw it at Target on sale. I picked up the box and took a closer look at it and saw not only did it have the Jedi Interceptor, but it has a couple of the droids that hovered over the lava fields of Mustafar; plus Nute Gunray and a security droid. Impressed I picked up the set and recently had the pleasure to build it. Wow, this really is a great set!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First of all the Jedi Interceptor looks just like it does in the movies. Folding wings, large canopy with the front that reminds one of a TIE fighter, the green color, and a slot for R2. The Mustafar lava droids are also spot on from ROTS, the details are there including fire underneath them.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The build was quite enjoyable (except the stickers). The set it broken up into 4 sections and bagged as such. I think that was a bit overkill since the sections are pretty small, one or two would have been fine. But that didn't take away from assembling this ship. Its cool to have dark green, you don't see that often in a Star Wars set. <br></li><li>Pro 3: As others have said the minifigures are awesome! Anakin has two faces, one being his yellow-eyed Sith face. Obi-wan also has two faces. I like when Lego does this, it gives the figures more flexibility. You also get Nute Gunray, which with the previous two I mentioned are all unique to this set. Great additions to the collection. Security droid is my first battle droid, and he's in this set and the MTT, which makes him uncommon. Then you have R2, common, but necessary for this set.</li><li>Pro 4: There's good playability with this set. The ship is sturdy and swooshable, the cockpit opens and closes neatly. R2 sits neatly in his socket. I wondered how Lego was going to fit him in there with such a thin wing, but he looks pretty good in the slot. I already mentioned the Mustafar droids, which add to the playability. Nice job on this set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The first con is definitely the stickers. In older sets Lego would print the details on, but stickers are so much more common now. <br></li><li>Con 2: There appears to be a missing piece at the front left side of the cockpit. I think the 1x2 grill should be 1 plate higher. <br></li></ul>
<p>Lego really did a great job with this set. The ship is just like it is in the movie, as are the doids and the minifigures. You get 5 minifigures, which is a lot for a set this size, and you also get the Mustafar lava doids. Everything in this set is a great addition to your collection. And if you're lucky you can find it on sale as stores need shelf space for the latest batch of Lego sets. Pick up one of these, you won't be disappointed.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

<p>The box looks good &amp; all, with good detail, &amp; the instructions are good.</p>

<p>The parts are okay, with the limit of stickers.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;are what&#39;s questionable, though. &nbsp;If they had&nbsp;Nute&nbsp;Gunray&nbsp;&amp; a Security Battle Droid, why didn&#39;t they have the few others that were at the meeting that&nbsp;Anakin(Vader) killed, like&nbsp;Ruun&nbsp;Haako,&nbsp;Wat&nbsp;Tambor,&nbsp;Poggle&nbsp;the Lesser, &amp; a couple regular battle droids? &nbsp;If these&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;were included, the value for money would get a 5 rating. &nbsp;The double-sided heads for&nbsp;Anakin(with&nbsp;Sith&nbsp;eyes on 1 side &amp; angry face on the other) and Obi-Wan(with concerned look on 1 side &amp; angry face on the other) bring it to a 4, rather than a 3.</p>

<p>The build was great, but not perfect. &nbsp;There were a few minor confusions, such as how to arrange the wing tips&nbsp;&amp; stuff. &nbsp;But not a major issue like what&#39;s next.</p>

<p>The completed model looks good, but the problem is that the wings come off. &nbsp;They&#39;re attached by ONE brick each to the cockpit, &amp; after they come loose, they snap off of the&nbsp;bendy&nbsp;part.</p>

<p>My overall opinion is that it&#39;s a good set. &nbsp;Not excellent, not great, but good. &nbsp;I would recommend it if you&#39;re trying to get sets from the fight on&nbsp;Mustafar, but otherwise, it&#39;s honestly up to you.</p>
