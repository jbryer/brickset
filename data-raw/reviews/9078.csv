<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigs: the woman's hair is very nice and rare. The truck driver wit the red hat is great, but the forklif driver has a weird face I don't like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bins: The little station is a nice little touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts: The sign posts are new. includes new green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price for thirty dollars this is a great set</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truck the truck is very nice . I like how you can put the broom and shovel in the back of the cab. Also the cab has good minifig space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forklift: the fork lift is amazing I love it but the steering wheel maked it hard to put a minifig and the little lever always comes of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>build: The build is not hard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability: 100%</p>

"LCPTF8404","2012-04-29T21:57:11.203Z","You'll want this set on your Birthday for sure!","The Lego City Recycling Truck #4206, I got this set on my Birthday, along with the Lego City Ambulance #4431, the Satellite Launch Pad #3366, and the Power Boat Transporter #4643. When I got these 4 sets, I wanted to build this one first, but I built it last, due to it being the best. This set has amazing features, awesome minfigures and vehicles, and the best part of all, the big recycle bins and where they go. <br><br>1. The Minifigures: <br><br>This set comes with 3 minfigures, the truck driver, the forklift driver, and a civilian. The truck driver is cool every truck needs a driver. The forkilft driver is cool too, not only does he drive the forklift, but he also picks up the mess around the recycle area, the truck driver can too. The civilian woman, is also cool, she puts the recyclables in the bins and Lego is putting a lot more women minifigures in their City sets which is awesome. Putting her this set is an awesome touch, otherwise there would be no one to put the recyclables in the bins. All the minifigures are awesome, these 3 are perfect for this set. <br><br>2. The Accessories: <br><br>This set has great accessories, a shovel, broom, 3 pieces of paper, glass, and aluminum, and best of all, the new wheelbarrow piece. Of course you'll need a shovel and broom to pick up the recyclables if they spill. The recyclables are great. Paper, glass, and aluminum are what you need to go inside the bins, it wouldn't be cool if they did not come in this set. Because it would be pointless for this set to be made if there were no recyclables, because you need the recyclables in the bins, you need the bins for the forklift to carry, you need the forklift to put the bins on the truck, and you need the truck to carry the bins and drive them away. The last accessory in this set is the awesome new wheelbarrow piece. So far its in this set and the Tipper Truck #4434, another set I own and will review later. Anyway, the wheelbarrow is cool, its red, can fit about 5-7 stud pieces, and has the holders a real wheelbarrow has to make it stand. All the accessories a great, they're what makes this a winner. <br><br>3. The Bins and where they get placed: <br><br>The bins are my favorite part of this set, the blue bin is for paper, the yellow bin is for aluminum, and the red bin is for glass. They each have a lot of room to fit probably a dozen recyclables in each of them. The place where the bins go is great, they have studs in each of the 3 spots to hold the bins, signs to show you which bin you need to put the right recyclable in, and little fences on the sides to surround the the bins. The bins and they place they go to is great, especially the signs. <br><br>4. The Vehicles: <br><br>The vehicles are cool, there is a forklift and a recycle truck. The forklift is black and yellow, has a big arm to carry the bins, and a roof structure that moves forward to make it easier to put the driver in. It also has a thin piece to hold the arm, because it can't stand on its own. The forklift is great, its one of the most important parts of this set. And finally, the Recycle Truck. The truck is white and green, has holders on the back for the shovel and broom, and has studs on its flat surface on the back to carry the bins the forklift will place onto. Overall, the truck is awesome, its also one of the most important parts in this set. And its the reason this set has its name. <br><br>The minifigures, accessories, bins and where they're placed, and the vehicles are great touches for this set. The price is $30, but its worth getting the set though. You'll have a great time building, playing, and putting this set in your city. I recommend you get this set, I wanted it on my Birthday, and you will too.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 3 minifigures. The first 2 are meant for driving the recycling vehicles (truck &amp; forklift?) and they are dressed appropriately. A little bit more uniformity between the 2 minifigs (to show that they work for the same company) would&#39;ve been nice but it doesn&#39;t matter to much. The third minifigure is just representing your standard every-day person, who happens to recycle. Honestly, I don&#39;t think she is really needed in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 2 vehicles, the truck and the forklift. The truck is a pretty simple flatbed truck, with stickers making up most of the details but I don&#39;t mind the colour scheme and I like the small fuel tank details located between the 2 wheels so all in all, not a bad build. The forklift is also pretty basic. It is functional, and it does a good job of hiding that, but it isn&#39;t to special.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<p>The best part of the set ae the dumpsters. This set comes with 3 recycling dumpsters (each with a colour and a sign indicating whats supposed to go in it) on a 8x16 baseplate which once removed just has a section of fence at each side and a garbage can. This set would&#39;ve benefited from a two streetlights (one at the far end of both section of fences) to add a little more realism. The set also comes with a wheel barrow which isn&#39;t needed and they shouldn&#39;y have included and it also comes with a shovel and broom, and some things to act as recycling&nbsp;(like 1x1 plates for the rubbish can, 1x1 bricks round in lime green as cans of soda, beer bottles as beer bottles, and a couple 1x2 tiles as pieces of paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my opinion the best part of this set is the amazing playability. Everything just works together so well! It really is worth getting!</p>
