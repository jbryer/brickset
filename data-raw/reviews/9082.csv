So it's a freebie, except I noticed it had a nominal value of GBP7.49 when the nice lady rang it through the till, so perhaps TLG were planning to sell it for this at one stage. And it seems to change hands on eBay for around GBP15.00. So whether it's good value or not will depend on how you obtained it.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough with the finance. It's a boxed set, not a poly bag. And the front cover art proudly proclaims this is set 1 of 2. So this makes only half the vignette, or a quarter of the living room scene. It took my son and I about 15 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Walls are made of a rather rare sand red brick, and plenty of them.</li><li>It's free (maybe)</li><li>The painting of a ship you see 'hanging' on the wall is &nbsp;a printed tile, not a sticker</li><li>Looks rather nice on the mantelpiece</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Minifig is rather unexciting. Has stumpy legs for no apparent reason.</li><li>Dividing one set between two boxes is a evil marketing ploy.</li><li>'Limited Edition' branding on pack smacks of Collectible Princess Di China Plate branding, rather than Lego quality packaging.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>A decent little set, somewhat let down by the marketing aspect.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
