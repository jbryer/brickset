"richselby","2011-12-03T17:22:24.01Z","Not Worth Big Bucks","<p>This is the companion set to 3300020, or to quote the ghastly marketing blurb on the box ""Limited Edition 2011 2/2"". &nbsp;By itself it makes quarter of &nbsp;a living room Christmas scene, but the idea is you stick it next to set 3300020 and have half a living room.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK this was supplied free after spending GBP50.00 at a Lego store on the weekend starting 25 November 2011. They ran out of stock by Sunday afternoon, but plenty can be found on Ebay/Bricklink if you're prepared to cough up big time. &nbsp;The nominal value is GBP7.50 though, which is what it says on Lego's till receipt (first as a charge, then as a credit). Which gives you an idea of what it should trade at.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Proper box, not a poly bag. Proper instruction leaflet, not a folded sheet.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For a tiny set, it's generous with unusual parts. The walls are made of sand red bricks in various sizes. I've never had any parts in this colour before, so I'm pleased about that. As per the first set, there's also a nice printed tile with a boat at sea picture. Not sure why somebody would have the same pic displayed twice in their living room though. Finally, there's some 1x1 round plates which don't have a stud on top. Never seen those before either.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Standard Lego Santa but short legged. Is it just me, or is there something not quite right about Lego's rendition of Santa. Maybe the beard isn't bushy enough or maybe it's the pirate bandanna hat. But the red man doesn't quite convince. And as for the short legs, why?&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Straight forward enough. No surprises.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>As you would expect, it fits perfectly alongside 3300020 (part 1) to make a Christmassy living room scene. But boy, is it cramped in there! What with the overlarge fireplace and huge tree, there really isn't any room to place the two minifigures supplied. It's not difficult to lengthen the room with an extra middle section, assumin you have sand red bricks, but I would like it to work with the figs straight out of the box. Or boxes in this particular case.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>For free, lovely. A nice bonus. For the crazy prices people are charging for it elsewhere, forget it. Really there are so many better sets to spend your hard earned on.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,3
