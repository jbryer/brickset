I'm sure it doesn't bother many people, however it was definitely something that I noticed and frowned upon as I was building.</div><div><br></div><div>The build was... Meh- Nothing exciting. I wasn't all that impressed with the design/construction of the tree. What made no sense to me was LEGO including stickers with the words ""Merry Christmas"" in numerous languages when ""Happy Holiday's"" was already plastered onto the the piece that you could place the sticker on!</div><div><br></div><div>I'm glad I got it, but LEGO could have done better on this one.</div>",TRUE,3,1,2,2,2
