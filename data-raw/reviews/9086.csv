stuffers this year. Priced at $7.99, it feels just a bit over priced. 
But not by much. I suppose Inflation can be blamed, but I'd have liked a $5.99 price tag better.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>What you get and have is a Clear Ball Ornament filled with a bunch of solid &amp; transparent red 2x2 bricks. <h4>The build</h4><p>There isn't much of a build unless the LEGO Enthusiast in your life wants to open the Ball and pull out all of the bricks for other builds. Otherwise just leave it as an Ornament and decoration.<br></p>",TRUE,4,2,2,2,4
