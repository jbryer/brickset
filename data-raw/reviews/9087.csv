"AETerry","2011-12-27T15:39:48.397Z","Gold Ornament Review","<p>I picked this set up along with the Red Ornament for stocking 
stuffers this year. Priced at $7.99, it feels just a bit over priced. 
But not by much. I suppose Inflation can be blamed, but I'd have liked a $5.99 price tag better.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>What you get and have is a Clear Ball Ornament filled with a bunch of solid gold 2x2 &amp; transparent yellow 1x2 bricks. <h4>The build</h4>There
 isn't much of a build unless the LEGO Enthusiast in your life wants to 
open the Ball and pull out all of the bricks for other builds. Otherwise
 just leave it as an Ornament and decoration.",TRUE,4,2,2,2,4
"Slobrojoe","2020-03-23T16:18:05.037Z","Who doesn’t like gold?","<p>There appears to be four Christmas Baubles that were available: this one, a green one, a red one and a white one. I got this for Christmas a few years back in my stocking. Without further ado, let&#39;s begin!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 40 pieces in this bauble and has the most pieces out of all the baubles.&nbsp;<br />
1) There are 14 4x4 gold bricks.&nbsp;<br />
2) There are 14 of these 4x4 dark tan bricks (its official name is sand yellow but tan fits better). &nbsp;<br />
3) There are 12 translucent yellow 2x1 blocks.&nbsp;<br />
Please note that on the 4x4 blocks, the hole in the top of studs seems more pronounced than on other bricks. Another thing to note is that this (of the 4) is the only bauble that has 2x1 blocks.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got this as a Christmas present and I am therefore unsure on the price, but it will be worth it.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Packaging&nbsp;</p>

<p>These pieces come in a plastic bauble that come apart at the middle. Even when separated, the two sides are held by the ribbon that goes through a small hole on the top of each side.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t come with any instructions but instead lets you run wild. The first thing I built was a trophy and then took it apart to build something else.... except I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m not the most imaginative person when it comes to building ideas, but I seriously can&#39;t think of anything else to build using 40 gold and yellow pieces. Unless you&#39;re going to use them in a bigger MOC, they are a little useless, especially on their own. I have heard of people who keep the pieces inside the bauble to put it on the tree, which makes a nice effect, but seems a little top heavy. I use them as counters for a card game we play, which involves a lot of tokens for marking cards.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nice gold bricks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Decent bauble&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a bad Christmas present</p>

<p>Good for MOCs</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pronounced dimples on studs&nbsp;</p>

<p>No instructions/ideas&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s pretty much it!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the better small seasonal sets, and, although there&#39;s a big flaw, I still want to give it lots of credit.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this review was helpful!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
