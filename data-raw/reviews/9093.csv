"zipsforbananas","2012-07-17T12:52:41.4Z","Mmmm, orange bricks!","<p>I can't decide whether to really like these planet sets or not. The Death Star set was clearly amazing, but that was always going to be the case because it's the Death Star! The other planets in the first wave were bland to say the least, and I'm afraid Bespin is more of the same. The great thing about them though is that there's far more to them than the planet, and that's where the Bespin set excels!</p><p>The cloud car is amazingly bright orange. I thought I was ready for it but when I cracked the planet apart it dazzled me! And I hadn't been impressed from the pictures, it looked a little clumsy in the way the gradients didn't meet up all that well. But having built it I really like it. The techniques are really good, with studs on every side, and most of them covered up. What you end up with is bigger and bulkier than you would have though; it certainly feels a lot more worth the money than the TIE interceptor.</p><p>And the real treat is of course Lobot. You get one less piece with him than with most figures, but that's the best bit. His torso is very nicely printed, but you can't beat the back of his head! Makes me think of him dancing to disco music in Robot Chicken...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great cloud car, cleverly made with great pieces</li><li>Lobot minifigure is very nicely printed - puts the bland helmeted X-Wing pilot to shame!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Bespin is depressingly bland, but I suppose it always had to be, being a gas planet!&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>The best of the second wave of planet sets with the best ship and the best figure. The planet ain't great but you can't have everything. The price-per-piece ratio is fairly poor as with all these sets, but the fact that it's only £10 for the whole thing makes it pocket money and well worth the asking price nonetheless.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"DarthZared","2012-07-27T12:27:09.26Z","The best of the Planets","<p>9678-1 Twin-Pod Cloud Car &amp; Bespin is a £10 set from the Star Wars summer wave. Overall everything is great about it, so let's begin.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is small with the planet (which holds the pieces) sticking out of the front and back, which means in stores it could get damaged. The instructions are folded inside the box and are easy to follow.
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some rare pieces due to the orange colouring, with some nice bricks. It is a small set so there aren't many new pieces although the minifigure has a redesigned torso and headpiece.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4>The only minifigure is Lobot, which has never featured with flesh skin before. By far this makes it a must-buy for minifig collectors like myself as he is a great figure overall.<br>
<h4>The build</h4>The build is rather basic and includes some SNOT but is simple and easy. There are two main parts, the cloud car and the base, which join at the end.<br><h4>The completed model</h4>The Cloud Car sits nicely alongside Lobot on it's display stand which is a nice touch, but there is no room for the planet sadly. I do like the specially printed tile on the base which adds a unique touch to the set.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you are on a tight budget and want a great set, spend your cash on this set. It has a great figure in Lobot and is definitely a nice addition to any Star Wars fan's collection.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,2,5
"CapnRex101","2012-08-28T17:58:10.313Z","9678 - Twin-Pod Cloud Car & Bespin","<p>I rather enjoyed these Planet sets from the first series and as soon as I had managed to get my hands on those three, I was left eagerly awaiting series two. I must say however, the line-up for this series is underwhelming to say the least in my opinion. There are so many interesting vehicles, figures, and planets waiting to be created; and inexplicably we have ended up here with only one set which really lives up to and exceeds my expectations. The aforementioned set is in fact this one, the wonderful Twin-Pod Cloud Car, which also comes with an outstanding Minifigure, the silent and thoughtful Lobot.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packaging, like every other set in this Planet series, is quite different to your standard Lego box as it does of course have the large planet orb protruding from the front and back. This is undoubtedly a striking box design, but perhaps it has not been thought through entirely as it leaves the planet exposed to be scratched and damaged in transit or while it is on the shelves. So far, I have yet to find any damaged Planet sets, but I am sure it is only a matter of time unfortunately.</p><p>The front of the box is dominated almost entirely by the exposed planet, but it also features an image of the Cloud Car flying through space with a few green lasers blasts dispersed liberally around the vehicle. Along the top is the standard Lego Star Wars logo and the image of Darth Maul which has featured on all Lego Star Wars products this year. In the bottom right corner is a picture of Lobot, and in the bottom left is a shot of the gaseous giant planet Bespin. On the back is an image of the entire set all together, and advertising for the other two Planet models from this series.</p><p>The instructions are contained within the packaging outside of the planet sphere and are just fine, they have the same image of the Twin-Pod Cloud Car as the box does, and had no mistakes. As I would expect, I had no missing pieces either.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some wonderful parts included in this set, far more than in any other Planet set to date in my view. Here we get rather a lot of orange which is lovely and quite a rare colour. We get several curved slopes of different shapes and sizes, including one or two which are exclusive parts in this colour to this set! Of course we get the two halves of the planet, which may seem fairly useless, but I am sure there are uses to be found out there for it, just like there were with the planets in the first series. The last of my favourite parts included is the printed&nbsp;black&nbsp;tile with some information about the set displayed on it which is rather brilliant.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>This Minifigure is absolutely fantastic and is a vast improvement over any of the figures from the first series of Planet sets. <b>Lobot</b> is a reasonably minor character in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back but in his few moments on screen, he establishes himself as the Chief Administrative Aide of Lando Calrissian and the Cloud City Computer Liaison&nbsp;Officer. This character has been very effectively recreated in Lego here and this is only his second outing in Lego form.</p><p>The head piece features a&nbsp;solemn&nbsp;and serious expression which perfectly represents this rather impassive character. He has&nbsp;black&nbsp;eyebrows and some lines on his cheeks for definition, and on the back and sides, of course he has his cybernetic implant which runs almost all of the way around his head. It is highly detailed with buttons and dials and is in fact quite accurate to the prop in the movie which is extraordinary! His torso is also incredibly accurate and has the exact same light grey simple clothing as he wears in the film. It has various small creases in the fabric on the front and back, and he wears a black belt with a tiny control panel printed on top of it. There are several pockets on the torso and his arms are plain white which is perfect. His hands are flesh in colour and his legs are light grey and left totally unprinted. He carries one accessory, a simple short blaster.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is of course very short for this set, however it does almost entirely use SNOT building techniques in its construction. The entire model of the Cloud Car is built on its side using Erling bricks with studs on the sides of each brick which perfectly achieves the curves which make this ship so elegant and attractive to look at. It only takes seven or eight minutes, but it is a great deal of fun for such a small set.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is of course, absolutely spectacular. I will begin with the planet. This is a model of Bespin, the gas giant where one would find Cloud City, a mining colony set up to extract the valuable Tibanna gas from the planet. It is somewhat accurate, but it could do with being slightly darker in colour. Unlike most of the other planets it is not printed, but the wispy stripes and blotches on the surface have been created by mixing several colours of plastic before it solidifies which looks great in my opinion and is particularly suitable for making the planet seem gaseous, with no solid surfaces other than man made ones. On the top is a hook for hanging the planet up which looks marvellous next to the other planets in the collection.</p><p>The actual model of the Twin-Pod Cloud Car is truly awesome, and is incredibly accurate at this tiny scale. It features the twin fuselages which make the vehicle so unique and also the twin cockpits, which would seem to me to make the ship somewhat difficult to handle. The engines are also present in the central bar which connects the fuselages and there are some nice grilles which add detail to the surface of the ship. A stand for the vehicle and figure is included just like in the other Planet sets which has an area to display the vehicle, the Minifigure, and lists some&nbsp;information&nbsp;about what is being displayed on a plaque which is very nice indeed.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is without a doubt the best Planet set yet and I recommend it very highly indeed. The model is superb, the Minifigure is fantastic, and the planet is not too bad either, better than I had expected at the very least. I only hope that every model from the next series is as good as this one is.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"hjorgklopp","2012-08-14T12:16:07.523Z","Planet Sets Series Two - Bespin","<p>I purchased the Bespin Planets set when I went with my family to LEGOLAND Windsor. &nbsp;The Planets theme has interested me very much, and I also have Naboo from Series One. &nbsp;However, I was disappointed with Naboo, so I set my expectations fairly low for Bespin. &nbsp;But after the build was finished, I was surprised - Bespin is much better than Naboo!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the normal Planets box, nothing fancy to see here. &nbsp;It has LEGO STAR WARS in big lettering at the top, with the image of a Twin-Pod Cloud Car racing through space. &nbsp;Lobot is in the bottom left corner, while a picture of the planet Bespin is in the bottom right corner.</p><p><br></p><p>The instructions are fairly straightforward, comprising of about 30 pages. &nbsp;This may seem like a lot of pages for a Planets set, but there is only one step for page. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This, for me, was the highlight. &nbsp;Orange is the primary color, and violent orange it is. &nbsp;Some may complain that it is too bright, but for me personally it is fine. &nbsp;Others will complain that the violent orange is not movie-accurate, but since when have these sets been movie-accurate?</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Here is another highlight of the set: Lobot. &nbsp;Seen only once before years ago, this set is a chance for minifig collectors to purchase Lobot - for only&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px; "">£10! &nbsp;This is a relatively cheap set for such a rare minifigure, and collectors will not be disappointed. &nbsp;Lobot wears a fairly stern look, with his black eyebrows pinching downward, and the back of his head is dominated by machinery. &nbsp;His torso is a light grey with pockets. &nbsp;On the back of his torso are two lines indicating seams. &nbsp;His arms are white with flesh-colored hands, and his legs are a plain light grey.</span></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not long and fairly easy, with some SNOT technique involved. &nbsp;It took about 5-10 minutes, so something that can be done fairly quickly. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks fantastic. &nbsp;Lobot next to a Twin-Pod Cloud Car is a dream come true for me, and the beige gas planet of Bespin in the background looks fantastic. &nbsp;I was much more pleased with this model than Naboo. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set, and I am thrilled that Lego has started making Planets sets! &nbsp;This set is great for display but not for play. &nbsp;As always with LSW, the price-to-piece ratio is fairly bad, but better than the rest of the Planets sets. I would recommend this set to a collector, but not a small child. &nbsp;Some suggestions for Series Three:</p><p><br></p><p>Kashyyyk with Tarfful and and Wookie Catamaran</p><p>Hoth with a Rebel Snowtrooper and a Snowspeeder</p><p>Coruscant with a Senator and a Speeder</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks, LEGO! &nbsp;Keep up the good work!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,2,4

"Odeinoichus","2013-11-09T20:45:21.313Z","Lobot Returns","<p><strong>Set #9678 Twin-Pod Cloud Car &amp; Bespin: </strong>It has been over ten years since LEGO first made the character of Lobot available in Mini-Figure form, when 2012 introduced the planet sets we did not expect for this to happen. This is a must have set for three very important reasons.</p>
<p>Reason #1: The mini model build in this set features a great number of unique colored parts in orange, it also stands as a great looking miniature representation of the Twin-Pod Cloud Car. A simple, slightly repetitive build design due to the nature of the vehicle itself, this model looks great. It's fun to play with, fun to build and fun to just display on the stand included with it. LEGO did a great job capturing the vehicle in miniature scale, hopefully they might revisit it as a Mini-Figure scaled ship in the not too distant future as the larger model from 2001 is in major need of an update.</p>
<p>Reason #2: Lobot, this character has appeared a grand total of two times in Mini-Figure form, once back in 2001 and again now in 2012... I mean last year. This makes him one of the rarer Mini-Figures to obtain, both for fans of standard yellow colored Star Wars Mini-Figs and the new flesh tone versions. The attention to detail in his print is outstanding, they've upgraded the original yellow toned figure and given us a double-sided torso and head print which features all of the essentials for the look of the character. Including his unique mechanical headband.</p>
<p>Reason #3: The planet Bespin, mind you not everyone enjoys the planet pieces thinking them to be a waste of time, resources and money on LEGO's part. I firmly believe that each planet offers up some great looking set pieces for a display, and Bespin is one of the iconic worlds from the Original Trilogy.</p>
<p>Overall I strongly recommend tracking this set down, the Mini-Figure and mini model included in this set are two great additions to the LEGO Star Wars world, and Lobot is one of those classic characters a lot of fans enjoy having. This time he includes a standard blaster piece instead of just using a walkie talkie, which the original Twin-Pod Cloud Car included. Now if LEGO would only revisit Cloud City in a new set we might see some interesting set pieces for this to interact with. Definitely track it down, this set is still very easy to find and if you've been on the fence about it I'd say don't wait forever. You're bound to regret it, unless you don't happen to be a fan of Lobot. Or Twin-Pod Cloud Cars.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
