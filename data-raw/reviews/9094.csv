	Normally I would never do a review of such a tiny set but since no one else seems to have done a review I figure I might as well go for it.</p>
<p>
	I picked this up on May 24th at Colruyt in Brussels, Belgium. &nbsp;I&#39;m here on business for awhile and as there&#39;s a Colruyt just down the road from me and I&#39;ve got some time to kill and cash to spend so there we are.</p>
<p>
	<span><span>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_sw_planet_9679_s1.jpg[/img]</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span><span>Basically, this is fairly expensive with not a lot of pieces but it IS still reasonably cool. &nbsp;First, Lego Xmas ornament. &nbsp;This one in particular, the AT-ST &amp; Endor set, is reasonably ...well, not ugly. &nbsp;It won&#39;t horribly clash with a tree. &nbsp;The Bespin one IS going to clash with your tree unless you use last year&#39;s tree. &nbsp;Second, it&#39;s got the little plaque/display bit. &nbsp;It&#39;s got a bit of class and that&#39;s never a bad thing. &nbsp;Third, the mini AT-ST really is fairly cute. &nbsp;I loved the technique used to assemble the legs and the finished thing looks reasonably good. &nbsp;Last but not least, it&#39;s got a little AT-AT/AT-ST driver minifig (he&#39;s two-faced, BTW).</span></span></p>
<p>
	<span><span>What it doesn&#39;t have is playability (well, the AT-ST ...maybe a bit. &nbsp;But it is a tiny bit on the delicate/fragile side so...). &nbsp;Nor does it have interesting parts, IMO. &nbsp;How could it, with 50 some-odd pieces?</span></span></p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-09T04:37:36.68Z","LEGO Star Wars - AT-ST & Endor Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is a very useful set to have and it's a nice addition into any LEGO Star Wars collection for sure.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 65 pieces. The best part of this set may be the mould for the planet.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks very cool. The AT-ST driver has a small blaster pistol, a double-printed torso and face and the basic AT-ST driver helmet. The face of this minifig is the same which I've seen on the TIE Fighter set from 2012 and I've to say that the figure looks better with the goggles on the front.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.<br></p>

 set comes with a stant where you put the minifig and the vehicle on. The mini AT-ST is not very special, because we've gotten that model in some other sets before. The legs can be adjusted and the head does sviwel full 360Â°. The cockpit may be a little bit flimsy but looks still very cool. The planet itself has a stand and a piece which you can use to slide a string through that hole and hang it up in your room or on your Christmas tree if you want to.<br></span></p>

"Mandalorian","2012-12-26T15:53:08.48Z","Worth the price.","I got this set for Xmas, it's small but rather nice. Lets get to the pros and cons.<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice planet. It is made of two identical printed pieces, but that doesn't really show. Works well as a Christmas ornament. <br></li><li>The AT-ST is a nice, if small and not perfectly detailed, model.</li><li>That AT-ST driver is really cool, especially with sunglasses.<br></li><li>Good value for money.</li></ul><p><b>Cons</b><br></p>
<ul><li>The legs on the AT-ST are a little wierd.<br></li><li>Pretty boring build.<br></li></ul>
Overall, for the price, this set is definately worth it.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-11-16T18:28:07.12Z","AT-ST returns","<p><strong>Set #9679 AT-ST &amp; Endor:</strong> This is a planet set from Series 2 and features an Imperial Mini-Figure plus a mini model build of a vehicle which isn't too different from the original Miniature model in the Rebel Snowspeeder &amp; AT-ST set. Which makes this slightly&nbsp;less impressive than the other Planet sets.</p>
<p>The AT-ST model in this set is built with very few unique pieces, in fact the top of the AT-ST appears to be built the exact same way as the last miniature model. The legs are an improvement over the original build/design, while very similar there is just enough different here to make this a slight improvement over the original. It's a simple build too without any real challenge for younger builders, the pieces are still relatively small and easily swallowable though. So I'd caution anyone getting this for really young builders.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure isn't much new either, I mean he's an AT-ST Driver, which we've seen before. The printing is nice though as he does include a double-sided gray torso with Imperial uniform detail and a dual sided head, one side with goggles the other without. He includes that nice sloped helmet piece Imperials wear and a small blaster pistol as a weapon.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is one of the weaker offerings from the planet line, you'll notice I don't talk about the Endor, well as I've just discovered it would appear I got two halves that are both the same, which means... Well I'm not sure what. Unless Endor is meant to look that way, all I know is my copy seems to either be two of the same halves of the planet or LEGO really messed up. This one I feel is safe to skip honestly, unless like me you are a LEGO Star Wars Junkie who can't get enough. The Mini-Figure at least and the mini AT-ST models are a decent pair and slightly worth it if you can get it on discount for under 10$. Very slightly recommended for that reason alone.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3
"zipsforbananas","2012-08-17T12:04:38.397Z","Definitely all about the planet and that one printed piece!","<p>Most of the planets in this series, Death Star exempted, have been pretty lame, although in fairness to Lego, there isn't much you can do with a desert planet and a gas giant. <b>Endor</b> however is a real treat! Lots of green, large blue seas, and cloud formations combine to make the planet look really rather good!</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>AT-ST pilot</b> is good too, although he's only slightly different to the previous version. As with the last figure he's got great detailing, front and back, on his torso, and a good face with his visor down. His gun is a nice, small one, as in the films. The bonus is a second face with the visor up, and he's got quite a scowl on! The set would be worth it to get just him if you got 8038 and wanted an actual AT-ST pilot (8038 only gave you Chewie), and good to get anyway because of the different faces if you fancy having one pilot stood on the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>The real weak point of this set though is the actual <b>AT-ST</b>. I don't want to be too harsh because, for it's size, I don't know how it could have been better. The legs are the significant difference to the last mini AT-ST released, and though these are better (hinged bricks rather than all Technic) they still don't look right and don't quite give the right angles. The neck also looks a bit too tall as the turntable has 1x2-with-one-central-stud tiles on top of it.</p><p>On the head, the binoculars used as guns look rather good, the way the top face is split implying the hatch is very good, and the printed flag that gives you all the front face detailing is fantastic. But that doesn't rescue the head overall, which looks pinched and not quite rightly proportioned.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>By far the best actual planet yet</li><li>Good minifigure, well detailed, and nice variation with the double face</li><li>Great printed piece on the AT-ST, and a few clever uses of parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Unfortunately the AT-ST looks very badly proportioned over all, which kinda kills it</li></ul>
<p>This set has a magnificent planet, and a very good minifigure, but unfortunately the ship lets it down. The flaws are just too big with the AT-ST, I've got write it off as a bad job, even though I can't see how it could be improved at this scale, and it does have a few nice details. Put it next to the excellent 8038 full sized version, and the micro version from the Hoth game and it looks like a poor halfway effort that was released before it was quite ready.</p><p>But even with a poor ship, these sets are small and cheap enough that they are well worth getting just for one or two of the three features, so go for the planet and the figure and make do with the ship!</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3
"Sidebroad","2013-08-10T01:12:39.187Z","Tastes like chicken... walker.","<p>A good mini build with an excellent figure and above average planet.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard planets box that leaves the planet vulnerable to scratches. Some shrink wrap please? Instructions folded in half.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Has a selection of hinge piece and printed flag for front of walker head!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Excellent driver minifig with front and back torso printing. Double sided head looks great on both sides. Improvement over figure from 7657.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fascinating but flimsy build for the head. Lots of SNOT and half stud offsets.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Head seems a bit small but good overall shape. Nice double chin blaster. Decently poseable with swiveling head and adjustable legs.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Excellent and thus far unique minifig paired with with a good looking although somewhat out of proportion mini build. Planet actually looks pretty good with varying land colors, ocean, and clouds. Possibly the best looking planet (not including Death Star) through series 3. Good buy at 10 USD and easy buy at a discount.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Firox_5000","2014-01-26T12:48:22.543Z","Weakest planet set of 2012","<div>This was the third and final second wave planet I bought during 2012, and whilst it isn't terrible, it is certainly the weakest set from both 2012 waves.<div><br></div><div>The set comes in the typical planet packaging which consists of the small rectangular box with the instructions and contents inside the planet itself, which perks outside of the box and can be touched before opening.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build is a short and entertaining one, where the walker is built up slowly and more detail added throughout the process.</div><div><br></div><div>The endor planet itself is one of the more interesting planet variations from the second wave, in where colour splashings of olive and dark green, white and light blue have been used, which works on the planet very well, despite each half retaining the same printings.</div><div><br></div><div>The set's stand features the standard plaque describing what's included within the set, but doesn't contain a support for the model as the At-St is perfectly capable of standing alone.</div><div><br></div><div>The At-St Minifigure itself is a figure we haven't seen for a while in Lego Star Wars, and features an open front helmet piece using a dark grey colour, as well as featuring two facial expressions, where one is a serious look whilst the other is with goggles on. The torso piece is in &nbsp;light grey colour with belt and various pocket printings on the figure, whilst the back contains additional belt snd shirt printing too. There is no leg printing on this figure.</div><div><br></div></div><div>The model in this planet set, is an At-st, which although is quite a nice model, with rather accurate leg, gun and turret details is almost identical to a poly bag model released in the previous year. The model's top can rotate 360 degrees and is mostly stable except the top flap piece, which is slightly flimsy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, not the best planet set released in 2012, due to the repetitive release of a model which could've been brought a while back for much less, but includes a fairly good Minifigure. If you're after the unique figure, a collector or missed out the At-St model, I would recommend this, but otherwise, the cloud car would be a better choice to buy.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Black_Leader","2016-12-10T18:46:55.19Z","Underrated Gem","<p>To put it simply, this is the best overall of all the Star Wars Planets sets from a few years back. Other ones may have better minifigures or planets, but for my money this is the best of the lot. Read on to discover why!</p>

<h3>Planet</h3>

<p>Though generally the third wheel in this line, I think the actual planet included with the set looks very nice and is a fairly decent representation of the forest moon of Endor. Compared the swirly mess that was included in the Yavin 4 set, this sphere is much more accurate, looking just like the actual moon. The only issue I have with it is that there is an excess of olive green. I&#39;d say this moon of Endor is definitely ranks in the upper tier of planets, and is certainly more iconic than most of them.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I said this is the best of the planet sets is because the model is actually very playable! There are four different movable joints in each leg, and when that is combined with the rotating head and movable&nbsp;side mounted cannons, a lot of fun can be had moving this model around. Very different from the static Cloud Car for example. I also really enjoy the printed flag for the cockpit, a good reuse of an old print. While it is true that a similar model was released the previous year, I think this model is greatly improved due to the leg changes and printed piece. In short, best model of the series!</p>

<h3>Figure</h3>

<p>While he may not be as cool as Lobot or a TIE pilot, this fellow is actually a quality addition to any Star Wars fan&#39;s collection. Surprisingly, AT-ST pilots have only ever appeared in three sets, so this guy is actually a bit rare. If you have the Battle of Endor set from 2009 and need a pilot other than Chewbacca for your AT-ST, this is the way to go. He uses the same head&nbsp;as the 2012 Death Star Trooper, which is double sided with an angry expression on one side and glare reducing glasses on the other. Though there is no leg printing, the double-sided torso print is unique to this set and pretty intricate for its day.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I&#39;ve made pretty clear throughout this review, this set is definitely worth picking up. It combines the best of the line:&nbsp;a solid planet, good figure, and superb build.&nbsp;I personally have it displayed on my desk and it looks marvelous. With the new AT-ST that came out for Rogue One, it might be fun to display the two models side by side. You can pick this one up for relatively cheap still online, so go get yourself a chicken&nbsp;walker!</p>
