"Ernst","2012-07-01T07:41:24.177Z","Jumping Snakes : poor jumping ability but a good additional set.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : A nice little set and a great addition for the young Ninjago fans. The set gives you the Jay ZX minifigure&nbsp;and catapult with 2 snakes. The functionality of the catapult can be called poor but overall considering the content and price&nbsp;a 4 brick reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : The catapult too launch the snakes&nbsp;is the only thing to built and not hard to do which is normal considering the size of the set. Only a shame that it's not a very good functioning catapult, looks good but works poorly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : Great minifigure, 2 snakes, a sword and a load of usefull small pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : For the young Ninjago fan of course great playbility, would have been 5 bricks with a&nbsp;better working catapult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : We got this set as a gift but the normal price will be I think some €5,00 to €7,50&nbsp;for a set like this which is ok considering the good content.</p>

<p>Packet/Instructions</p>

<p>Double-sided instructions booklet with simple and easy to follow steps.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>It takes a maximum of 5 minutes for basically anyone. Has a golden katana and small snakes that are key in the Ninjago themes, are light green. It uses an unnecessary amount of pieces for what it is (a see-saw with a couple of snakes). The jumping snake effect is very exaggerated on the packet.</p>

<p>Minifig</p>

<p>Includes lightning-master Jay with a nicely printed torso and a silver three-quarter star on helmet.</p>

<p>Despite the rip off jumping snakes, the minifig&nbsp;doesn&#39;t disappoint and is a decent poly bag add-on.</p>
