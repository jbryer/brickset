As most new LEGO products its part are loose and flimsy, they fall off so easily. I miss vintage LEGO quality so much.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There is no box just poly bag that you will throw away after opening.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Hidden sword which is not exactly sword, just a kind of Japanese dagger.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One white ninja without sword holder on his back.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Simple and quick, cannot even call it ""experience"" ;)<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Its looks cool as long as you don't touch it, parts are definitely too loose and that affect&nbsp; playability.</p><h4>Summary</h4>Its good set mainly to show off, i don't recommend it for 6 years old kids as they says (maybe only very patient kids if they exist) because of falling off parts at almost every move. But anyway it cost 1 pound so still worth to get to fill your collection :)<br>",TRUE,2,2,1,3,4

"Odeinoichus","2012-11-30T12:54:36.1Z","Naming Conventions Strike Again","<p>Set #30086 Hidden Sword: A LEGO Ninjago Polybag, this set has the most dissapointing official name of all time for the kids, I mean I get LEGO probably didn't want to call this Hidden Sai because a Sai might not be as well known as a sword, however they could have simply called it something like Hidden Dagger and it would have made a bit more sense. (A Sai is more closer to a Dagger in size and function than a Sword.)</p>
<p>However, odd name choice aside, let us discuss the contents of the bag. You recieve 39 pieces, most of which are used to build a small weapon stand/case for the Mini-Fig (Zane ZX) to store his weapons. You get two silver Sai and one golden Sai hidden in a small recess built in the stand. The two parts of this stand do not connect on any sort of hinge joint (as the image on the bag might imply), instead they are two seperate sections.</p>
<p>As far as models go its fun looking and functional, the brown, red, gray and golden colored pieces all look great together, uniform, and instead of just giving ordinary clip joints to hold the weapons you get two black skeleton legs. (Which looks both awesome and what you might see as a decoration in an ancient shrine.)</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is Zane ZX, this version of Zane looks pretty impressive, the torso print, the new ninja mask piece with golden printing and even the facial expression are all very detailed. I especially appreciate the fact that he's got some Kunai or Ninja Throwing Daggers tucked into his waist band/belt. Now there is one thing missing from the Mini-Fig that is found in larger sets and with the spinner, his shoulder armor piece. Still a decent looking Mini-Figure even without that piece.</p>
<p>Overall I rate this set three out of five. It is fairly standard fare for a polybagged set, however if you want some great parts and a decent looking Mini-Fig you can't go wrong. Just ignore the fact that they call it the Hidden Sword, I certainly plan to. The model would look great inside any larger Ninjago Shrine set as an extra display piece too.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
