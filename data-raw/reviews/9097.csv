"Golem25","2012-12-29T10:19:54.713Z","A decent polybag, but not much more","<p>I managed to get this set as part of the Gamma promotion in the Netherlands. For every 50 Euro&#39;s spent, or a specific promoted item, a customer would receive a random polybag (look at the Bricklists to find out what other polybags are on offer).<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not a fan of the Ninjago line, but the minifig we get here (Cole ZX) is very nicely detailed, and would fit right in with any of the classic Ninja sets. His torso is printed on both sides, with his legs having received attention as well. The face sports an unamused expression and rather bushy eyebrows.<br />
<br />
The vehicle itself is more of a let-down; there are no rubber wheels included, and the build is as straightforward as one might expect of a polybag. It does come with gold cheese slopes, two gold tusks, and a pair of grates. I also like the fact that the designers have opted for handlebars instead of a steering wheel.<br />
<br />
Something to note is that the image on the front of the polybag is incongruent with the instructions. The curved black part over the back wheels is supposed to be placed sloping down to the back, while the cover has it the other way around.<br />
<br />
All in all, 30087 is okay. You get a great minifig and a reasonable vehicle with a bit of articulation on the &quot;arms&quot; (you can pretend them to be wings, I suppose). Proper wheels and a weapon for Cole are missing, but you could always have him use the gold tusks. The only spare part included is a third gold cheese slope.<br />
<br />
This review may have sounded a bit underwhelmed about the polybag, but make no mistake; you can&#39;t go wrong with a free giveaway, right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like ninjago , I am just going to get that out of the way and this is one of three ninjago sets I own .</p>
