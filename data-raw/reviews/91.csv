The red baron and sopwith are brilliant sets, but this one was so flimsy and so much dearer than the others. If you're looking for a plane, go for the other two.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

OK, it may have been a bit dearer than the Fokker or the Sopwith, but therefore it's a fair deal larger. About flimsyness, there's a little trick to prevent the fusilage from collapsing (or &quot;exploding&quot;) when attaching the main wings. After you have finished the wing assembly, find out what the right position is on the fusilage ,it connects to two flat beams which are already a part of the fusilage. Remove these beams, attach them firmly to the wing assembly in the right places, then reattach them to the fusilage and Bob's your uncle. Same drill for the top wing, put some tension on the cables by rotating the attachment points a bit and presto! A smart looking modell. I just love the little engine by the way. (Leave out one chain segment on the larger chain, otherwise it will drag). Getting the two propellors synchronized was a bit of a puzzle, but it all paid off in the end. Not a 10, because nothing's 100% perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"cowmaneater","2011-11-26T12:43:44.297Z","WOW! This is such a great set but like all, it seems so have its faults.","<p>Well, when i first got this set a few years ago I was WAY excited! I really wanted to build it! But then i found out that this set isnt neccessarily for a casual builder. Anyways, i stepped up to the challenge and got it done. Here is what i think.</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>the box is cool and accurate as are the instructions. The only thing that bothered me is that there was no parts list. With so many parts you really need one.</p><p><strong>Parts</strong></p><p>The parts were pretty  cool. There was some original stuff I hadn't used before on any set! But as i said, too many parts not to come with a parts list.</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>none, although wright brothers figs would have been sweet.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>It was all fun and games until the wings had to go on the fuselage. ""Hmmmm"" though I as i hopelessesly tried to get it to work. But finally i achieved my goal and the model was complete. I have yet to rebuild it and try the advice other reviewers give on this matter.</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>I can safely tell you it looked AWESOME! But because of the wing/fuselage issue it was flimsy and therefore only good as eye candy and not to play around with. I actually rigged up some nylon strings around it and hung it down from my ceiling. My advice, go ahead and do that, it really brings out the model (unless you have a cat like I do who will jump on it and bring it crashing down so that you have to rebuild it). haha</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>In the end this model is so worth your money even with its problems. This is a have to have for any respectable lego collector.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,5
