To get the car, you had to stand in line, and, once you neared the head of it, you were given a sheet of instructions and a sticker sheet.

<h4>Summary</h4><p>Great model, and hey, it was free! (in fact, it is probably even worth buying online, especially if you are a Cars completest.) Pity it has stickers instead of printing, though. <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
