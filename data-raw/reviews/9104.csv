<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The target piece for Bullseye's eye just rocks. <br></li><li>The model is simple, but very cute. <br></li><li>The little ears are just so adorable. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Last year's Bullseye just looks a bit worse than last year's model. <br></li><li>Seeing as I only wanted Bullseye, I really didn't enjoy the extra pieces for the other two models. <br></li><li>This is really quite minor, but I really would have liked the legs to be done with separate pieces so that it would have the realism factor. <br></li></ul>
<p>This set is really cool, and limited. It's almost like free Lego, in a way. If you can still get it, then go to Target right now and BUY IT!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
