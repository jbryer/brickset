"Der_Das","2011-11-04T04:06:34Z","Shiny contents is not just brick-bling.","<p>Yes, this is not just to dazzle us. The die could be used in games to distinguish it from the standard dice and allow special rules for it. As a budding game designer, this holds interesting possibilities for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A must have for me, although the price is on the high end of my scale. Bling lovers could wait for the keychain variant - if it ever will be sold. ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add. info:</p>
<p>Actually, the contents is not identical to '<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=2853588-1""><FONT color=#51abff>2853588-1: Promo Goldener Würfel (Golden dice)</FONT></a>'. This set contains an actual 1-pip tile whereas the former does not. In short, this set has 8pcs, the other edition has 7pcs.</p>

"Purno","2011-12-09T08:02:10.227Z","Nice pretty bouncy dice","<p>I tried ordering this set at Lego, it was unavailable as set, but I could order the separate parts for a total of €6,17 in the Netherlands including shipping at Lego Direct. To be honest, I expected it to be more expensive. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I received my parts in a transparent bag with a 4+ age indication. No instructions were present, but I was able to build the dice without. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>8 parts total.</p><p>The gold dice isn't entirely one color, but shows some minor color variations. <br></p><p>Oddly, the tile with 1 dot featured a slightly smaller dot than the dots on the other tiles. <br></p><p>I ordered this dice since I didn't found a complete dice in any of the games. To get a full dice you'd need to buy at least 2 different games. And this seemed the only way to get a gold dice, which can offer unique gameplay rules.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>As easy as it seems, it was. Since the dice is made of rubber, the tiles can be taken off relatively easy with your nails. <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Since the dice is made of some sort of rubber, it bounces more than it rolls. The dice can bounce in any direction. On a flat surface, it seems like there's a fraction of a millimeter between the tile and the surface, so the tile doesn't touch the surface. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Considering the other ways to get a complete dice in a color that doesn't seem obtainable in another way, I'd say it's worth the money. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,3

<br />
Has only been available in two polybags, both as promotional giveaways. This one and http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=2853588-1.<br />
<br />
This version has tiles with numbered dots 1-6 and a printed LEGO logo tile. Which is nice.<br />
<br />
Potential uses:<br />
- As a &#39;power die&#39; in a game.<br />
- If it&#39;s their birthday someone could be allowed to use the golden die.<br />
- Throw it at the wall and see if you can catch it when it bounces.<br />
<br />
If you like Lego games, then this is a fun item to have.</p>
