The combo set isn't bad, you don't have to worry about just a Blu-Ray or just a DVD copy and which to get. It's all there and the Blu-Ray disc has more features than what's found on the DVD.<br><br>I picked this up back when it first came out as it's LEGO and Star Wars. What can go wrong with that? Not a whole lot. Especially if you keep in mind it's geared towards kids.<br><br>It's a cute, fun LEGO theme episode of a young Han Solo, Yoda and other assorted characters jumping from incident to another across the galaxy. There's plenty of good LEGO themed humor and moments. <br><br>The discs are also chalked full of other LEGO Star Wars themed shorts. Like the Star Wars trilogy in 30 seconds. Many of which can be found across the internet and mainly through YouTube. For convenience, they're all gathered here in one spot so you don't have to go hunting for them.<br><br>For minifigure collectors, there's also a young Han Solo minifigure to get. While I've kept him in the case at the moment, he was pulled out at one point to allow a younger cousin to play with him while at my Aunt's house when we all watched this. That's why I put a two for building experience, parts and playability. It's due to the minifigure.<br><br>In all I'd say this was worth picking up and getting and I do hope if LEGO can keep to this quality or better, that we might see more of these types of videos available in the future.<br>",TRUE,5,2,2,2,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-15T12:18:24.617Z","A Menace Indeed, Good or Bad, is it?","<p>LEGO Star Wars The Padawan Menace is a made for DVD/Blu-Ray special similar to the LEGO Atlantis and Ninjago half-hour shorts that LEGO made for television.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference is that this one is made and sanctioned by George Lucas himself. It is actually quite hilarious, filled with wonderful sight gags and visual humor many associate with LEGO bricks. (Where else could Yoda take a blown apart Clone Trooper and rebuild him? Or Asajj Ventress throw out a batallion of self-building Battle Droids to protect her and her secret plans?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am however rating this properly, although I am a fan of Star Wars and LEGO Star Wars, what is here on offer is very limited. You have a brilliant short, The Padawan Menace, but there are no special features of any kind. No audio commentaries, no extended scenes for this DVD edition of the special, no true incentive for buying it outside of the LEGO Young Han Solo Mini-Figure included with the package. If you've seen it on T-V you've already enjoyed it, I personally enjoyed it enough to want to buy it, and the price for this set is a good value. But overall there isn't much to look forward too with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That doesn't mean they don't include any special bonuses, as there are a collection of LEGO Star Wars shorts you've probably seen on Youtube or at LEGO's own Star Wars site before. I personally was kind of hoping that the LEGO group would have teamed up with Lucas to add a bit more to this release, perhaps something along the lines of an interactive virtual set collection guide. (Sure it might have been outdated as soon as it hit the streets considering new sets are always coming out, but it would have added something that the children could have played around with on the menus perhaps with a build and re-build function that would allow them to combine the virtual bricks from the existing Star Wars sets into some wacky, goofy, creations.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children will still enjoy watching the antics of Young Han and Yoda, or 3PO and the Padawans, there are also some blink and you'll miss them appearances, such as Savage Opress, or other characters appearing in some of the crowd shots. And High Definition is definitely the way to go, I watched it on a High-Def Television for the first time with the BR disk and the clarity just popped, it truly looked like LEGO brought to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still wish for some sort of Virtual LEGO Star Wars game or two for the kids though, you can only watch it so many times over before you want to do more with the thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now on to the Mini-Figure. Young Han does look very nice, he has midget legs and a standard white torso with an open collar shirt print, unfortunatley there's no back printing, and for those of you who care it's the so-called inferior Chiniese Mini-Figure plastic used for this one. The hair piece is an all new design, at least to me, I haven't seen it anywhere else yet. And he has the trademark Solo smirk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really the only thing wrong with this Mini-Figure is that it doesn't include the IAN nametag, which would have perhaps made him seem less plain. Some might also find the lack of any accessories for him dissapointing, but honestly from a Bonus Mini-Fig included with a DVD/BR combo thing what do you expect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, while I find the short quite enjoyable and the min-figure a decent bonus addition, this product could have standed to have a bit more polish on it so the kids would have more activities to do virtually speaking aside from just watching the thing. I feel LEGO and Lucasfilm rushed this one out the door so it would be buyable as soon as the premier happened. Also, since you can only find it at Wal-Mart stores if you're somewhere Wal-Mart hasn't infiltrated yet, you are out of luck.</p>",TRUE,2,1,1,1,3

<br />
I had a relative who would have liked the movie, so I bought it for them and kept the young Solo figure for myself. The film is &quot;meh,&quot; nothing I&#39;d recommend tracking down to own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, Young Han Solo is a really cool and unique figure to own. If you ever see the figure itself being sold for cheap, I&#39;d say go for it.</p>
