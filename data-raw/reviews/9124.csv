The Flamenco Dancer was never going to be a highlight though, there are many brilliant figures in the series, but unfortunately, this is not really one of them. It is much like the Geisha Minifigure from earlier in the theme, sharing the use of a fan as well as the slope piece forming the legs. She is even red to match!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are few particularly interesting parts for this Minifigure. We start with her hair, it is simply the hair from the Ice Skater in Series 4 but on this occasion it is black.&nbsp;</p><p>The head is just a smiley female face, nothing special there but it could come in useful at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>The torso and dress pieces are the best bit, the torso has front and back printing of a nice spotty red dress, which perfectly represents what Flamenco Dancers really wear.&nbsp;</p><p>The slope part which forms the bottom of the dress is good too, with a continuation of the printing on the torso.&nbsp;</p><p>The only&nbsp;accessory&nbsp;included is her black fan which is the same as that of the Geisha from Series 4 but, again, in black!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you are a&nbsp;completest, you have to have this, but otherwise this is really one you can pass on, while it is not bad, it just lacks any 'wow' factor for me. My score reflects the distinctly mediocre feeling about this Minifigure, so...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 6/10</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,5

She also has black hair in the same style and mold as what the Ice Skater has. So there's variety right there. In addition is a new dress style for female minifigures. So she does get points all around for being a female figure and offering more variety, either for collectiblity or for those like myself who will pull these figures apart for MOCs and customizing other minifigures with.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-02-09T13:04:42.097Z","Hey Flamenco!","<p>Set #8827 Flamenco Dancer: A great new female Mini-Fig from Series 6, and she'll look great next to the Mariachi, now all LEGO Needs to do is give us a Male Flamenco Dancer, with Guitar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure has a double-sided torso print featuring the top of her stunning red dress, she uses a standard sloped brick for her lower body with the front print showing the rest of her dress. She has the fan and her new hair piece with the bun and a curled combed look, possibly a perm. Her facial print is very nice too with a great smile, red lips and fun flashy eyelashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that this is a great addition to your Mini-Fig collection and you should try to get her.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The face and hair are spot-on here.<br>-The front printing is also excellent.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The fan is not the best choice to me for some reason.<br></li><li>-the lack of back printing on the skirt is very disappointing.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>This is a good little set, and helps put more females into your minifig collection. I recommend this, but this isn't my favorite fig ever.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-11T15:14:45.607Z","worst of the series, BUT...","<p>The sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Flamenco Dancer. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and included 6 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that Ice Skater hair from Series 4 caste in a black colour. That hair in that colour was new for the figure, and it may even be exclusive to this day. I do like that hair design, and I like how it&#39;s swept to the side. The detail on the back of it is great as well.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a pretty good print. I like the smile, and her eyelashes add to her fancy demeanour. She has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay because the front one looks just fine.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and I do like the printing on it. The black polka dots on the red, ruffled shirt works really well, and her exposed, yellow arms are pretty cool. She has some really awesome back torso printing as well, which continues the black polka dot design.</p>

<p>Next is her dress, which is that older-styled dress design. The printing on the front of it is really great, and all the many ruffles is pretty cool. These types of dresses never have back printing, which looks a bit odd from behind, but it isn&#39;t a huge deal, since back dress printing isn&#39;t expected in 2012.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her fan piece. It wasn&#39;t new to the figure or anything, but it is a very fitting accessory for the figure. I still like the moulding on it, and it looks good in black.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, this figure is just okay. I used to despise her, and she is still my least favourite of the series by far, and I still don&#39;t like the figure that much, but I don&#39;t necessarily hate her anymore. Still, I&#39;m gonna have to give her a 2. As always, check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
