It has absolutely met my expectations and&nbsp;exceeded&nbsp;them now that I have it in my hand. The detail is absolutely brilliant and the crown piece is delightful, despite it being made from a rubbery material.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The crown, as I said is the highlight. It is extremely detailed with the little windows in the crown present as well as some texturing in the hair. There are just the right number of spikes on the crown too, which is a relief, as at first I thought there were only five from the original image. It is all one colour, sand green, just like the rest of the figure.</p><p>The face is&nbsp;also&nbsp;sand green with some purple lipstick and a fairly serious expression.</p><p>The torso is incredibly detailed with tiny folds in the cloth as well as the material all going in the same direction as on the real statue.</p><p>The legs are made by a slope piece which has a continuation of the cloth from the torso printed on it and yet more folds. This piece is also sand green.</p><p>The two accessories are a small tile with some writing on it which reads: July VI MDCCLXXVI (which in modern numerals is July 14th 1776) just like the actual statue! The fact that they put in that much detail I find totally&nbsp;astonishing! In her right hand she holds her trademark torch which has a standard orange flame coming from it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all this is one of the Minifigures from the Series which you&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;have to have. There are no flaws in it except the lack of playability. Despite that I still give this Minifigure full marks due to the amazing detailing.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"absolutelylez","2011-12-27T05:22:19.777Z","One of the best from Series Six","Not wishing to repeat the excellent review below, I will only add these points:<div><br></div><div>This is a highlight for series six because of the attention to detail: excellent printing on the front, a printed tile and an excellent headpiece with detailed windows on the front and very well sculpted hair on the back.</div><div><br><div><div>The headcrown is made from a softer plastic but not the same rubbery plastic as with other hair pieces we have seen e.g. cavewoman, mad scientist. This plastic is only slightly softer but probably chosen to strengthen the headpiece. I imagine that the crown would be easily damaged by children if the plastic had been too hard and inflexible.</div></div><div><br></div><div>One thing I dislike is the slight discontinuity in printing between the torso and the 'skirt'. It seems that Lego's printers cannot print right to the edge, so there is an annoying gap that seems to cut the robe into two.</div></div>",TRUE,4,5,5,2,3
"davy_jones","2012-02-20T14:08:27.297Z","They read my mind","<p>I am not a believer in focus groups or market analysis that corporations use to gauge customer wants and needs. Having said that, the entire minifig series leaves me wondering if Lego has the best team in the world to perform such tasks. It's almost as if they take the desires right out of our subconscious minds! From monsters to warriors to average joes,&nbsp;I bet I'm not the only one who's amazed by their ability to accurately produce an interesting line up. Of course some of the minifigs have had minor quality issues while others could have been packed with one or two more tiny accessories. This nicely settles me unto the Lady Liberty minifig. I was looking forward to this minifig and am glad they made it.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>1) Nice color</p>
<p>2) Torso art</p>
<p>3) 'Book' with Roman numerals as per the original statue</p>
<p>4) Torch</p>
<p>5) Excellent headgear</p>
<p>6) Soft plastic material for headgear is an interesting choice. Nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>1) The sides of her robe completely lack detail. Of course all minifigs i can think of except for the costumed ones are like this but a few flowing lines would have been a nice touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the real statue of liberty stands tall as a symbol of New York, this Lego minifig is outstanding in that it represents an idea that was culminated and executed well. </p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"AETerry","2012-03-21T15:27:52.077Z","Lady Liberty Review","This is one of the first minifigures out of Series 6 that I got when I saw that they had finally arrived in my area. As an American, this figure is certainly very patriotic and fun in that respect. The whole of the minifigure is a Moss or Money green color like the real Statue of Liberty is depicted as. There's printing on her front torso and front dress for the robes she's depicted as wearing. The only mar in the design here is that where the dress and torso meet, you have a gap in the printing as neither go all the way to the edges. Complimenting this figure well are the green tile piece for the year the U.S. is founded and the torch piece with a flame piece on it. Finishing out the minifigure is the specialized rubber hair piece with Liberty's crown.<br><br>While I do love the minifigure, it doesn't make it to the top of my list as an all time favorite out of Series 6 as I have others I like and love better. And at $2.99 for the minifigure, it still seems decently priced overall with the detail and effort put into this minifigure concept. With so many outstanding figures out of Series 6, this is another welcomed addition to my collection.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lady Liberty is made up of pieces made in a new shade of green, she stands proudly wearing her toga with a print that flows seamlessly between torso and lower body. The 2x2 Tile piece represents the scroll held by the staute and features a printed July 4th and the Roman Numeral for whatever year it's supposed to have been finished (I think) I was never very good at deciphering roman numerals of such size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The telescope and fire piece make up her torch. And her unique hair piece looks surprisingly good and close to the actual statue's hair do. (Having never seen it in person before I'm not confident to say it is exactly the same only in LEGO fom.) The facial print is highly impressive too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that if you haven't gotten this Minifigure yet you should definitely try to find it. She may not be ideal for displaying in your LEGO City alongside ordinary Minifigures, however she can't be beat, and I suppose she'd fit in for Masquerade or Costume Parties. She also scores high for being a highly impressive little collectible.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,4,5
"Dannyandy","2012-01-05T17:04:45.197Z","Great","This set as mentioned above is great and one of the must haves of series 6 along with sleepyhead. Its very good for Â£1.99 and in my opinion its not a minifigure that your disappointed at when you open the packet.<div>The one only issue is that it has a brick for legs and snaps off from the body very easily hindering playability slightly, but its probably best top make a stand&nbsp;and&nbsp;put her on it.</div>",FALSE,5,5,3,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-09T19:16:35.023Z","an OKAY figure!","<p>The fourth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is Lady Liberty. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that crown, which was new to the figure. The spikes on it look great, and the moulding on&nbsp;it, even down to the hair detail, is amazing. It&#39;s caste in sand green, of&nbsp;course, which is accurate to the real Statue of Liberty, of course.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a good expression, but the real Statue of Liberty looks nothing like that. But it makes sense to do a more realistic human face, because if they did a realistic design, it might have actually looked a bit creepy. She has no alternate expression, which makes complete sense.</p>

<p>Her torso has some awesome printing, and I love the ruffles&nbsp;all over that sand green cloak. She has no alternate torso printing, which is a bit sad, but it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Her dress has some awesome printing on it, and I just love how that torso design carries pretty seamlessly to the dress piece. It looks great, and I really like it.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessories. One of them is that torch, which is caste in sand green. That colour for it isn&#39;t that common, and I like it a lot. The flame piece is caste in the normal translucent orange. I don&#39;t know how much it fits the Statue of Liberty, because the real thing has a very different flame design. Nonetheless, her 1x2 tile has some good printing on it, and I love the &ldquo;July&nbsp;IV MDCCLXXVI&rdquo; on it, which is, of course, the first Independence Day.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, this used to be one mf my favourites of the series, but my interest in it has sort of waned. She&#39;s still a good figure, but I&#39;m just not that crazy about her. Still, she&#39;s okay, so I&#39;ll be giving her a 3 out of 5.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that&#39;s it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
