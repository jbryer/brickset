"CapnRex101","2011-12-19T11:15:11.21Z","8827 (3) - Clockwork Robot","<p>Along with the Roman Soldier the Clockwork Robot was the Minifigure I was most&nbsp;excited&nbsp;about when the&nbsp;first&nbsp;pictures were released. I am not&nbsp;disappointed! This is the best Minifigure of the Series save for the Roman, not only does it include two brand new moulds, but the detailing and&nbsp;playability&nbsp;is incredible too! Anyway, read on and see what all the fuss is about...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The head piece is a new mould. It is mostly light grey with blue eyes and a red and yellow mouth. There is a stud on top so extra&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;can be attached and there are two aerials embossed onto the sides of the head. It is not a cube as it appears to be in most of the images, the head is a cuboid which is as wide and as deep as the torso. It might have looked a little better as a cube, but it stills looks wonderful.</p><p>The key is a new piece too. It is attached to the back by a standard neck attachment which you would sometimes see forming part of a backpack. This part is light grey and the key is a pearly silver. I think the key could be very useful, I am not sure what for at the moment but I am sure there must be something!</p><p>The torso is incredibly detailed with various dials and displays as well as many little screws. There are some blue highlights on the torso which contrast nicely with the grey colours of the rest of it. It is very reminiscent of a real Clockwork Robot toy.&nbsp;Strangely&nbsp;the hands are red, but they do not take away from the figure at all.</p><p>The legs are printed with similar designs to the torso with springs, more screws and some grills adorning this part of the figure. The waist is blue and is also printed with some sort of display screen.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a figure which has to be bought. There is no getting away from it. If you only want to buy one, make it the Roman, but apart from that this is the way to go. As you can probably tell I am loving this Minifigure and so I am obliged to award it with...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 10/10</div><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"AETerry","2012-03-22T17:24:18.833Z","Clockwork Robot Review","With so many good minifigures in the line-up for Series 6, it's hard for me to say I like this one the best when there are other figures such as the Minotaur, Leprechaun and Genie that I like far better in comparison. The robot is a fun minifigure in a whimsical giant toy robot for a Minifigure or as a costume at a Halloween party.<br><br>Still, the detailing on this done very good in a retro 50's &amp; 60's style. There's a piece for the back of the minifigure that you can set the windup piece at so it looks like it can be wound up and the square head does make it easy to find this one in the packages in a store. At $2.99, I'm sure many will find this is well worth the price and I do enjoy having this one in my collection as I seem to have gotten on the idea of have a complete set of these now, not just random ones.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"Ernst","2012-05-17T17:34:24.35Z","Clockwork Robot, surprisingly original.","<p>Overal 5 bricks : Yet another minifigure that deserves a review. This little guy is very original, the first I see (not counting <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=bob001"">SpongeBob</a>) with a square head. The figure is cute, good colors and a surprising new part besides the head being the winder&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is none, 1 brick for assembling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : The square head and the winder key made me give the 5 bricks. The figure overall is nice too, great colorscheme with contrasting colors on the grey background. The red hands are a great choice, the print on torso and legs very detailed. The <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=42446"">bracket</a> on which you place the key&nbsp;could be&nbsp;very usefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing 4 bricks : Normally for a single minifigure I would give 3 bricks but this guy could be very usefull in a MOC. Not a figure you can assemble from other existing ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : â‚¬2,95 is a good price, no comments here.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-12T01:46:40.763Z","BEST CMF ROBOT!","<p>The seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Clockwork Robot. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that robot head piece, which looks fantastic. It was new for the figure, and the printing on his mouth and eyes is pretty great. It&#39;s actually pretty thin, and there isn&#39;t any detail on the back, which is okay.</p>

<p>The next part in the figure is that neck attachment piece. The stud on that part looks good, but what&#39;s even cooler is what connects to it: that wind-up piece looks fantastic, and was also new to the figure, from my understanding.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has more awesome printing. The classic robotic design is brilliant, with the little meters, and the blue and grey colour scheme works out pretty good as well. He has no back printing, but that&#39;s not such a bad thing, as it would look weird being covered by that neck attachment. His red hands are a very nice touch as well.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some good printing. I really love the robotic feet, as well as the robotic-stitches. I&#39;m also in love with the blue top section, and how it blends awesomely with the light grey colour. The printing on that little section is great as well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! As I said in one of my previous reviews, the Sleepyhead minifigure is my favourite in this series, but man; this figure puts up an excellent fight. The printing, the pieces, and even the colour scheme all come together for the ultimate LEGO Robot. This is the most iconic robot figure we&#39;ve ever got from LEGO, in my opinion. I&#39;m not necessarily saying this is the best LEGO robot ever, but this is for sure my favourite LEGO CMF robot.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this&nbsp;figure! Check out my profile, and, as always, thanks for reading!</p>
