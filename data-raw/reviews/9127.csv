"CapnRex101","2011-12-19T06:32:36.687Z","8827 (4) - Sleepyhead","<p>The Sleepyhead is an exciting figure, nothing like this has ever really been attempted before and I think Lego did a great job. There are two brand new moulds in this set, and both of them are really nice.&nbsp;The look of the figure is just perfect and is an amazing&nbsp;representation of somebody who is asleep or almost asleep. Also, this gives you an opportunity to actually have your citizens in Lego City in pyjamas rather than in their normal clothes when they are in bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair is a new piece on this Minifigure. It is modelled to look like hair which has not been combed as if the person has just woken up. It is brown here and I think it could be useful for other figures to add some variation in hair styles!</p><p>The head is almost my favourite part of the entire character! It is double sided, one side has an awake but yawning face and the other has a face for when he eventually gets to bed (he is obviously having pleasant dreams as he has a smirk on his face).</p><p>The torso is blue with white stripes running down it. There are four buttons and a breast pocket as well as an open neckline to the shirt, with some skin showing&nbsp;beneath. His arms also have white stripes running down them which look lovely.</p><p>The legs are blue again with the same white stripes as on other areas of the figure. The white stripes are printed on the belt piece as well.</p><p>His accessory however is the best bit, a brand new teddy bear piece! The piece is actually a new mould and is not the same as the older bear piece released in sets like 7848 - Toys R Us city truck. This part is smaller and his arms are hanging down unlike the older piece, not to mention this one having printing on its face and chest. It is predominantly the nougat colour first released with the Prince of Persia theme but has tan highlights and black detailing on the face. The bear can be held by the Sleepyhead by his arm or from underneath where there is a hole for fitting onto studs.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a very unique Minifigure. In my opinion it is worth buying only to get the teddy bear as that is truly fantastic although the rest of the figure is great too. The&nbsp;playability&nbsp;is lacking a bit in my eyes and so I have taken the decision to knock a point off so my final score is...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

I also like the double-sided face of this figure.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to

"AETerry","2012-03-23T17:12:07.717Z","Sleepyhead Review","At first glance, this doesn't seem like it should be one of the more note worthy or better concepts for a minifigure. At first, I was left feeling why? However after getting this figure out of a random pack when picking up several, I've grown to like it.<br><br>The print design on this figure done very well with both the legs and the torso (printed front and back) for a striped pajama pattern. Plus his head where on one side he's yawning and clearly tired while on the other side he looks to be asleep. In addition to this is the new style of teddy bear that comes with this and I especially like the new hair piece on this figure.<br><br>In the end, I'd say he's well worth it. Not just for Collectors, but those like myself who look at these figures for pieces to customize with and create MOCs. The price of $2.99 I'd say is fairly reasonable and when design and quality shine through, it really becomes worth it despite any 'why this figure?"" for first images.<br>",TRUE,3,2,1,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-02-06T20:12:04.357Z","Teddy Bear at his Age?","<p>Set #8827 Sleepyhead: LEGO has proven that they can really design some excellent and interesting new Mini-Figures with these Collectible Mini-Figures Series. Basically this is where you'll find Mini-Figures you won't find in any of their Theme/System Sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sleepyhead is a unique looking and brand new style of Mini-Fig introduced here, much like the Musketeer or the Royal Buckingham Guard he is impressive and isn't something you'd find in an ordinary set. My question though is this, what precisely is he meant to be? He doesn't come with the shorter legs to make him a kid, but he's carrying a teddy bear. (A brand new unique piece that will be a great reason for getting this particular Mini-Fig.) Not many teenagers carry teddy bears around either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My belief is, due to the nature of his fully exhausted yawning print, that this Mini-Figure represents a newly instated father. That's right, he's carrying a teddy bear because his infant is crying in the other room and wants their father to comfort them. (Or change their diaper/feed them.) This Mini-Fig is a new father, that's my stand on it and you can choose to adopt it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this Mini-Figure is definitely a good one and you won't be dissapointed, he's got a fabulous set of PJs printed on his torso, legs, arms and even the back of his torso. He includes a great new hair piece (LEGO sure knows how to introduce new parts.) And of course the teddy bear is a perfect addition to your LEGO Mini-Fig accessories. Plus the very tired looking facial print, plus the second side with the sleeping expression are great. Do yourself a favor and try to get him.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5
"BeardedCastleGuy","2012-02-23T18:31:29.597Z","Solid design but also middle of the road design.","The Sleepyhead Minifigure is a solid if hardly inspired design.<br><br>This Minifigure has extensive printing, including the Front and back of the torso, the arms, and both the front and sides of the legs.&nbsp; Both the hairpiece and the teddybear are new.&nbsp; The teddybear is interesting in both it's appearance is done well and that it's on the large end of the scale for accessory pieces in the Collectable Minifiure series.&nbsp; Also new is the double sided head used to display either a sleeping face or one showing a yawn.<br><br>Definitely one to have as it helps provide some variety, but few people will want or need more than one.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-09T18:50:47.273Z","BEST IN THE SERIES!","<p>The third figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Sleepyhead. This was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting this figure off, we have that spiky hair piece. Believe it or not, this&nbsp;was new for the&nbsp;figure. I&#39;ve always loved that hair, and I like that it&#39;s new to the figure even more. It&#39;s extremely fitting for the figure, with the dishevelled, messy design, and the colour it&#39;s caste in is really awesome as well. Overall, I really love that piece a heck of a lot.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is equally amazing. I adore that yawning expression, and I don&#39;t know that we ever got a yawning expression since this figure. If we have, they&#39;re very far and few between. So that face is extremely awesome, and would&#39;ve worked for the figure greatly. But this figure actually has an alternate expression, which is a cute, sleeping face. Once again, that looks extremely awesome, and we don&#39;t have too much sleeping expressions. Overall, those face prints are incredible, and that head is my favourite head in the series.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms, which are once again, amazing. The torso has the best pajama design for a yellow minifigure ever, in my opinion. The white lines with the button-up design work really well together, and the pockets and wrinkles add a lot to the design. And what&#39;s also incredible is that he has some amazing arm printing. I love that so much! And he even has more white lines on the back of his torso! Man,I love his torso and his arms!</p>

<p>Next are his legs, which have more outstanding printing. The white lines on the front is incredible, but he even has white lines on the sides! That&#39;s just so awesome!</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his teddy bear, which I think was new to this figure. That&#39;s an adorable piece, and the moulding on it is great, with the ears and the little snout, even down the arms and legs. The printing on it is great as well, with the peach-coloured tummy.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, this is my favourite in the series. Every part of him is revolutionary, from both his new and amazing pieces, to the incredible and impressive printing on his head, his torso, and his legs. I mean man, this is an incredible figure, and once again, he&#39;s my favourite in the series, giving him a big 5 out of 5. So that&#39;s it for this review, and thanks for reading!</p>
