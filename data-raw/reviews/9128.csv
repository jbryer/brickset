There is one new piece included which is lovely and there is another piece which I think you might be impressed at...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hat is brand new and is great. It is mainly white but has a sort of bluish tint to it which makes it look very realistic. It is quite a large piece and obscures the back of the figure's head.</p><p>The face is nice, but I think Lego missed an opportunity. The face shows a woman (you can tell by the eyelashes) wearing a protective face mask with four straps just like real surgeons do! I wish however that they had&nbsp;included&nbsp;another face on the other side of her without her mask on, the hat would have obscured it so there seems to be no reason why they didn't include a double sided face. Never mind though, what we do get is very nice.</p><p>The torso is mainly blue and has a surgeon's uniform printed on it. There is a white shirt showing around her neckline. There are lots of creases in her shirt which look very good and add some detail. She is wearing white gloves so she doesn't contaminate anything.</p><p>Her legs are just plain old blue with no printing.</p><p>She carries two accessories which is good. She has a grey syringe in one hand and in the other a new X-ray tile which is very good indeed. It is made by starting with a translucent blue two by two tile, and then printing a skeleton torso on top of that. I am glad they used a Lego skeleton torso rather than using an image of an actual human one which would not look as good in my opinion. Best of all about this piece however is the detail of a broken rib, in the bottom right corner of the ribcage you can see a little crack where the bone is broken.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would advise you to purchase one of these as it is a very useful character for putting in your Lego city's hospital and the X-ray piece alone is worth the price you pay. The Minifigure is not anything very special though so I am going to limit the score to...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"AETerry","2012-03-27T19:19:26.847Z","Surgeon Minifigure Review","With so many excellent and stellar minifigures in Series 6, the Surgeon, when you first hear it's in the line up, seems to fall flat. After all, a medical minifigure by way of the Nurse from Series 1 has already been done. And this one is female as well. And comparing it to other concepts done, it would seem to still fall short, especially of the more fantastical ones and those that haven't been done or touched on before.<br><br>That said, the Surgeon minifigure is still an excellent one to get. LEGO comes through with it on the design and printing of the torso for operating scrubs and the head having a surgeon's mask. Plus, you do get another syringe piece where there seems to be too few of this accessory piece. Other winning pieces for this set are the head covering for the Surgeon and the clear tile piece for the X-Ray she's carrying.<br><br>So not just in terms of collectibility for the level of detail and quality is this figure worth it, but she's a must have for anyone who has any Hospital sets and looking to build MOCs using a Surgeon character. While I first thought this figure wouldn't be worth it and one of the lack luster ones in the lot for Series 6, she turns out to be an excellent figure and a welcomed addition to my collection and City/Town theme.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,5,4
"tkettle9719","2012-04-07T10:09:12.21Z","Like a Surgeon","<p>I got this set a few weeks ago at the Lego Store nearest me, along with the auto mechanic (if you're curious about the time frame in which I actually got the two minifigs, consult the auto mechanic review), and I have found a nice little adoring for this minifigure. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- X-ray image is a total win for me, as is the syringe; you never can go wrong with Lego and various medical item pieces.<br></li><li>- The overall pukey, light blue pattern on the scrubs is excellent, and the stereoscopically accurate minifig factor gets a perfect score.<br></li><li>- I'm also liking the hat thing going on here; it just looks cool, and one day will find a home in a custom MOC minifig. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- The hat is a bit too light for my taste; I don't watch many medical dramas, and therefore don't know if it should be this light, but it looks off to me. <br></li><li>- I'm also not a fan of the eyelashes; for some reason, it shows that the surgeon is female. I wish that it could have had no eyebrows, and thus given the surgeon a neutral look. <br></li><li>- I also am a bit disappointed by the face because, although it would be highly impossible to get the mask on, it still isn't good for custom minifigs. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent set by all means. The overall stereotypical scrubs work well here, and the accessories rock. If anybody can make a Lego coughing mask for this minifig, then it would be nearly perfect. Therefore, I recommend this fig to all.<br></p><p><br></p><p>P.S.- Someone should use this figure for a Lego ""Like a Surgeon"" music video. That'd be super amazing. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-21T02:13:00.25Z","GREAT FIGURE!!!","<p>The eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Surgeon. This was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that amazing hat piece, and that was new to the figure. And wow, I literally love that piece, for so many reasons. The first reason is that it just looks visually great. The various ruffles around it are impressive, and I love how it actually conceals the back of the head. Another reason I like it is because&nbsp;it&#39;s useful for not only a surgeons cap, but also a shower cap, maybe a hairnet, and probably other things. And another thing I love is the colour it&#39;s caste in, which is that light blue colour. Overall, that piece is brilliant, but it isn&#39;t even my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>The next part of the figure is that head piece, and obviously, it&#39;s my favourite part of the figure. Obviously. It&#39;s a bit unfortunate that she has those eyelashes because it limits the use a little, but still, it&#39;s a darn mask. You can probably guess that I&#39;m writing this review in the end of the pandemic, so the mask on this figure is downright great. I really love how the mask is white, and that makes it a bit easier to fit into various scenarios. But all around, that print is extremely useful, and I just love it so much. On second thought, I might like that hat piece better, but the face is definitely an amazing piece. She has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which has a fantastic print. It has some really nice ruffles all over it, and the detail on the collar is pretty nice. The white shirt underneath is a very nice touch, and the white gloves are really cool as well. Plus, the colour of the scrubs is great, being that blue-green colour. But it does stink how she has those curve lines look decent, but I wish they weren&#39;t there, as it really does limit the use of that torso. She has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, and they don&#39;t have printing, but the colouring of it is fantastic in blue-green. It&#39;s a bit uncommon as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, she does include two accessories. The first one is that syringe, which is a fantastic piece to get. The detail all over it is fantastic, and, though it was not new for the figure, it looks really fantastic. The colouring of it is that grey colour, which I believe is a little uncommon. I don&#39;t get why she has a syringe, though. It&#39;s actually a bit funny to be honest, that she just has a random syringe. But I can&#39;t really complain much, as it does look pretty fantastic. She also has that 2x2 tile with the x-ray print on it. I love the consistency of having the LEGO skeleton printed on it, and it&#39;s proportionately accurate to a real LEGO Minifigure. You can actually shine a light through it to make it glow on walls or even LEGO bricks, which is cool. Overall, her accessories are both great.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, the design of the hat, face, torso, and even legs and accessories are all really fantastic. The hat and face are very useful outside the setting, and the torso is pretty useful, as is her accessories. All in all, this is not only executed splendidly, but it&#39;s a really original idea. I really wish we would get a male doctor or nurse in a CMF Series, and a gender swap of a surgeon would be great as well. But I&#39;m not slacking on this figure either, as the design of her is extremely awesome. And while I don&#39;t think she&#39;s my favourite in the series, darn, she&#39;s close.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for the figure! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
