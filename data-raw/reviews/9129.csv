This is without a doubt the worst Minifigure from Series 6, I mean it isn't bad, but there is no real reason the buy the figure, there is nothing new about it and I think they could have chosen a better&nbsp;character&nbsp;to create, despite this I will try to be kind...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair is probably the best bit frankly, it is the same as that of the Nurse from Series 1 but in black. That alone would make it unique but this hairpiece also has a pink streak across the fringe which is a bit different.</p><p>Her face is fairly plain, she has a big grin and some pink lipstick.</p><p>Her torso is quite detailed, she is wearing a black hoodie with a skull wearing a little bow on the front of it. I am getting mixed messages here, a skull wearing a bow? She has pink and black striped arms and some back printing of stitching on her jacket.</p><p>Her legs are mainly black with some printing of studs and pockets. They look alright, but perhaps a bit unfinished.</p><p>She has a skateboard which is white and has some printing on it. Again I am getting mixed messages as at one end is a pink star with a skull in it, and at the other a heart with bat wings. It looks decent enough but is not very interesting.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>You can pass on this figure really, but as a&nbsp;completest&nbsp;myself, it has to be bought in the end. It is really just about as boring as a Collectable Minifigure gets in my opinion, but maybe she could be of some use in a Lego City MOC or something like that, perhaps as an&nbsp;accompaniment for the other Skater figures released previously.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 5/10</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,5,5

She has black striped arm printing, and has a pink print on her hair. She also has a torso front-and-back print and also&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;print. The thing I don't&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;like about this&nbsp;figure&nbsp;is that it&nbsp;looks&nbsp;rather dull.... Maybe, a little more colour?<div>The skateboard has a print of a skull face inside a black and pink star, and also has a heart print inside bat wings.</div><div>Overall this figure would be 3/5 even though it has arm printing.&nbsp;</div><div>That is&nbsp;basically&nbsp;the review!</div>",FALSE,3,5,1,4,5
"AETerry","2012-03-28T14:26:05.7Z","Skater Girl Review","I'll be honest. I personally do love the Skater Girl, I love the detailing she's got, the printing on her torso with the skull and then stripped pattern for her arms. And the hair piece with the stripe of purple in it. I also love the design of the new skate board. I like her and enjoyed finding and getting a few of this minifigure. It's more female minifigures to work with in my MOCs and designs and collection.<br><br>That said, LEGO pushed it real close to being a complete failure with this minifigure. And the reasoning for that is there's already been a couple of other Skate Boarder minifigures done. And this third figure, is redundant and possibly close to being too soon for another minifigure of this concept. Even if it is a female version. I appreciate that some minifigures have seen male and female counterparts come out. On one hand, that can be good for contrast. But it marks close a problem of LEGO possibly not able to have enough ideas and design concepts for minifigures in the Collector line.<br>",TRUE,3,2,1,4,3

"sideswinger","2021-04-21T15:23:40.26Z","a GOOD FIGURE!","<p>The twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Skater Girl. This was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that hair piece, which I actually really love. First off, it just fits the figure really well, and the detail on the piece isn&#39;t that bad. Plus, the black colour looks fantastic on her. But the best part of the hair is that purple highlight in it, which is exclusive to the figure, and it makes the figure so much cooler. It&#39;s a small detail that fits the figure really nicely.</p>

<p>Next is her face, and I just love that expression. The purple makeup around the eyes and eyelashes looks great, and her big smile makes me like the figure even more. She has some purple lipstick around her mouth, and it makes the whole face much more fitting for the figure and the character. She has no alternate expression, which is okay.</p>

<p>Next is her torso and arms, which both are incredible. The sweater she&#39;s wearing is really cute, with that LEGO skeleton head, and I kind of wish LEGO would release a real sweater with that design. Nonetheless, the pockets and even the tighteners on top both add to the design. She has some excellent back torso printing as well, being that black hood. And then her arms have those really amazing black lines, and the black and purple stripes on them add a lot to the figures design, and they are a bit useful as well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which, surprisingly, have some very nice printing. That shiny silver belt design is a really great touch added to the figure, and she even has some pocket printing, which is a really unnecessary but definitely appreciated detail.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessory, which is of course her skateboard. The tires are nothing special, and they are just plain black. However, the printing on the skateboard itself is really great, and the gothic decals on it fit the figure so well, and I just love the gothic stereotype of this entire figure. The skateboard is caste in white as well, so all in all, it&#39;s a fantastic accessory.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, I&#39;ve always liked this figure, but I didn&#39;t know just how much I liked it until I took a closer look. The purple and black colour scheme of her is fantastic, and the printing on all of her pieces is nice. And if you were wondering, this is a gender swap of the Series 1 Skater, and while that figure is pretty good, I like this one a lot better. And I&#39;m actually gonna give this figure a 5 out of 5. But that&#39;s it for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
