There are two new parts which are both exclusive and both very useful, there is a great deal of detail too which improves the Minifigure even more. Anyway, let's get down to business...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair is brand new and is absolutely incredible! It is black and&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;styled after that famous haircut of the 1950s and 60s, the Pompadour (made famous by Elvis Presley). It is an absolutely brilliant&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of the haircut and would of course be perfect for an Elvis Minifigure.</p><p>The head is decent with a very wide grin and some oil splatters around his cheeks.</p><p>The torso is very highly detailed, it has a blue bomber jacket with an open neck printed on it. Beneath the jacket his shirt is visible, it is white with a bit of stitching and some more oil splatters. The jacket has two&nbsp;breast&nbsp;pockets&nbsp;and&nbsp;a badge which says 'Raph' on it, presumably his name. On the other side he has an image of a spanner with flames coming from it. All over this jacket he has oil splatters as well.</p><p>His legs are dark blue with some printing on them, of more oil splashes and some patches.</p><p>He has two accessories, a grey wrench which is a nice inclusion and a brand new red toolbox, which is fairly detailed and looks quite realistic.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would say this figure is worth purchasing, mostly for the hairpiece and the toolbox, but as a whole the figure is good. It might lack a bit in&nbsp;playability&nbsp;but if you have the city garage sets from a couple of years ago then this figure would go nicely with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-02-03T20:16:54.73Z","Go Greased Lightnin'!","<p>Set #8827 Mechanic: This Mini-Fig is a great looking figure, best of all his hairdo makes him look like John Travolta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mechanic has a great looking dark blue color for his uniform, the coloring while unique does make the printing (a stellar looking pocket coverd jumpsuit with oil stains.) difficult to make out even in bright light. The facial print on the figure has a big smile and more oil stains, the Mechanic is hard at work fixing up something. He includes two unique and fun looking accessories, while the wrench is common place in many LEGO City sets, this Mechanic is using a new rare colored version in light gray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's also carrying a red toolbox piece (such a bright red and a fun looking brick, I half expect to see a Binford Tools on it someplace.), overall I'd have to say this little dude is one of the better selections from Series 6. The only complaint is that the dark coloring of his torso makes it a little tricky to notice all the wonderful detail the printing gives.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"BRICKBOY74","2012-04-09T17:31:36.913Z","I like it alot but you probaly won't","<p>I think this is a GREAT minifig. Lucky for me it is common to get .....</p>
<p>Building experience: 2 because the tool box is hard to put on 'cause it gets in the way of the stud of the stand. Plus it took like 3 seconds, it's a minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts: The quality of the wrench was low but I like the color. The tool box is great, it ataches to studs, It has lid deatails and hinges ( not real working&nbsp;gust a mold). I like the hair a little, but you can see the small line were the head curves up. The torso has a nice print of the name tag it says Ralf. The pants&nbsp; I didn't know it had oil stains, but when i did see them they were disapointing the color was to light on the pants to be noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability: Great if you have a city that needs a mechanic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money: The price is high but I got it as a gift. For someone else I think it would be okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: I think this is a great set. I'm glad I got it ...... but It is a bad value to some AFOLS. (P.s new kids that means Adult Fan Of Lego. I had trouble with that and MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love it but sorry if I'm being negative on this one.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
"AETerry","2012-03-30T15:12:41.683Z","Mechanic Review","The Mechanic surprisingly ends up being one of my top favorites out of Series 6. He's well detailed with the printing on his face of oil or grease stains along with his torso and legs for the mechanic coveralls he's wearing and the stains on them. It's a defininte 50's feel to the minifigure with the styling of hair piece given him. I almost can't wait to see if LEGO does a minifigure of Elvis in using this piece. Completing out the character and concept is the silver wrench he's holding. Many long time LEGO fans and collectors have this piece in black but this is first time seeing it in silver. The other accessory piece complementing this figure is the red tool box he's carrying. In all, this is a welcome addition and I can see taking advantage of this figure for many MOC and build ideas.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,5,5
"tkettle9719","2012-03-25T10:18:20.12Z","The terror of the auto mechanic!","<p>I got this set yesterday at a local Lego store. I opened it, and suddenly realized what I got: the Lego embodiment of my evil neighbor, who loves to hate anything about children. The only difference: the minifigure is smiling. Even more terrifying. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The new hair piece is cool, retro. It reminds me a lot (for some reason) of Grease, the John Travolta character. <br></li><li>-There are multiple accessories (different ones) that this character has, such as the toolbox and the actual wrench. Quite nice. <br></li><li>-Face has nice detail, what with the smear of oil on it. The clothes also have a bit of smear on them. I just love detailing. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The smearing of the oil should be more abundant; it should show that he has actually worked a lot.&nbsp; <br></li><li>-I like the name tag idea, but I don't like that they put an actual name on it; scribbles would have been a better choice, or poor cursive. <br></li><li>-Also, the tool box could be a lot smaller, so as to make the figure more realistic. <br></li></ul>
<p>What a terrifyingly unique minifigure. It's a cool, retro style minifig that can help create your 60s or 70s town, and can help bring it a modernized Lego design. Therefor, I recommend this figure. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"middleton83","2013-02-03T14:16:18.323Z","The mechanic and his tools","This was the first collectible minifigure I got and and have loved them since. Of course I don't get them all that often becuase of there price.<br><br>The overall rating is 4/5, this will become obivous by the end of&nbsp; the review.<br><br>Building experience: 1/5, The reason behind this is becuase it is just a minifigure and therefore there is very little to build, which is what is expected from a collectible minifigure.<br><br>Parts: 5/5, This is because it comes with parts that you would not find in a normal set, the hair piece I don't particularly like, but the tool box and spanner are lovely and as far as I know are not found in any other sets, the body pieces and face are also good and work really well for a mechanic. I would say that all the parts are good for an MOC.<br><br>Playability: 3/5, This is becuase it can be put in a garage MOC or in a lego city and work as a mechanic there, but other than that, their isn't really much you can do with the mechanic.<br><br>Value for money: 2/5, This is becuase it is Â£1.99 in the UK and therefore is quite expensive, but it's what your getting that's important, usually requires luck getting the one you want, or...... a lot of money.<br><br>Finally you can see why I rated it 4/5 overall. Personally I think if you could add a wheel near him, it would look good as it would at first impressions distinguish him as a mechanic.<br>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,2
"Master_Wu","2019-09-02T18:35:12.737Z","Looks great!","<p>If you are a fan of Lego, and of minifigures, you might want to look into the mechanic! This guy is just loaded with details: his pants are stained with patches of oil and so are his shirt and face! His jackets bears some logos and some white stitching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the back has no printing, but overall, tool chest in hand, this minifigure is fit for anyone who likes Lego minifigures!</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-22T20:28:08.15Z","BEST LEGO MECHANIC!","<p>The fifteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Mechanic. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that really fantastic spiky hair piece, and it was actually new to the figure. I love when LEGO gives us new pieces when it&#39;s totally unnecessary, and we see that here. A mechanic didn&#39;t need a new hair piece, and the fact that LEGO gave us a new piece anyway is extremely appreciated and welcome. The piece itself is great as well. I love how big it is, and the spike on top looks fine. It also has some hair moulding in it all around, which is great. I like how it has those&nbsp;side-burns on the sides as well. It&#39;s just a great piece.</p>

<p>Next is the face, and I really love the printing on it. The big smile is great, but what I really love is how he has those oil splatters on his cheeks. Those really add to the design and make the fact that it&#39;s a mechanic pretty obvious, which is great. The face could be used as a Gardener or something as well. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and the printing on it is really fantastic, and it screams mechanic to me. I love the dark blue colouring, and the various oil stains on it really add a lot to the overall figure. The pockets on it, as well as the white stitching are nice touches, and even the little patches on the top of it are great. He has that white undershirt as well, and I like the button up design. He has no back printing on it, which stinks. It would&#39;ve been nice to have gotten more oil stains, but oh well.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, and this is kind of an inconsistent figure. The legs have some great printing, but then he doesn&#39;t have back torso printing. But anyway, the legs are very nice, and I just love the grease and oil stains on them. Like the hair piece, he didn&#39;t need leg printing, and the fact that LEGO printed them just goes above and beyond.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his two accessories, and the first one is that light grey wrench. That piece isn&#39;t that special at all, but it&#39;s extremely fitting, so I love the inclusion. The light grey colour it&#39;s caste in is very nice and slightly uncommon as well. He also has that toolbox, which is once again, a fantastic inclusion. It isn&#39;t that special, and the red colouring isn&#39;t rare or anything, but the piece itself is just an extremely fitting accessory, and I like both the toolbox and the wrench.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, this figure is great, and it&#39;s long overdue for the world of CMF&#39;s. This is just my favourite LEGO mechanic minifigure, and it&#39;s just a perfect, typical mechanic figure. All his pieces are fantastic, and they all have such great printing, though he lacks back printing. Still, all in all, this is one pretty great figure, and I&#39;m gonna be giving him a 4 out of 5. And that&#39;s it for this review! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
