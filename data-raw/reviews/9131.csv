Almost everything...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hat is one of the new pieces, similar to the sailor hat from Series 4 it is slanted to one side on his head, just like a real traditional butcher would have it. It is totally white and I quite like it!</p><p>The face as I mentioned earlier is brilliant, he is quite smiley and has ginger eyebrows. But best of all, he has ginger muttonchops which are a wonderful touch I think.</p><p>The torso has a blue striped apron and a white shirt. Around his neck he is wearing a red bow tie which is nice as it is greatly reminiscent of a traditional butcher.</p><p>His legs have a continuation of the apron printed on them which fits just perfectly with the apron on his torso.</p><p>The&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;are the best bit though as with several of the other Minifigures from this series. He carries a brand new T-bone piece which is nice as it is very realistic with the bone and fatty areas on the meat itself, and a brand new meat cleaver which is not only good for the butcher, but also good for making a serial killer or&nbsp;assassin, no murderer&nbsp;is complete without a meat cleaver!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In summary I would say, while not a must have figure, this is still very good and if you can get him, do. But what is wrong with the figure? I said he was almost perfect, what is the problem? Well he needs more detail, simple as that. His torso is not great and just needs some small details added to it. Still he will fit nicely into you Lego city, although sadly he does not have a butchers shop to work in at the moment, never mind, you will have to build one yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is one awesome figure!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The butcher is the figure I have been trying to get since series 6 came out!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parts: Well, he includes some awesome parts. His hat is new, and it kind of slants to one side.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cool part he has is a cleaver. If you are good at feeling things, then you should probably try &nbsp; feeling for the cleaver cause it is flat. Then last but not least, as you could probably tell from my title,&nbsp;the best piece is the T-BONE STEAK! It is quite superb, major details, including the t-bone in the &nbsp;middle and the red core! He also has a nice torso and legs, along with his butcher&nbsp;expression. The&nbsp;sideburns also really bring it out.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Building experience: Not exactly much to say about the building experience, just your typical figure&nbsp;build with hat and stuff to hold.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Playability: &nbsp;Well, yes, he&#39;s definitely&nbsp;playable! He can be used as a cook, or you can use the t-bone steak and the cleaver to make creations (Star Wars, city, castle, etc.)</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Value for money: Maybe be a little overpriced, ($0.70 would be 10 cents a piece which is probably what&nbsp;these sets should be priced at) $3.00 seems a little bit much, but still well worth the money!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Overall rating: Well I have got to say, He&#39;s a fantastic minifig! So he&#39;s got to be a 5/5! Anybody who&nbsp;likes to collect figures should get the butcher for sure!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-02-09T13:14:42.513Z","The Butcher, the Baker and...","<p>Set #8827 Butcher: Series 6 is a consistant slam dunk from LEGO, the Collectible Mini-Figs are getting better and better as time progresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Butcher includes some fun new pieces and a great looking old-time print, he's got a great white torso with a dark blue apron with white stripes printed down his body and over his legs. In fact this is one of the few prints that is printed over the waist piece, he also has a great little red bowtie on his shirt print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He includes two accessories, a butcher's cleaver and a piece of steak on a bone, this bone is a bit longer than you'd probably find on a real piece of steak, but I'm not sure on that as I haven't ever seen one before outside of the grocery store after the butcher's had a chance to cut it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last, but not least, he's wearing a fun looking little paper style butcher's hat. And includes two side-burns on his facial print. Overall I'd have to say, while I wasn't very impressed with him when I first got him out of the package, because I got two of them in one purchase. However he's grown on me and I'm glad I got two of him, if only for the peice of steak alone. You'd do well to try and get a few more for the unique pieces, now LEGO how about finishing up the triumvirate with a Baker and a Candle Stick Maker so the nursery rhyme can be finished.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"GeluNumber1","2012-01-22T19:37:40.087Z","Good Ol' Butcher","<p>I found this guy at my local TRU. I only had money for one, so I grabbed a random pack. Lo and behold, this guy was in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening: In&nbsp;the car or at home, the bag can either be cut open or simply ripped apart. When you do, 7 pieces spill out.</p>
<p>The parts: The butcher comes with all-new parts, excluding the base. He has a white, tilted hat reminiscent of the paper hats actual buthcers have. He has a silly grin with some cool muttonchops. His torso is a standard whit minifigure piece with a small, red tie and a blue smock covering the rest. His legs continue the smock theme, and are otherwise white. He holds a silver butcher knife in his left and a piece of choice meat in his right.</p>
<p>The build: It's quick and simple. You probably know how to do it.</p>
<p>Playability: Although the butcher is a small, he can certainly liven up a diorama. He'll fit in any city scene or set, and look natural. Place him by himself, though, and he'll look out of place. Still, that won't be too much of a problem.</p>
<p>Overall: I recommend him if you&nbsp; want to complete your collection, want good parts, or want to add soemone to a city diorama. He wasn't high on my list of figures to get, but&nbsp;now I like him very much!</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-22T17:43:58.757Z","a great, ORIGINAL figure!","<p>The fourteenth figure in the LEGO Mini figures Series 6 is the Butcher. This figure was release din 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that chef hat, which isn&#39;t anything all too special. I like the piece, though, as it does fit the figure extremely well. Plus, the piece itself is pretty cool in design, with the pointy ends, and the smooth top. Now I don&#39;t know if it was new for the figure, and if it was, that&#39;s great, and if not, it still looks great on the figure, so it&#39;s cool either way.</p>

<p>Next is his face, and I really love the printing&nbsp;it has. The smile is good, but my favourite part is the reddish-brown sideburns. They really fit the figure to me, and they&#39;re extremely useful outside the figure. We don&#39;t have sideburn printing on minifigures too often, so seeing them here is very welcome.&nbsp;He has no alternate facial expression, but that&#39;s good, since it&#39;d be horribly exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, and the printing on front of it is fantastic. He has blue and white stripes on that apron, and I love how there are some wrinkles printed onto it as well. He has that red bow-tie underneath as well, and it&#39;s a very fitting torso overall. He has no back torso printing, which does sort of&nbsp;stink. I guess it could possibly be excused since some&nbsp;aprons don&#39;t technically cover the back, but some aprons DO cover the back, and seeing more blue and white stripes at the back would definitely be appreciated. But oh well.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, and the printing on them is pretty great. I love how the apron design carries on to the legs, and I like how the part between his legs has a white stripe on it, which shows how seamless the apron design is. He has no side leg printing, and the apron actually cuts off at the sides to avoid side printing. That&#39;s a little sad, but I can get over it, since it can technically be accurate to real aprons in some cases.</p>

<p>Lastly are his two accessories, both of which are really great. The first one is that butchers knife, and I believe it was new to the figure. I love that piece, with the handle, and I like how smooth the tip of the blade is. His second accessory was also new to the figure, and oh my; I LOVE that steak! The handle is in a really nice place, and the bone on the bottom of the handle is accurate to a real LEGO bone piece. I love how the top of the steak curves, and the dark red printing on it really adds a lot, and it really makes it look like a steak. There&#39;s printing on both sides as well, which is a really fantastic touch. I really like both accessories.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, the design of this figure is fantastic. I think this figure is one of my favourites of the series, and I really love all 6 pieces on the figure. The printing on the face, torso, legs, and steak is all great, as is the pieces without printing, being the hat and knife. I think the concept of having a butcher CMF figure is really original, and overall, 5 out o 5 for me. But that&#39;s all for this figure! Thank you for reading this very long review!</p>
