"CapnRex101","2011-12-28T14:38:13.283Z","8827 (9) - Intergalactic Girl","<p>This is a figure which falls into the lower tier of Collectable Minifigures for this series. It is not a terrible figure, it lacks anything unique about it though which makes it simply underwhelming. Nevertheless, I will endeavour to focus on the positive which is the playability. This Minifigure looks lovely next to the Spaceman from Series 1 and can of course fight against the evil aliens which we have seen in Series 3 and 6.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair is one of my favourite things about the figure, it is not a new mould, being the same as that of the Pop Star among others, but is in a new colour. It looks good in blonde and perfectly compliments any female Minifigure which you might have.</p><p>The face is interesting with a smirk, eyelashes and some very futuristic silver lipstick!</p><p>The torso is fairly nicely detailed and is pink, very pink! Much like the Spaceman she has a homage to the old space logo on her torso and a lot of pipes and grills. There is no back printing which is a shame. She also has a silver belt.</p><p>Her legs are&nbsp;also&nbsp;pink and printed with padding and some kind of&nbsp;knee-pads&nbsp;which are silver. She also printing on her feet which is a nice touch.</p><p>She comes with two accessories, a helmet and a laser gun. The laser gun is a slightly darker silver than in the past and has a short blue blade to represent the laser. The helmet is the same bright pink as the rest of her and is the same mould as the Spaceman again! It has a blue translucent visor which must be removed for her to hold the helmet, which is annoying.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Basically, you can afford to pass this one up, but as a bit of a&nbsp;completest&nbsp;myself I had to get it. If you want the complete set then I would advise you to purchase this one of course, if your Spaceman from Series 1 is looking lonely then buy it, but otherwise, look for others first, however, this figure is worth having.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 6/10</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,5

She fits in with any lego space collection but works best with the adu.<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Now the figure is well designed but i would like some back printing, the pink coloration is great and so are the details, and the hair is very nice (that and her smirk in my opinion makes her look like penny from the big bang theory one of the best tv shows ever) and the silver lipstick is a nice touch. So if you like space you should get this mini figure especially if you have adu or need a girl in your space set</div>",FALSE,5,4,2,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-02-09T20:03:12.027Z","PIGS IN SPACE!","<p>Set #8827 Intergalactic Girl: Despite what my title for this review implies I am not going to say that this Mini-Fig is bad, or not worth your time to track down. I am however going to make the obvious comparison and say that with the right custom head piece you could easily MOC your very own LEGO Miss Piggy with her pink spacesuit from the old Pigs in Space sketch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Intergalactic Girl Mini-Fig may be one of the plainer Mini-Figs from Series 6, however I still find she's got a decent look to her. Her space suit is pink and has a similar (read Feminine) look to it as the Series 1 Spaceman Mini-Fig It has the same Classic Space logo on the chest print, but she doesn't have a breathing apparatus printed on her torso, and her back unfortunately doesn't seem to have any printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her legs though do have some printing, completing the look of the space suit, she's wearing medium stone gray gloves (to use LEGO's name for the color) and she's carrying a different colored space raygun piece with a blue 'laser beam'. Her facial print is smart and sassy and includes silver lipstick, silver, that's the first time LEGO has used any other color for lipstick than red (or the slightly rarer green found on some Mini-Figs). Her head would look good on other Mini-Fig torsos for MOCers out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has a pink helmet with transparent visor or swappable blonde hair, I don't know if it has been seen before in the Collectible Mini-Figures Series. Overall I'd have to say that Series 6 has been full of great looking Mini-Figs and you can't truly go wrong with any of them, although if you're not too big on Female Mini-Figs you may want to skip this one.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-04T13:56:53.003Z","A woman in a man's universe.","If you want to know a little bit more about the inherent gender bias present in the LEGO universe, perhaps one needs to go no further than to investigate the demographics of the Minifig population: with few exceptions (<a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sp017"">Ice Planet</a> comes to mind), Space has been thoroughly dominated by a hegemony of men. It's hard to say if the gender imbalance is worse in Space or in Castle, but let's just say that Space is not going to be winning any awards for diversity at the workplace. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Now along comes Intergalactic Girl, who, for some reason, instantly brought to mind images of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarella_(film)""><i>Barbarella</i></a>, although that might have more to do with the emotional scarring that that movie brought me than any resemblance between the titular character and Intergalactic Girl. All the same, there is a point to be made here: there is a difference between a ""spacewoman"" as represented by Intergalactic Girl and, say, someone like Ellen Ripley from the <i>Alien</i> series or Trinity in the <i>Matrix </i>movies. I've always felt that, in the latter case, you don't really have a ""strong woman"" character as much as you have a woman doing a man's job. Sure, they kick butt and doesn't afraid of anything, but what does that say about gender roles if the only way to be a strong woman is to act like a man?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Intergalactic Girl is different. Intergalactic Girl brazenly plasters the classic LEGO Space logo onto her torso and is ready to tour the galaxy in her hot pink, charming locals who are willing to be charmed and blasting to pieces anyone else, getting her way via whatever means she deems appropriate. Her blonde hairpiece is pretty unique, as is her alluring smile and silver lipstick. Whatever she's up to, you can tell right away that it's not something a man would be able to do, no sir. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With all the kerfuffle about LEGO Friends being deliberately ""gendered"", Intergalactic Girl is a breath of fresh air. She takes those pinks and purples and sky blues and makes them her own, because that's what she is - a woman. What's wrong with a woman acting like a woman? The gender role is the role that she owns because she's a part of it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, speaking more prosaically, I bought a Collectible Minifig pack completely on a whim without feeling for any parts whatsoever and got her, and I'm pretty pleased. She's very striking and is sure to make any of your self-conscious male space guys feel inadequate. I got a lot of amusement out of Intergalactic girl; hopefully you will too.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,1

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are the same as any other minifig and basically tell you to put the head on the torso and the torso on the legs. I doubt you really need the instructions to build this though.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The gun and helmet each exist out of 2 parts. I really like her blonde hair piece.<br></p><br><h4>The build</h4><p>Had a bit of troubles getting the glass into the helmet, but figured out I had it upside down; small difference, but it matters apparently. <br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>My main problem with this one is that the minifig can barely hold the helmet in her hand. It's possible, but it doesn't make the complete ""click"" in her hands, so it falls out relatively easy. Since the helmet doesn't fit over her hair either, you'll always have a part you cannot fit on the minifig and will have to store elsewhere. </p>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,3
"ninjabiomech","2018-08-23T21:43:27.063Z","Not a bad figure. would recommend.","<p>I liked this figure.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great counterpart to all of the classic space. A pink special ops spaceman (I use this term to the maximum of it&#39;s gender neutralness).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The headpiece is kinda nice. A different colored lipstick face is always welcome.</p>

<p>Hair is pretty useful and nice. It&#39;s a (i think) rare color for this part and is perfect for all sorts of female figures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the torso is not gender neutral and the helmet doesn&#39;t really fit properly into minifig hands.&nbsp; :(</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-21T23:47:55.833Z","I don't LOVE it anymore!","<p>The thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Intergalactic Girl. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 9 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair piece. She does come with that helmet, but I consider it an accessory, so we&#39;re just gonna talk about her hair. It is that Pop Star hair from Series 2 in that really bright yellow colour, which looks simply fantastic. I&#39;ve always really loved that piece, and seeing it in that yellow colour is so great. The wavy moulding on the back, top, and sides all looks awesome, and I just love it in that colour. Overall, I think the hair might be my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is her face, and the face printing on it is great. I love the eyeshadow design, and the blue lipstick looks really space-like, and it has kind of a shiny metallic look. The smirk she has is great, as is the small eyebrows. She has no back expression, but the frontal one is good enough for me.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and I have a bit to say about it. The detail on the front of it is great, and it looks like a typical astronaut, which is good. The classic space logo in the centre, the belt, and even the silver chords around the shoulders all look good. The curve lines are also nice, and of course, the pink on it is fitting. But what really sucks is how she has absolutely no back torso printing, which is just plain awful. I mean it is covered by the hair, but she still needs back printing. One thing that&#39;s both good and bad about the figure is that her arms are caste in a mauve colour. The good thing about it is that it&#39;s an added touch that does add to the detail of the figure. What&#39;s bad about it is that they&#39;re a completely different colour than the torso, and it makes the arms super distracting. I think a normal pink for them would&#39;ve been so much better for the overall figure, and them being a different colour than the torso is just distracting and bothersome. But on the bright side, the black gloves are pretty cool.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, and they have a slight bit of printed detail. The silver chords that carry on from the torso looks good, and I really appreciate the silver shoes.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her two accessories. The first accessory is that ray gun, and oh gosh, that ray gun accessory is severely overused in CMF&#39;s, and it&#39;s kind of a crappy accessory at this point. It fits the figure, but it&#39;s so boring. The colour of the gun itself is just plain grey, and the blast is a translucent blue rod, so both pieces are kind of uninteresting. Her second accessory is good though, being that astronaut helmet. It wasn&#39;t a new part, but it was new to the figure in that pink colour. I love how it has the handle on front, as well as the blue window on front, and it can, of course, be swapped with the hair. But I will say, it looks slightly strange on the figures head, as it covers the mouth. I think it&#39;s meant to be held in her hand.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, I used to be crazy about this figure, and it was one of my favourites in the series, but to be honest, my love of her has slightly waned. I do think she has an excellent hair piece, and her face is alright, but overall, I&#39;m not insane about her. She has issues, like the torsos back and arms, her ray gun, and her helmet. And her idea isn&#39;t exactly that original, being a gender swap of the Series 1 Spaceman, and being one of the many, many space CMF figures from Series 1 to 6. But still, her hair is great. Overall, I&#39;m&nbsp;actually gonna give her 3, as my love of her as waned a bit.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for this figure! Thanks for reading this long review!</p>
