While probably not at the top of the wish list for most people, this is a lovely Minifigure to add to your collection. He is a fun fellow, with a wonderful hat and a brand new piece to make the pot for his gold which make him very unique, so for those reasons I certainly think he is worth purchasing, but I digress, see what you think when you have read the review.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>We will begin with his lovely hat. The mould is identical to that of the classic Lego Bowler hat, but has new printing. The base colour is of course green and around the hat is printed a nice black hat band with a golden buckle. This is a great piece for making the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland, or even the Mad Hatter from Batman if you like!</p><p>The head is about as Irish as it gets, he has a ginger beard, ginger eyebrows, and a cheeky smile, just as any Leprechaun should have.</p><p>The torso again would be great for a Mad Hatter figure or anyone else with a really poor taste in fashion. It sports some very detailed printing including a green bow tie, a dark green waistcoat, a huge gold buckle and even a little three leaf clover!</p><p>The legs are short and green like the rest of him, simple as that!</p><p>Now onto the best bit of the Minifigure, the&nbsp;accessory, he carries a small pot of gold, the pot&nbsp;itself&nbsp;is brand new. It would be great for making a cauldron as it can actually have one of the new bucket handles attached to it if you want! In the pot are three gold studs, which can easily be removed.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a figure which I would recommend. It is&nbsp;charmingly simple and even includes a brand new and exclusive piece! The only small gripe I would have with it would have to be the&nbsp;playability, once&nbsp;you have got your Irish accent perfected and had him cause a bit of mischief, what else can you do? Nevertheless I give the figure...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"AETerry","2012-03-07T15:17:00.167Z","Leprechaun Reivew","The Leprechaun is easily one of my favorite minifigures from Series 6. He, along with the Minotaur and Genie represent a move towards showing the more fantastical and mythological possibilities of the Collectible Minifigure line and what all that LEGO could do with future sets and ideas.<br><br>At $2.99, this particular little figure does indeed feel worth with the amount of detailing and custom accessory piece he's given. From his green molded top had with the black band, his green outfit, the short green legs and printed face of an orange or red beard and his pot of gold holding three pearl gold 1x1 round plates in it for coins.<br><br>This is indeed a wonderful little figure and I'm very pleased to have in my collection of minifigures. Both as display and some MOC ideas that I've got for him.<br>",TRUE,5,3,1,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-22T08:21:16.647Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 6) - Leprechaun Review","This minifig is in my top-3 of this series. The details on his torso and on his top hat are very phenomenal. We also get a pot of gold with this character. What I think is interesting about the pot is that the gold doesn't stick on a stud but I think this is also, because it should be easy to take the 3 golden studs out of that piece.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-05-26T21:59:10.23Z","Darby O'Gil! It is not","<p>Set #8827 Leprechaun: When it comes to LEGO Utilising the shorter leg pieces we often find interesting ideas explored, from Dwarves, Hobbits and Ewoks you can get tons of interesting Minifigures. And then there is the Leprechaun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Minifigures go the Leprechaun isn't too bad, personally I would have preferred to get him last after snagging a Skater Girl and Surgeon among others, he is still an impressively made Minifigure. The top hat piece isn't new, we've seen it before with the Magician from Series 1, the green coloring coupled with the typical black belt and gold buckle has made it a great piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His head sculpt evokes a sense of mischievousness, Leprechauns are notorious for tricking those who try to capture them, and this facial print is very evocative of this trait. He's got a slightly lopsided teeth baring grin/smile on his face, and the little crinkles around his eyes just scream watch out. He's got a light red beard and eyebrows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The torso printing shows off a green bow tie, gold buttons opened on the jacket with a green undershirt of a darker color clearly buttoned up with more gold buttons. And a large gold belt buckle on his waistline. Of course he has the shorty legs in green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pot is a brand new piece, and he also comes with three 1x1 studs to represent gold coins. I actually thought the pot itself was one solid piece with the stud on top to represent the piles of gold he obviously has, was I surprised when this turned out not to be the case. Overall I'd have to say that the Leprechaun is actually a clever use of the shorty legs in giving us Minifigure collectors something slightly more unique than just young kids in LEGO City or Ewoks and Jawas from Star Wars. Still he's one that can be easily skipped if you're not interested in the Irish Folktales. The pot however is one you may wish to track down for your MOC Piece collection, it looks like it would make a great cauldron for a witch Minifigure.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"legohpcity","2012-04-21T07:08:59.817Z","The green Leprechaun","<p>I got this nice little minifigure from series 6 when I bought 5 packages without knowing which minifigures it was. I was quite happy when I got him, and he now stands with my other series 6 figures. But now, let's start the review!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>As I said in my review for the Aerobics Instructor, the box is a plastic bag with nine of the figures from the series on it. It's white.</div><div>The instructions is a piece of paper where they show all of the minifigures from the series. On the back, it's some parts from the series and a minifigure to tell where the parts go on the minifigure.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>When you open the bag and get the Leprechaun, you mostly see green parts. His hat, torso and (small) legs are green. The hat has a band printed on it and it goes around whole the hat! The torso has a suit printed on it, so it's supposed to look like a suit. It has green details on it (like an sort of tie) and also a belt. I suspect that they printed the belt on the torso instead of the legs, because it's probably quite hard to print on short legs! The torso doesn't have a back printing, which is a shame, becaue the minifigure would be better with a back printing! The legs doesn't have any print, but it's good that they used short legs instead of long because it looks more like an Leprechaun with short legs!<br><br>The head is yellow and has an happy face with an orange beard and orange eyebrows on it. Now to the accessories! The Leprechaun comes with a brown pot and three golden coins. I believe that the brown pot is a new mold, which is good. The pot doesn't have a stud on the bottom, which is good, because the coins would be stuck otherwise. It would be better if the coins were more detailed parts than just three golden studs.<br><br>Like all collectable minifigures, the Leprachaun comes with a black stand.</div>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The completed minifigure looks good, but as I said, it would have been better with back printing on the torso and an other thing for the golden coins. But he looks good with the other series 6 minifigures on his black stand.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is VERY easy. Just put the torso on the legs, the head on the torso, the hat on the head, the coins stacked above each other and in the pot, the pot &amp; coins in one hand and then the minifigure on the stand! It's not that hard.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>The minifigure is a good minifigure, but not the best one from series 6. It would have been better with back printing and other things as coins, so that pulls down the rating a little bit. Overall, I give the Leprachaun a rating of 4/5.</div>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"eschosinsky","2012-03-09T11:18:31.703Z","satisfied but...","<div>This Minifig, as many other are a quit detailed piece. &nbsp;His hat and pot are a nice detailed, but I would prefer that it came with the lego detailed coins instead the 1x1 round piece. &nbsp;In order to prevent any loose piece, the 1x1 is the best choice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>overall, I'm very satisfied with it.</div><div><br><div><br></div><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-16T16:34:45.103Z","a really good figure!","<p>The ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Leprechaun. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 9 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that top hat piece. It&#39;s caste in green, which is a fantastic colour for it, and it may even be exclusive to this very day. But even better, he has some epic printing on it. That black band goes around the entire hat giving it a 360 experience, which is incredibly uncommon That gold buckle on the front is a very great touch as well. Overall, that hat is really awesome.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a really great expression, and it&#39;s pretty useful outside the setting. I really love his smile, and the red beard is really awesome looking. I love how it curves up and into the hat, and the red eyebrows are pretty sweet as well. He has no alternate expression, which is great since it&#39;d be severely exposed.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which features some fine printing, and I wanna break it all down. That light green bow on top looks great, and the vest, jacket, and undershirt all have great colours that blend well. The vest is dark green, with some gold buttons printed on it; the jacket has a very nice plain green colour, which is actually the colour the torso itself is caste in; the belt is printed in black, which is accurate to the hat, and it has that big gold belt buckle, which is crucial to the figure, if you ask me; and lastly, he has that white shirt underneath everything. The arms have no printing, but that&#39;s okay. He has no back torso printing either, which is actually pretty sad since his front has so much printing.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which I love the use of small legs. They look great in plain green as well.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessory, which for some reason the image of this figure has no accessory. That&#39;s inaccurate, as the real figure has a pot of gold. The pot for the gold is caste in a reddish-brown colour, which is pretty accurate to typical leprechauns. Inside it is three 1x1 pearl gold studs, which look pretty good inside the pot itself. Overall, it&#39;s a good accessory.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I&#39;ve always liked this figure, but I&#39;ve never loved it. However, I must say, upon taking a better look, I really do love this figure. It&#39;s so accurate to a typical leprechaun, and the printing on all his pieces all look spectacular. So overall, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a solid 4 out of 5. And that&#39;s all for this review! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
