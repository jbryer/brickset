"CapnRex101","2011-12-18T06:40:00.067Z","8827 (11) - Genie","<p>The Genie has always been one to look forward to from this Series, and like the others it does not&nbsp;disappoint. He is clearly based on the interpretation of the Genie that we see in Disney's Aladdin which I think was the best choice as this is his most recognisable form. I am aware that many people were looking forward to seeing how well the magic lamp was pulled off and it is great. Anyway, let's get right onto the review.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The turban is made up of two pieces, a purple piece for the turban itself and then a lovely new gold part with scrolls and a big pink gem which attaches to the front of the turban.</p><p>The head is a light shade of blue and has a toothy grin. It even has the Genie's trademark beard which goes around his chin and all the way up beneath his turban.</p><p>The torso is also nice, with an open purple waistcoat (which has gold buttons) and some sort of gold banding at the waist. This Genie is obviously quite strong as he has some muscles on show too. His arms a light blue and he is wearing gold gloves. I have previously only seen gold hands on the C-3PO Minifigure from Star Wars so this is quite unique.</p><p>The legs, although they are not really legs, are a brand new piece, cast in light blue this wispy magical cloud from which the Genie appears is perfectly executed, it can even fit onto the top of the lamp to recreate the Genie's first appearance!</p><p>The lamp itself however is the best piece. It is a dull gold colour and can either be held by the Genie, or be at his feet as he emerges from it. The stud on top of the lamp allows the Genie to fit on, and this attachment point could be useful for creating vases or anything else which comes to mind.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In essence, this is just a brilliant Minifigure. While not as absolutely exquisite as the Roman, the Genie is one which I would certainly&nbsp;recommend, not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;because&nbsp;of the figure itself, but because of the absolutely sublime magic lamp.&nbsp;There are no faults so I am obliged to award the Genie with...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"AETerry","2012-03-08T12:37:16.63Z","Genie Review","I would have to say that the Genie is one of the must have minifigures out of Series 6. Like the Leprechaun and the Minotaur, he shows LEGO exploring the possibilities of minifigure ideas and concepts with the Mythological and Fantastical.<br><br>The figure is very well detailed and printed. His blue skin is clearly refering to the Disney depiction of the Genie in the movie Alladin. He's got a gold lamp, purple turban with a jewel piece for it. The printing of his purple vest is well done too along with the molding of his lower half that looks all ""smokey"" and coming up out of the lamp.<br><br>At $2.99, it is worth it for these figures, especially when you get something as well done in concept and execution of the idea. I've only been able to get one so far, but hopefully I can at least find and get one or two more before Series 6 is gone and collector prices set in.<br>",TRUE,5,2,1,4,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are my views on the Genie Mini-Fig from Series 6? Good job LEGO, you've made something that will please a lot of kids and adults alike, this Mini-Fig is one of the big ticket draws from Series 6. He has three unique to him Mini-Fig parts, the lower torso (which could be re-used down the line for a Casper or Ghost Mini-Fig.), the new Magic Lamp accessory and I believe a new attachment piece for the turban he's wearing. (I could be mistaken on that front, but it is new to me.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printing on the Genie is great, his torso sadly is only one-sided, but the blue toned flesh and the neat muscled chest look is great. He's also wearing a purple open-chested vest with three gold buttons and a matching colored sash. His hands are gloves of a similar color, they remind me a little of 3PO's hands, and they match the color of his lamp. The turban is purple with a fancy little attachment/accessory that has a purple jewel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really dig this guy, he's one of the ones I was really hoping to get and to get him first instead of something more mundane such as the Intergalactic Girl or one of the other common Mini-Figs is great. I was actually trying for the Minotaur and thought the Turban was actually the Minotaur's head. I was mistaken, and pleasently so. I do have one minor complaint however, it would have been nice if he also included a set of legs so you could alternate between the unique leg piece and then regular legs so he could interact with regular Mini-Figs like the Genie from Aladdin.</p>

<p>Highly Reccomended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,2,4

	It&#39;s worth all the struggle to get it. I spent $20.00 trying to find it. He&#39;s verry easy to build if you can&#39;t find how to Step 1 Put head on boty Step 2 Put legs on boty Step 3 put hat on head Step 4 put lamp on botton or in hand</p>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No bands around his wrists (nit picky thing)&nbsp;</li><li>Golden hands serve no apparent purpose</li></ul>
<p>All in all this is a must-buy minifig. If you miss him while they're out, I would advise buying him on the aftermarket. There are some things you've got to have, and this is one of them.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,3
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-04-06T05:59:25.957Z","...who's next in line for three wishes?","<p>The Genie is one of my favourites from series 6, no question about it. It might even be a tie between Genie &lt;-&gt; Roman Soldier for me. This azure-blue guy is <i>that</i> awesome. I actually had no real expectations with him so I was pleasantly surprised when I got him by accident. I was really looking for the Minotaur but got this great guy instead.</p><div><br></div><h4>Parts.</h4><div>You get all the parts for the body of course:</div><div>- A nice Genie tail/hovering piece which can be used in many ways.&nbsp;</div><div>- The torso has an Oriental printed vest on the front.&nbsp;</div><div>- Headpiece has the mandatory cunning Genie smile, and a very familiar beard.</div><div>- To top it off, you get an amazing turban with a gem.</div><div>- It wouldn't be complete without a lamp. The lamp is a great piece to have, even multiples of.</div><div><br></div><div>Everything is carefully printed to enhance the details on this minifig. LEGO has done a swell job (again). The colour combinations with purple, gold and azure-blue is a total win.</div><h4><br></h4><h4>The minifigure.</h4><div>Images don't really do the Genie justice. You will have to pick him up for yourself to really appreciate the details. The Genie has so many possibilities and can be the crossover minifigure you have been waiting for. City LEGO characters can find the lamp (which btw, fits PERFECTLY either in a minifigs hand or to place on the Genie's ""leg"" piece on) unexpectantly in a museum, or you can use the Genie in your <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Prince%20of%20Persia"">Prince of Perisia</a> collection/play -where he will fit right in. There is no end to the possibilities, really.</div><div><br></div><div>As many already have mentioned, he actually looks a lot like a certain Genie from Aladdin. If you place him on the lamp it sort of looks like he has been summoned by someone, similar to what happened to Aladdin.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It also makes the figure display friendly for mere collectors. My guess is that this is one that you might be able to re-sell for a higher price in a couple of years. It is heading that way with for example, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8803-10"">the Elf</a>, at least here in Sweden, where a used one goes for double the acqusition value in 2012.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Final thoughts.</h4><div>You will really like having one of these for your collection. It's hard to properly express its coolness, you need to see it for yourself. I also believe it is really worth the money since it can be used in so many ways. Your imagination sets the limit. If you pass this now, you would wish you had at least one of three wishes...to get it later.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Just an allround, unique and great minifigure.</li><li>Many different pieces.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>....backprinting... anyone?</li></ul></div>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,3
"sideswinger","2021-04-24T03:01:38.887Z","GOOD, but not one of my FAV'S!","<p>The sixteenth and final figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Genie. This was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that purple turban with the gem attached to the front, and is a separate piece. I do like how it&#39;s separate, and I think it might have been new for the figure. I think it&#39;s dual-moulded, with that purple diamond and the pearl gold base. It&#39;s really great that LEGO made a new piece when it was pretty unnecessary. The purple turban itself looks pretty bad nowadays compared to the new turban, but it was an okay part back then. It just looks too smooth and strange to me. But in the end, it&#39;s a classic piece, and it was the only turban piece back then, so I guess I can&#39;t really complain much.</p>

<p>Next is his face, and I like a lot of things about it. First off, I love the smile, as well as that black beard and moustache. And another thing I just love about it is how it has that blue-green colour, which looks so fantastic. It really reminds me of the genie from Aladdin, which I almost wonder was purposeful on LEGO&#39;s part. Nonetheless, the face is great, even with it having no back facial printing.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and I just love the detail on it, so I&#39;m gonna break it all down. It carries on that blue-green colour scheme, and I love the muscles on his torso under the jacket. Speaking of which, I love the purple jacket, and how it looks to cover even the sides of the torso due to the clever casting colour. The gold line around it looks good too. The gold waistband is another nice touch to the torso. He has no back printing, but it has a purple colour which matches the jacket, so it&#39;s okay. But aside from the torso, I love the arms as well. The exposed blue-green arms work extremely well, and he even has some pearl gold hands representing gloves, which is just such a fine touch to me. Overall, it&#39;s a great torso.</p>

<p>Next is that bottom piece, which was very new to the figure. And wow, I just love the piece so&nbsp;much. The curvature to the sides, as well as the little tip at the bottom, and I love how perfectly it matches up with the lamp. One minor gripe I have is that It would&#39;ve been great if that gold waistband from the torso would carry on and be printed on the bottom, but I guess it is excusable since it was a brand-new piece already. Overall, it&#39;s still a great piece, and it is caste in blue-green like the head, which is great.</p>

<p>And lastly, his accessory is another new piece, being that genie lamp. It is caste in pearl gold, and oh my, do I love that piece. The stud on top allows the genie to be plugged directly on top, and the spout matches up to the bottom really well. It has a lot of great detail on it, with the round centre as well as the golden handle. I like how the very bottom of it has that lip to accommodate for a stud, and that looks pretty good. Overall, I love that accessory.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, this figure is pretty good. This isn&#39;t necessarily my favourite of the series, but it still looks great all around. I like the three new pieces, and I love what all is happening at the torso and arms. But for some reason, I don&#39;t like him as much as I feel like I should. I think it might be that turban, but I&#39;m really not that sure why. Still, I am gonna have to give him a 3 because he truly looks good, I&#39;m just not crazy about him. But that&#39;s it for this review! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
