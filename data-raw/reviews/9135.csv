One of the many fantastic figures which fails to stand out due to almost all of the others being absolutely unbelievably incredible is this, the Classic Alien. It is a great figure with no real flaws, but when compared with the Roman Soldier or the Genie for instance, this is just distinctly average. Anyway, before you choose to pass on this one, take a look at the review and see what you think.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The head is the only new mould on this figure, but it is amazing. The shape of the classic alien head is perfectly captured, right down to the wide staring eyes and&nbsp;unnervingly&nbsp;vacant expression. The piece is cast in light grey with black eyes (which have white pupils) and a tiny black mouth.</p><p>The torso is also light grey with lots of dark grey highlights to create a look of skin stretched tight over the Alien's skeleton. This is a very effective technique and I am glad they even got the hollow ribs in there which look a bit gruesome really!</p><p>The legs are unprinted, cast in light grey with dark grey hips.</p><p>One very useful thing is the accessory. A white laser gun which is exclusive and looks great, but even better is the short green lightsaber blade. This is very useful for making either Yoda's lightsaber look perfect or for Ahsoka's shorter green lightsaber when Lego eventually decide to make a season 3 Ahsoka for the Clone Wars.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I would say this is worth buying, despite the slightly average parts selection. However, there is a lot of&nbsp;playability&nbsp;here, especially with the recently&nbsp;released&nbsp;Alien Conquest sets, which bumps up my mark to...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

Basically because it is based of the classic alien. The best thing about this figure is the head mold. It is really nice, and really creepy.... The alien comes with a laser gun, with a trans-neon green blade for the laser. The aliens torso piece basically is the chest of an alien, but the&nbsp;design&nbsp;is really nice.&nbsp;That&nbsp;is about it! This figure would be in the top 5 out of<div>series 6.&nbsp;</div>",FALSE,5,5,3,5,5
"AETerry","2012-03-09T15:14:11.367Z","Classic Alien Review","I have a hard time personally liking this minifigure. It's clearly depicting one of the classic Gray aliens. And the mold job for his head with the large black eyes is done well. And the printing on his torso isn't too bad and I've seen it used for the pale grey, dead flesh of some custom zombie minifigures. For me, one of the best features with this minifigure is his accessory piece of the retro style laser gun and it's laser beam coming from it. If I were a fan of the Classic Gray Aliens, I would probably be more enthusiastic about this figure, but at $2.99 for it, he's a bit lack luster, especially when compared to more prominent favorites of the Leprechaun, Minotaur and Genie to name a few.<br>",TRUE,3,2,1,4,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure has a great looking new head piece that resembles the famous Roswell Grays, it has a body made up of mostly light and drak gray coloring. Sadly his torso print is only one-sided, however that doesn't detract from the look of the figure. His big expressive eyes have white dots in the upper corners, I do not know if these represent pupils or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's carrying a white space blaster piece and includes a green lightsaber blade for the laser blast. This Mini-Figure is a must have figure from Series 6 because with it we finally have a Classic style alien to fit in with the older Classic Space LEGO sets. That's right, although he'd fit in great with the more modern LEGO Space sets I think you'd get more out of displaying him with the older sets, something from the late seventies or early eighties featuring the Classic Space Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can get him, great, and if you want to stand him next to your Classic Space Mini-Figs then you can.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-09T15:59:03.783Z","the best ALIEN CMF!","<p>The first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Classic Alien. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that head piece, which was new to the figure. I really love that piece, and it has some detail to it as well, like the black eyes, and even that tiny mouth. I also love how perfectly round and smooth the whole thing is.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which does have some good printing. I really like the lines allover it, and I also really like how his hands are a dark grey, in contrast to the torso. He has no back torso printing, which would&#39;ve been nice, but oh well.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, but it&#39;s interesting how that top section is dark grey, when the bottom pieces are light grey.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, which is that ray gun with the pole coming out of it. I&#39;m gonna be honest: that accessory sucks, as we&#39;ve gotten that accessory in numerous CMF&#39;s. And unfortunately, we get an alarming amount of ray gun+pole combos in many more CMF&#39;s to come, so it&#39;s very overused to me.&nbsp;However, with that being said, the ray gun for this specific figure is fitting, and I really love the colour it&#39;s caste in, which is white. That colour for the gun isn&#39;t very common, so that&#39;s pretty cool. And the translucent green pole is a nice inclusion as well.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, this is my favourite LEGO CMF alien. We&#39;ve gotten a huge amount of CMF aliens, and this one is just the best representation of a typical alien that LEGO has ever made. I love that head piece, and that gun isn&#39;t that bad either. So&nbsp;while this isn&#39;t my favourite space-themed CMF, or my favourite in the series, this is still a pretty fantastic figure. And that&#39;s it for the review! Thanks for reading!</p>
