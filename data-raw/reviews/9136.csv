The inclusion of a pair of black pistols is also a highlight. I am not aware they have ever been released in black before making these exclusive! Beyond that however what is there to be had in this figure? Well read on and find out...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hat is another good reason for purchasing this figure. It is almost exclusive as the fedora has only appeared on the Gangster figure from Series 5 and in one Indiana Jones set before that. It looks great with the rest of the figure, and would look good on any villain basically!</p><p>The head is perfect for the character. He has bushy black eyebrows, a huge black moustache and some stubble around his chin. All in all he looks like a bit of a troublemaker!</p><p>He also has a nice dark red neckerchief which can cover his face up to his eyes, a good piece to include.</p><p>The torso is incredibly detailed with a grubby shirt and a black suit jacket. He has two&nbsp;bandoleers&nbsp;too which cross his chest and continue onto his back. In them are stored loads of bullets for his two pistols. He also sports a pair of brown gloves so he doesn't get his hands dirty.</p><p>His black legs are printed as well with a brown belt (which has a gold buckle as well as a few more bullets).</p><p>The pistols are just the same as your standard revolver, but black! Simple and effective, they&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;make him look more threatening.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While it is not the most exciting Minifigure in the series, the Bandit is not bad and I would advise you to purchase him if you can find him, particularly if you have the Cowboy.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"AETerry","2012-03-12T13:03:36.31Z","Bandit Review","I'll start off with the good points. To me, this is one of the better minifigures out of a stellar and very good Series 6 line up of minifigures. The print job is very good with the detailing from the torso, legs and even the face of the minifigure. Other highlights are the black revolvers. Before, these have only been seen in grey, so this is new. The dark red bandana and the black cowboy or fedora hat all make excellent highlights and fill out the concept and idea of this minifigure.<br><br>If I do have any negatives, they are slight ones. I could knock this and say this is a revisit or redux of the Cowboy minifigures from Series 1. The bandit is still great, comparing him to the Cowboy, I feel he is of better quality and design and it's perfect in a way making up for those who missed out on the short production run of Series 1. And the two still stand out on their own respectively, to the point of even being able to compliment each other in a collection.<br><br>In short, I do love this figure and for those who've been lucky to find and pick him up in the bags, he's well worth it at $2.99, even for just the new color palette of accessories or design.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-02-03T20:34:56.88Z","Hang'Em High","<p>Set #8827 Bandit: A great new Mini-Fig from the LEGO Collectible Mini-Figures. The Bandit is one of the better offerings from Series 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bandit has a mean looking (covered in scars) facial print with a rough unshaven beard and a well maintained mustache. He's wearing a dark red bandana, and a black hat matching the one first introduced with the Indiana Jones Theme. His torso is a double-sided print, full of bullets on a pair of bandoliers. While difficult to make out underneath these two belts is a great looking shirt and jacket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His legs also have priting with a low slung bullet belt, he has brown gloves and two black pistols, a somewhat common piece with a new rare color. Overall I'd say that so far I've been impressed with the Mini-Figs in Series 6, a lot more so than some of the past series and I hope that this trend will continue with LEGO's little Mini-Figure army builders.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"skywalkerfan52","2020-09-13T19:13:56.35Z","Random minifigure history review: Bandit","<p>Today&#39;s minifigure review is Bandit from series 6 which released in 2012 and retails for $2.99 with one minifigure per bag. This was available at retail stores from 2012 until 2013. He has an angry expression with a light beard with his moustache on his face hiding behind his red mask. His torso is just unbelievable because he has a brown belt on his waist and 2 straps on his torso to reload his 2 pistols. He also has a brown hat, and he has another belt on his legs. I hope you enjoy this little history about the Bandit.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-09T20:45:46.097Z","surprisingly GOOD!","<p>The fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Bandit. This was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is his cowboy hat, which is caste in black. That piece isn&#39;t extremely rare or anything like that, but it does really fit the figure. Plus, it isn&#39;t the most common in that colour, if I&#39;m not mistaking.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which does have a really awesome expression. I love the evil look, and the beard and moustache is brilliant. It&#39;s just an awesome expression overall, and it could be used outside the setting pretty easily. He has no alternate face, which is good since it&#39;d be severely exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is his neckerchief, which was new to the figure, I believe. That&#39;s a really awesome piece, and I love the moulding on the front and back alike. I also love how it covers part of his face, and it works with the&nbsp; head and torso really well. Of course nowadays it isn&#39;t that special, but back then, it was pretty great.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and the printing on it is great. I really love the bullet straps around him, and I&#39;m in love with that whole western design. The big belt is cool, and he has some really nice back torso printing, which is continuing those bullet straps from the front of the torso.</p>

<p>Next, we have his legs, which have great printing as well. I really love how it has that&nbsp;great belt strap printing on it. I do think it needs side leg printing, but I guess it can be overlooked.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his two pistols, which have a good colour to them, being that black colour. That colour for those pieces is awesome, and it&#39;s pretty rare, if I&#39;m not mistaking.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I wasn&#39;t super crazy about this figure before this review, but upon further investigation, he isn&#39;t bad at all. I really like that neckerchief, which was new for the figure, and the pistols&#39; caste in black is brilliant. Overall, this still isn&#39;t my favourite in the series, and he does look similar to lots of LEGO figures. However, I actually like this figure, and I am gonna give him a four out of 5. But that&#39;s it for this figure! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
