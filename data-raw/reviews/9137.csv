It is not in scale with other figures at all, and just a bit odd really. Despite this, the Minifigure itself is absolutely brilliant! The design is perfect and looks a lot like the Minotaur from Greek myth (apart from its size) ready to take on any heroes who hope to conquer him.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The head is made up of three pieces. Two white horns and a large exclusive head piece which also covers the top half of the torso. It is predominantly brown with two yellow eyes which are very&nbsp;imposing! There is a lot of fur texture too which is a great touch.</p><p>The torso is brown with little hairy bits and some huge muscles. Most of this is obscured though by the head piece. There is unfortunately no back printing.</p><p>The legs have a blue belt and a sort of skirt design printed on them. He even has hooves printed on his feet which is brilliant in my opinion, it shows how much care was taken with this Minifigure by the designer.</p><p>He also comes with an axe on a short black pole which is a nice part&nbsp;to have and could be very useful for future MOCS.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I would advise this to be one of the first figures you should buy from this wave of Collectable Minifigures. It is very unique and looks good as a&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;costume for one of your citizens in Lego city. But due to the scaling issues (not because it should be any bigger, but just because it has a low playability) I must knock a point off and give this figure...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

"AETerry","2012-03-14T14:46:46.287Z","Minotaur Review","The Minotaur is easily my top favorite from Series 6. He is very well done with the new specialized head to show that bull head and the new style horns that curve out. I love the print job on his torso. It's easy to take the brown torso and use it for one of the Werewolf minifigures of Series 4. Even the legs are printed well to show a sort of kilt. The axe design has been seen with other figures such as the evil Dwarf, yet it compliments the Minotaur well.<br><br>At $2.99, the value of this minifigure well worth it in concept and design as it's one of three Fantastical and Mythological minis of Series 6 that have been done. The other two being the Leprechaun and the Genie. This shows just a tip of the iceberg of just how much potential for future concepts and ideas that LEGO could branch out to that haven't been done yet.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-02-09T13:25:27.383Z","Beware the Myth","<p>Set #8827 Minotaur: Another great Mini-Fig from Series 6, and another mythological based Mini-Fig brought to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing amongst your Roman Soldiers, Spartan Warriors, Highland Battlers, Gladiators, Evil Dwarves and Elves this Minotaur is a pretty impressive looking Mini-Fig. He includes a brand new head piece that, could lead to some Hercules and Greek Myth Themed Sets in the future. His torso printing is one-sided, a muscular looking furry body with a dark blue skirt or kilt or something. He's also got two little hooves printed onto the front of his feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He carries a short axe, overall I'd say this is one of the great offerings from Series 6, and he'd make a great display piece for a Mythological diorama, here's hoping that Medusa and Hercules are some of the Mini-Figs being dreamed up for later Series. You can't go wrong with this guy, get two if you can find him. You may however want to MOC up some different weapons if you're planning to army build this Mini-Fig.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"tkettle9719","2012-01-20T21:56:56.88Z","The Beast in the Labyrinth","I got this set for myself from Lego Shop @ Home, and find that this fine minifigure is excellent enough to make up for any shortcomings that the Flamenco Dancer has.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The printed parts here are used excellently.<br></li><li>-I also like that the axe is included, giving a nice detail to a near-perfect minifigure.<br></li><li>-The minotaur headpiece is extravagantly done.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Back printing would have been quite nice.<br></li><li>-The minotaur eyes seem a bit oddly located.<br></li><li>-I would have liked a shield, since he's already got an axe.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is among my favorite figs of Series 6, because of great frontal detail and great piece selection. I highly recommend this to fantasy-lovers like me; it looks great. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-13T02:02:38.14Z","an OKAY figure!","<p>The eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Minotaur. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that Minotaur head piece. My sister thought it looked like a brown blob, but I think it looks quite nice. The moulding on it is really great, and I love all the fur on the lower part of it. The moulding on the nostrils is great as well, and the yellow eyes is a nice&nbsp;touch. Those two white horns are separate pieces, and I think they were new for the figure, though I could be wrong about that.&nbsp;The figure would be severely incomplete without them, so it&#39;s great to see them here.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which features some great printed detail. I really love the printing on his muscular stomach. It is a bit sad that he has no back torso printing. Some brown fur back there would&#39;ve been a nice touch, but I guess it is what it is.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some great printed detail. The blue on the front looks great, and I really like the band of white and gold in the middle. I also really the printing on that top piece of the legs. But gosh, this figure severely needs side leg printing. He has none, though, and that looks awful from the sides, since that blue cloth design just ends abruptly. He needs side printing, no excuse there.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, which is just that axe. It isn&#39;t the most complex accessory, but the fact that one is included at all is pretty cool to me. I do like how the blade piece itself has that sparkly dark grey design, which isn&#39;t too common.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is good. I used to be crazy about him, and I was so in love with him. However, once I take a closer look, he isn&#39;t exactly outrageously fantastic. The two thing that bother me most about this figure&nbsp;is that he has no back torso printing, and that he has side leg printing, the latter of which is inexcusable. But I do appreciate that big head piece, as well as the included accessory, which was pretty unnecessary. Still, the lack of side leg printing makes me give the figure a pretty high three. But that&#39;s it for the figure! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
