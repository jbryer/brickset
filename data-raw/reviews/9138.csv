"CapnRex101","2011-12-18T16:37:03.157Z","8827 (15) - Highland Battler","<p>The Highland Battler is an interesting Minifigure in many ways, not only does he include one brand new part, but his character is clearly based on Braveheart, a brilliant candidate to become a Lego figure, does he live up to expectations? Well read on and see...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hairpiece is the same as that usually included with Dumbledore Minifigures, but in brown on this occasion. I think this is a new colour for this part which is always nice. It perfectly&nbsp;represents&nbsp;the hair of Braveheart from the film.</p><p>The face is vicious and angry, but awesome. He has light brown eyebrows and some stubble around his face.</p><p>The torso is very highly detailed, with printing of various straps, the top of the tartan sash and some armour plating underneath. His arms are yellow as they are bare.</p><p>The legs are also printed with the rest of the tartan sash and some brown boots.</p><p>His accessories are the best bit of the figure. He holds a shield in one hand which has some silver studs in it but is predominantly brown, and in the other a brand new piece. A pearl silver longsword with some detailing around the handle. It would look great with knights and almost any other warrior come to think of it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So, would I say it lives up to expectations? Well yes and no, the sword and detailing is great, but I can't help but feel that the shield could have had a little bit more going on, at the moment it looks a little bit blank. Nonetheless this is a figure which you probably ought to buy, to fight against the Roman if nothing else (I know they are from different periods in history, but this figure makes an excellent member of a Gallic hoard). The sweet spot for this Minifigure would be the&nbsp;playability and the detail&nbsp;I think which is why I am going to give it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"AETerry","2012-03-15T15:29:40.723Z","Highland Battler Review","With so many great minifigures out of Series 6, the Highland Battler doesn't quiet make it to the top of the list as my all time favorite, but is still a must have and excellent figure. For me, what would have made this figure even better is some blue woad printing on his face. The detailing print of the torso and legs to convey a highland warrior are great. I just love the plaid coloring. The sword looks to be a new design style and I love it too along with the shield that compliments this set and long brown hair piece. I'd say the concept idea for this figure has been executed well and his price tag of $2.99 is well worth it to those who manage to find him in the store.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-11T21:43:38.21Z","My Fellow Clansmen","<p>Set #8827 Highland Battler: Children hide many things when wandering the store, case in point I somehow managed to find this at TRU quite by accident. So I bought him, at the time I thought I'd gotten only a Clockwork Robot, imagine my surprise when I found this little dude inside.</p>
<p>The Highland Battler is from Series 6, the white packets. He was and still is quite in-demand if I'm very much not mistaken, due to the nature of his print, his parts and all around the fact that most Mini-Figures of his Theme type from CMF are always desireable.</p>
<p>What a brilliant print this Mini-Figure has, all single-sided unfortunately, a double-sided torso might have been nice, still one can't complain too loudly. Wearing the Scottish battle dress, this Mini-Fig is ready to go to war against Julius Ceasar, or perhaps the invading Danes...Uh, I mean Vikings. He has a dark blue torso, not seen very often amongst Mini-Figures, the printing on his front is just... Well look at that picture LEGO provided, it's oozing awesome details and great design work. I'm certain you'd find someone like him standing against the Morrigan, he's wearing armor underneath the standard Highlands battle dress, not exactly a kilt and I'm getting a tad repetitive. Moving on, the legs on this Mini-Figure are also quite nice, the torso print carries down onto his belt and upper legs, while the lower legs remain the base brown plastic with a hint of yellow added to show his skin.</p>
<p>The accessories are all brand new pieces, the first time we got to see the round shield piece and the sword that would become a standard in Lord of the Rings. The shield is a nice dark brown coloring, and also includes printed detailing. The only flaw this Mini-Figure has that I can see is the hair, as we can see his facial expression is a bared teeth look, surrounded by red stubble, where his moustache, beard, side burns and such will grow in. The hairpiece however doesn't match, LEGO goofed and gave us a much darker brown hair piece, if you're going to print red facial hair than the hairpiece should be colored to match. (I'm not too fond of this hairpiece for a different reason beside that though, for some reason this hairpiece always seems to look off, like the Mini-Figure using it has got a protruding forhead... Or receding hairline. It just looks odd, I am not fond of that aesthetic.)</p>
<p>Overall this is a pretty good find, a great looking Mini-Figure to add to your historical warriors collection and well worth tracking down. With a few minor modifications (like replacing the brown hairpiece with a red one) you'll have a really great looking Mini-Figure.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"Ernst","2012-05-31T14:27:53.523Z","There can be only one !!","<p>Overall 5 bricks : Another great serie 6 minifigure. A very original thought and a great figure for Castle fans and MOC builders. This small but fierce looking fighter will be found as extra Knight in a lot of Castle and LOTR sets. Looking great and very usefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is none, 1 brick for assembling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : An all new hairpiece, usefull for both male and female figures. Awesome face, he really will scare his enemy. The torso and legs are very detailed and look very genuine for the time he lived in. Great new sword and a good shield, all very good parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : the single figure has not much playing value but this figure will, like said before, be found to join in many existing sets and even more in MOC's. A lot of people will try to find more of this figure than just one I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : Like for all CMF's €2,95 is a good price, no comments here. I think this is a figure that will rise in price in the used markets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,5
"BeardedCastleGuy","2012-02-23T18:14:27.017Z","Great Design.","The Highland Battler minifigure is one of the top three designs from Collectable Minifigure Series 6.&nbsp; <br>This minifigure has nice detailed printing on the front and even side printing on the legs as well.&nbsp; There is also a new sword for him to wield as well as a round buckler with a new print as well.&nbsp; For me the weakest part is the minifigures hair, something about the line used on the front edge seems a little over done in regards to the number slopes and directional changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its not a horrible piece by any means, it just seems a little off to me.<br><br>Overall the final visual product is just fantastic and definitely one that many people will want more than one of.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-04-09T16:15:31.643Z","not BAD!","<p>The second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Highland Battler. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that old, long hair piece. It was a common piece back then, but a little hard to get in that colour. I don&#39;t really like that piece nowadays, as I think it&#39;s retired due to the Dumbledore hair from that Harry Potter Great Hall set, but in 2012, it was an okay piece. I just don&#39;t like how smooth it looks; it looks unnatural. But again, it was kind of a rare colour for 2012, and is a nice colour for that piece even today. It fits the figure pretty well, too.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a great expression that could be used outside the setting. I like how angry he looks, with that angry snarl, and the red eyebrows make him a bit more unique to certain characters, which is cool. I also love his red stubble around his mouth. He has no back facial printing.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has a decent print. I do like the dark blue and brown colour scheme, and I like how his yellow arms are exposed. But of course, his back torso has no printing, which really stinks.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have pretty good printing. I really like the dark blue, and the green lines look good as well. He even has some yellow flesh poking through, on the front and sides. He does kind of need that blue cloth printed on the sides, but the detail on the front will suffice.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his two accessories, which both look superb. His shield has some exclusive printing, which is cool. I also really love the dark brown colour it&#39;s caste in. His sword is really cool as well, and both of those accessories really fit the character.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! When I first looked at the figure I wasn&#39;t a big fan. But upon taking a closer look, he isn&#39;t terrible. The printing on his torso and legs is really great, and I guess that hair isn&#39;t terrible in hindsight. But still, this isn&#39;t a crazy awesome figure. The printing makes him almost worth 3 dollars; I think 2 dollars would be better, but 3 is okay. Inn the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 3 out of 5. And that&#39;s it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
