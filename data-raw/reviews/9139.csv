It is without a shadow of a doubt the best Minifigure released so far from any of the series of&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures. It is incredible! The detail, the number of new parts, the playability, everything about this figure is perfect. Anyway, before I hyperventilate, I am going to move onto the actual review. See what you think.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>We will start, as always, at the top. The helmet is brand new and is a great representation of a real Roman helmet in a misted silver. There is a huge amount of moulded detail, and a hole for adding a plume if you want your Roman to become an officer.</p><p>The head is very serious, with lines for his bony cheeks and some bushy eyebrows.</p><p>The torso is light grey but printed on the front with some silvery armour plating as well as many little ties and metal studs. It is one of the most detailed pieces I have ever seen on any Lego Minifigure I own! His arms are bare just like a real Roman soldier.</p><p>The legs are printed all over, with belt printing and thigh printing. There are screws, varying layers of red cloth to form his skirt and even some little chains. On his feet are printed some red stripes to&nbsp;portray&nbsp;sandals like on the Spartan and the Gladiator.</p><p>The figure comes with two accessories, a brown spear with a silver head and an absolutely wonderful shield which is a brand new piece and features some lovely gold printing of eagle wings. There is a stud in the middle where something could be attached if you wish. It is thankfully curved to just the right amount and can be held very well by the soldier too.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Now before I sum up, I know what you are probably thinking: can the Romans form a Testudo formation when put together? The answer: yes, they can, sort of. Sadly the helmet must be removed for the shield to be held aloft, but nobody can see that once you have the shields covering the figures! Anyway, overall this is the one figure from this Series which is an absolute must have, although there are many other excellent Minifigures to be had as well. Given that there is no fault to be found I have to award this amazing figure with...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"Brickman193","2012-01-20T03:59:45.373Z","LEGO Legio","Every so often, LEGO produces a minifig that grabs your attention, be it on a poster or a wall-mounted collection box. We've seen it before with the Spartan, the Elf and the Diver (just kidding on that last one), and I believe LEGO has done it again. The Roman Soldier - a Centurion - is another remarkable 'fig and one of the main money spinners for series 6.<div><br></div><div><b>PROS</b></div><div><ul><li>The Roman Soldier, as befitting his station, has a stern looking face. It's new, but nothing we haven't really seen before. The silver helmet is new, and has a hole on top for customising with feathers or the like if you feel it needs spicing up. The body is a breastplate print - new, and Roman enough to stand out from a legion of other breastplate torsos we've seen over 20+ years. The legs continue the red and silver and cap it off with sandal printing like the Spartan.</li><li>Much like the Spartan, whom I feel is a spiritual predecessor, the Roman Soldier carries a spear and a shield. The spear is a relatively new design -2-3 years old, only in a handful of sets, and it adds to the look of the minifig. The shield is new - bold red, square, with actual printing that strongly resembles the real life sources. If one had enough time and money, a hundred Roman Soldiers in formation would look amazing in a diorama.</li></ul><div><b>CONS</b></div></div><div><ul><li>The Roman Soldier is not perfect. His legs are yellow in design, and the skirt he wears is red. The back is not printed, giving one the unfortunate impression that the centurion is wearing bright red briefs.</li><li>It's nit-picking, I know, but the Roman Soldier needs a red cloak like the Spartan's, to complete his look. This would go some way to solving the first problem I mentioned, but this can only be done if you had a few spare Spartans willing to donate their capes. Still, even without the cloak, the centurion is an intimidating figure.</li><li>This problem can't be solved by anyone, but the demand - there's no denying the Roman Soldier is a cool looking minifig, and such coolness will inevitably push up the price in the aftermarket. Also, collectors armed with barcodes and scanners will buy this minifig up fast, so make him a priority if you want the LEGO legionnaire in your collection.</li></ul><div><b>SUMMARY</b></div></div><div>The Roman Soldier stands up well against the Spartan and the Elf, and I think it's one of the few Series 6 minifigs worth the price ($5 AUS). Buy him now, in singular or plural if you can!</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The completed figure is absolutly outstanding and has full attention to detail. He includes an excellent roman helmet part,&nbsp;nice spear, amazing shield&nbsp;and excellent printing on the chest and torso. The playability of this figure alone is not long but certainly one of the best figures for play in the series. This figure goes well with all the figures, especially the spartan and gladiator figures from the past [whom I unfortunately own neither of those]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value like most of the figures is good but not outstanding especially as you may not find the figure you want. Overall, this has to be one of the best figures in series 6 and provides both similarity and difference to all other roman figures made so far. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend this model to everyone. Whether you love or loave the minifigure series as the details are fantastic. If you can, buy or try to find this model as soon as you can, you wont regret it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,4

It's more a second tier minifigure to me when I compare it to the Minotaur, Genie and Leprechaun who were more hotly anticipated and sought after by me when looking through packs.<br><br>That doesn't mean it's not a great figure. There's just so many of them. The Roman Soldier as a historical minifigure is comparable to the Spartan and Gladiator minifigures that have come out in other Series.<br><br>The detailing for him is very well done with the printed armor and leggings. Even the feet have a suggestion of wearing sandals or shoes. The spear is very similiar to the one that the Spartan and Indian Chief minifigures carry. The helmet is well molded, adding character to this concept. My particular favorite of this figure is the rectangular shield it comes with.<br><br>As I've read with other reviews and forums, this minifigure is rare and hard to find in the boxes when there's only two of them per. So it'd be hard for those trying to amass an army for a larger MOC to get many unless they're willing to put down a lot of money. Which to me, says that LEGO really should consider, in light of the Spartan, Minotaur and Gladiator minifigures, do a Greek-Roman Theme as it's one of many untapped potential ideas have barely been touched on with the minifigure line.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,5

"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-15T20:56:30.51Z","Roman around the ancient world. ","Thousands of years on, the Roman Empire still exerts a powerful grip on our imaginations, along with the other major players of the Mediterranean in the morning of the world (namely, Egypt and Greece). Look around you, and it's not hard to find examples of Roman influence still present in our modern world: from architecture to political philosophy to decades of ""sword and sandal"" Hollywood movies, Rome is still everywhere. Augustus Caesar would be proud indeed.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Living in Roman times, though, was not altogether pleasant: the ancient world was a brutal one, and life was short and often violent for any number of reasons. In the lead up to their zenith as a Mediterranean and world power, Rome was always a militaristic culture, and it's therefore unsurprising that one of the most enduring images of the Roman Empire is the legionnaire himself, a member of a powerful fighting force that came to dominate varying regions of the world, from Britain to northern Africa (they also got themselves into sticky defeats a number of times, too, but no one talks about those). Even in political life, many so-called senators and governors began their careers in the army, rising to high office only after surviving so many battles.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is all to say that our little LEGO Roman Soldier has a weighty history behind him, which may or may not matter depending on your affinity for history. ""Historically accurate"" might be the wrong phrase, but this Roman Soldier definitely conveys the popular image of a Roman legionnaire in red and silver. The detail on his torso and shield are absolutely phenomenal, right down to the leather straps across his armour and brown printing that ostensibly represents sandals. His shield is likewise magnificent, bearing traditional Roman iconography of the thunderbolt with wings, though I'll be darned if I know what that means. I believe that both his helmet and shield are new moulds, too, which will hopefully add some variety to what standard foot soldiers can carry in the future.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you fancy beefing up your legionnaire even further, you could take one of those spare red plumes from your Kingdoms sets and stick it into his helmet, and if that doesn't please you, pick up a red cape and drape it upon him while shouting ""veni, vidi, vici"" and paying homage to Jupiter. <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sh018"">Thor's</a>/<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sh003"">Superman's</a> cape will work here, although the dark red cape that King <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=lor021"">Theoden</a> is sporting looks even better, in my opinion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>From what I can tell, this guy is already fetching a premium price on the secondary market, so snap him up while you can. Also, if you like this little Roman guy as much as I do, you might consider wandering over to Cuusoo and lend a bit of support to <a href=""http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/9068"">The Glory of Rome</a> project, which I think is a really cool idea. I mean, come on: if Collectible Minifigs gave us <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Monster%20Fighters"">Monster Fighters</a> in the end, is it unreasonable to think that at least one new historical theme might be on the way?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,1

<p><strong>Building :</strong>&nbsp;not required so 1 brick</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks: </strong>because they are great ! The helmet, torso and the legs with sandals look very authentic.

"sideswinger","2021-04-18T21:31:55.57Z","a good, HISTORIC figure!","<p>The tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 6 is the Roman Soldier. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that helmet piece, which is a great piece. I really have no idea if that helmet was new to te figure, but I do know that it looks really great. The surrounding rim, as well as how it hangs down on the sides of his head is all really cool. Overall, I really like that part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, and the printing on it is okay. It isn&#39;t really that amazing, as it is sort of generic. The angry look is okay, and it&#39;s useful if you plan on using a beard piece or something, but it&#39;s slightly uninteresting by itself. He has no alternate face.</p>

<p>Next is his torso. The detail on it is pretty good, and all the strap and buckles is good. I think it would be cool if he had armour on his arms, but I guess it&#39;s excusable. He has no back torso printing, which is disappointing, if you ask me. For three dollars, back printing would be nice.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, and I love the detail on them. The red shorts on front are amazing, as is the shoe designs, and oh my, the side leg printing looks so fantastic, with more nice red. The detail for the belt on the top section looks great with the brown strap, and the detail between the legs on the upper leg piece has some more nice brown detail. Overall, I&#39;m generally impressed by the detail all over the legs.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his two accessories, and they both look incredible. That big red shield is a fantastic piece, with the big stud in the centre, and the gold roman printing surrounding the stud is pretty awesome as well. And that spear is cool too. It is not dual-moulded, but printed instead. It still looks incredible, and the shiny silver tip on the top is rubber, while the brown handle is reddish-brown. Overall, I really like those two accessories, and they really complete the figure.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this&nbsp;figure! Overall, I don&#39;t really like historical figures, and if you read my review on the Highland Warrior of this series, who was also a historic figure, you know I didn&#39;t like that figure. But I am shocked as heck when I say wow; I am in love with this figure. The printing all over his torso and especially the legs is impressive and incredible, as is both of his epic accessories. In all LEGO Minifigure Series&#39;, the historical figures are my least favourites. And while this isn&#39;t exactly my favourite of the series, it is one of them, and the design of him might just be my favourite historic figure ever. One of the reasons I like this so much is because it&#39;s clearly a Roman soldier, making the theme of him clear and plain, which is a problem with many historical CMF&#39;s. Overall, 5 out of 5 from me.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for this figure! Thanks for reading!</p>
