"legoDad42","2012-01-25T12:45:33.097Z","New/Improved!","<p>Like the tagline says...<em>'Everyone, needs One!'</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's exactly right. Improving on the previous Brick Separator tool ( <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=630-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=630-1</a>&nbsp;), the new <em>lighter/slimmer</em> Orange Separator is a <strong>must have</strong> for the casual builder, building with your kids when they need help separating&nbsp;pieces(saves on&nbsp;fingernails and&nbsp;no scratches and teeth marks on your bricks...;)&nbsp;as well as the seasoned MOC'er.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I acquired one with the Mini Modular VIP Set ( <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10230-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10230-1</a>&nbsp;) and it immediately came in handy with&nbsp;the build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the previous separator you can still separate plates, bricks top and bottom and use the front bottom edge to get out tiles and jumper plates. But at times it was tricky to get those flat tiles out. With this separator, at the end of the handle you have a nice tapered lip that works great getting out flat tiles no matter the size. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also handy is a rod/cross axle&nbsp;on the top to push out tough fitting Technic pins and axels. Works dandy.</p>
<p>Plus...the new bright orange color makes it stand out in your build area.</p>
<p>I suggest getting two (or if you have the older one keep it and get this new one)...as 2 separators are extremely handy when you need to separate small plates stacked one on top of another. You attach one separator to the bottom plate/element and then use another to pull off the other top plate/element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</strong>...get one now!</p>

"brickmatt","2012-10-19T22:09:05.967Z","It's new and improved...","<p>...but don't throw your old one away. The new separator has some great features, but the old style still has some advantages.</p><p>The first good thing about the new separator is that it can remove a jumper plate, even when set in the middle of a large plate. The underside of the brick separator, where it connects to other bricks, has been so made that it can accept a stud in the middle.</p><p>The next improvement is the inclusion of an axle on the top of the separator for pushing out axles or pins that you just can't get a grip on. It is possible to build a stand-alone tool for the same purpose, but it's handy to have right on the separator.</p><p>The last improvement is the shape, which, along with size, turns out to be the drawback of the separator as well. The entire separator is the same width, two studs wide, while the old separator was wider at the end and tapered down to two studs. While the uniform width makes it possible for the new separator to get into corners, which the old one couldn't do, the handle of the new separator is rather small, so it could be hard to hold for some people. Additionally, unlike the old separator, the 'pliers effect' is difficult to obtain. This is the procedure of separating two small plates, such as 1x2's, by placing one brick separator on top and another on the bottom piece and separating the two pieces by pushing the separators together. The angle of the new separator's handle doesn't give enough leverage for this to happen when the two separators are directly aligned. They must be placed in opposite directions and the process doesn't work as effectively this way.</p><p>In summary,<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Effective jumper plate removal</li><li>Axle on top</li><li>Fits into corners<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Can be hard to hold</li><li>Loss of 'pliers effect'<br></li></ul>
<p>The shape and size are only minor quibbles, and the new improvements are excellent. The Lego Company has started including them again in larger sets, so you're bound to run across one sooner or later. I have four already, having purchased two when they first came out and received two more in sets. However you may acquire one, it will certainly be a welcome and useful addition.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5

"fikko3107","2012-12-11T00:48:16.62Z","The handiest LEGO tool I ever had","This, I dare say, is one of my best LEGO buys so far. Since I live in Indonesia, I can't get this set via Shop-at-home. I had always wanted this set, since I knew the old one from the Creator web videos. My chance suddenly came when I saw it hung on the back of a LEGO exclusive store (with putty,of course. don't worry,they didn't drill a hole into it to hang it and the putty leaves little-to-no residue on the brick ) while on a vacation to Singapore. I instantly Purchased one along with a Stormer XL, a Cad bane's speeder and an Ostrich race using my Birthday allowance.<br><br>I like this tool. it really helps to remove plates on bricks or plates on plates. one complaint that I have (which Jamie Berard swore wasn't a marketing gimmick) was that it's still difficult to remove plates from the same plate (e.g. 2x2 plate on a 2x2 plate) without the use of another brick separator. What's more, I heard it's more difficult to pry open stuck-together 2x2 plates using the new separator, since getting the leverage to do it is more difficult.<br><br>Improvements from the old one is that now, this separator removes jumper plates, which is good to know. The other end which is thin can be used to remove tiles, since tiles were purposely given a gap so separating it is easier (But be warned: do this carefully or else the tile may fly off!) though not everyone find this as an improvement, the separator is sleeker now with the whole thing being consistently 2 studs wide from one end to the other. Some people said it feels awkward to use the new separator since it's smaller, But me, as a TFOL, find it just fine to use.<br><br>Another innovation is a built-in, loose technic axle, to remove axles and pegs. personally, i don't really use this; I prefer using an old 8 studs long technic axle. but i suppose it's just preferences...<br><br>The separator is complete with the LEGO logo and some bumps so that you could have a good grip on it. the one in this set is orange, although a green one exists. Since there are studs, stud holes, its made of ABS plastic and it has a design and parts number, technically it is a real LEGO element in its own right. Like the old one, I've never seen it being used in MOCs yet though. My little sister also pointed out that it attaches to 2xX bricks(2x2,2x3,2x4,etc.) because of its new shape.<br><br>All in all, it's a good buy. it have also help me to stop the compelling want to use my teeth (Old habits die hard). the price is rather steep, especially since Asian countries (Except Hong Kong and maybe Japan) Sells LEGO sets at least 30% higher than normal price, But I'd say It's still a very good, worth it buy.<br>",TRUE,3,4,1,1,3
"Sethro3","2016-04-05T21:37:07.33Z","Never get stuck again","<p>I never had the old version growing up. I never used my teeth either mind you, but cut up my little fingers instead. When they started inserting these into some of the larger sets as an adult collector, I realized how useful it actually was and regretted never having one earlier.</p>

<p>It has come in handy many times over, especially with removing tiles or many small plates. Sometimes your fingers just don&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t own any of the actual polybag version, only the many, many I have from sets. I think I have upwards of 30. They sit in a Pick a Brick cup so I can always find one. I throw one in with any WIP, just in case. It is nice having so many extras for this very reason. If I lose one, I&#39;m okay. If I can&#39;t get to one near where I am building, I usually have another one close by. They are scattered throughout my work areas.</p>

<p>Some people find it to be a nuisance having so many, but I&#39;m thankful for it.</p>

<p>If you plan on doing ANY building, I highly recommend having at least 2 of these. Sometimes you can straddle the piece in question from above/below and pry it apart that way.</p>

<p>Definitely recommend. Is it worth $2.50? I think so. But only if I didn&#39;t have tons of &quot;free&quot; ones already.</p>

"Gameaucracy","2015-03-23T03:31:03.91Z","Brick Separator - Literal Title Please","<p>Well, my very first review! This is an exciting thing to start, I can&#39;t wait to go over all the cool sets I own. To keep it all organized I should start from the top of my &quot;own&quot; list and move down; so what is up first? 630-3, the Brick Separator...</p>

<p>I suppose this is going to be a bit trickier than I thought. I did say I would start at the top of my list though, so here we go! The Brick Separator is a LEGO tool that separates bricks. There, can I go home&nbsp;now? No, well here is the long version then.</p>

<p>Although not the first brick separator that LEGO has produced, the idea of having a tool that can be used for those fickle bricks that don&#39;t want to leave each other&#39;s warm embrace has been a very important design question for LEGO that can compare to the sets themselves. What types of removals will the tool allow? Is it just a glorified pry&nbsp;bar for getting those skinny 1x2s or 2x2s you&#39;ve been putting together (you monster), or will you be able to pull apart technic pieces, snap&nbsp;plates off each other, and get a larger tax rebate this year? As such several separators exist, with this one being the newest addition to the family. It&#39;s sleek, sexy, and orange; what more could you want from the thing that will replace using a butter knife or your teeth?</p>

<p>It is a great tool to have kicking around, although if you start buying the large sets you will start to accumulate these as several of the sets have one of these included. I only have 2 (one bought by itself and one from a set) because I am a dirty peasant that can&#39;t afford the expensive sets. For that reason you are going to start to get a few of these, although having them included in sets is a nice though especially for the larger sets. As far as recommendations go, if you asked me I would say, &quot;what are you doing in my house?&quot;, but then I would go &quot;yeah it&#39;s a great tool for LEGO enthusiasts, the cops are on their way as we speak&quot;. Pick one up or grab one from one of the larger sets.</p>
