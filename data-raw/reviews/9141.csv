<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This box is just like the architect series and the booklet is the same quality. &nbsp;It tells the story of how LEGO began as a furniture company who began making toys during the great depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;People stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;buying furniture but everyone wanted to buy a toy for their kid. &nbsp;And this Wooden&nbsp;Duck was produced and sold&nbsp;out&nbsp;almost immediately. &nbsp;Read up on it if you have never heard the tale. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty basic, but they capture the look of the original wooden duck very well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick but still has some clever techniques. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a great, odd display model that immediately starts up the conversation about where it came from. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have a great fondness for this set and will always remember it as the best corporate Christmas&nbsp;gift of all time. &nbsp;</p>
