"wunztwice","2012-01-05T11:51:55.1Z","Pretty good parts pack","I picked this set up for it's dark green ""cheese-grater"" slopes, planning on selling the figures to make back some of the purchase price.&nbsp; I do not like the weird snake figures, but I build, I don't collect so no worries in that department.<br><br>As to the build itself it was enough to keep me occupied while being a passenger for part of a long drive.&nbsp; It is fairly straight forward, but unique enough to keep me building instead of just parting it out.<br><br>Where the real treat came in was how many useful parts there were for me.&nbsp; Plenty of 1x2/2x4 brackets in both light bley and in lime, not to mention all the curved slopes (1x4 lime &amp; 1x4 double, dark bley).&nbsp; This set also contains the most 1x1 round tiles in light bley of any set so far (at time of posting).&nbsp; Any dark purple is welcomed by me, and the 5 1x2 'double' cheese slopes and nice.<br><br>Overall the set is a tad overpriced at $25 for the selection you get IMO, but it is still within the under $0.10/piece we associate with LEGO sets.<br><br>The main disappointment was that the large two-tone spike with the rubbery tip (in the middle of the snake head) is lime and REGULAR green, not dark green as it appears on the box art.&nbsp; Poor form there, LEGO.<br><br>So, if you are looking to bulk up your store of some of those specific parts (I can finally finish that dark green diesel locomotive!) or want some crazy snake mech to play with, this is a good set.&nbsp; If you are looking for a fantastic build, or a super-good parts pack, I would pass and BrickLink the parts...<br><br>All totaled up: 4/5 bricks.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"NinjaGO_","2012-01-28T16:28:35.133Z","Amazing!","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>When I first got this set, I was distracted from my other Fangpyre&nbsp;vehicles because it had so much&nbsp;playability&nbsp;in it. The arms can move&nbsp;practically&nbsp;anywhere since they're on ball joints, and my only complaint is that the feet pop off every other second(i'm just exaggerating).
This comes with one&nbsp;missile&nbsp;and two hands that can close and hold any ninja!<div>One of my tips would be to take the fingers off the mech and close them on the ninjas legs to imagine that it shoots it's fingers! Overall, this is a great set and it is very fun.</div>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"BTZ4435","2012-02-23T19:34:32.673Z","WOW!","<p>This is probablly one of or even the best lego sets of 2012 lego Ninjago sets so far. It has a great piece count, and the mech is gigantic! </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>For this set, the box was amazingly small, even too small for what it was worth. The instructions were absolutally terrible, it was a book, not a manual. Very poor job for the boxing and manual. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Like all Ninjago sets, the parts are very nice. The new heads, the ninja gear, all is good. But, I have bought five of the new Ninjago sets, and they are getting very repetitive. But, if this were to be your first set of this searies, I recomend it, except for the fact it comes with a banana.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are okay I suppose. Pretty average as far as Ninjago sets go. You get Kendo Cole, he's a pretty good one. He has an exclusive staff and a banana? (Don't ask me. I am clueless about the banana.) And you get Fang-Suei. I only cared about his head honestally.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>A very good build. It was a mix of Bionicle, Exo Force, and regular building. Very good!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is a great one! It is very big and has many details. It comes with very posible arms and legs. Best part is, it comes with a flick fire missle.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, a very nice set. It is also a very nice starter set for the less experienced, and also a good start of for the snake theme. I do recomend this product to you.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Malurus","2012-08-27T18:12:54.177Z","Fang-tastic!","Fang-Suei bit something in the junkyard and it turned into the Fangpyre Mech! I think this set is excelent in everything. The head gets annoying, but it's desing is pretty clever.&nbsp;But its playability comes if you got a katana laying around. You can stick them in the feet, the eyes, and in the middle of the head, for tense battles. Overall, it's a good set, though it is a bit over the price range&nbsp;I guessed. But I still would recomend it to a friend.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
