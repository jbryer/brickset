Also, a 12 cent price per piece isn't bad either. It includes 3 minifigures, Kendo Cole, Fangdam, and Lloyd Garmadon. Finally, it contains 415 pieces.</p><p>&nbsp; It is really a great set, with loads of hidden features and many unique pieces. Let's get into some detail -</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp; The box is just as simple as always, with the set picture, item no., and other details on the front, while the back shows some of the features in the set, along with the Serpentine Staff included.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; The sides have advertisements of LEGO Universe (which, just to point out, is now pointless, considering it was&nbsp;canceled this year) and the LEGO Club magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; The instructions are simple to follow, but I did miss a couple of stickers in one step, so that's something to look out for - hiding sticker instructions.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp; There are actually some unique parts in this set. The purple blades on Lloyd's staff are exclusive to this set and one other, 9445 Fangpyre Truck Ambush.</p><p>&nbsp; Some other neat parts are the snake-decal pieces (considering the fact that you used stickers...) *ahem* and the 5 toothed gear plates you get in black. Also, the purple flames and crane arm pieces are pretty cool. Finally, you get 50 dark blue-grey track links, which definitely come in useful for other projects.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp; Kendo Cole - Kendo Cole is just the normal form of the ninja from last year with a new fencing-sort headpiece and breastplate. The armored torso is fine, but the helmet is always coming loose and ""finding its way to a floor near you!"" which gets rather&nbsp;irritating if you ask me. In this case, though, his weapon makes up for the matter, which is pearl gold-colored with pearl silver spikes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Lloyd - Lloyd is wearing the usual hood and cape, with his skeleton-&amp;-green-number-5 torso and short legs. He has a brown staff with a new t-bar hilt in blue-grey, from which protrude 2 purple, jagged blades.</p><p>&nbsp; Fangdam - Fangdam is mainly colored red, with black-and-white accents all about his body. He has two heads, and white arms. His main weapon is the Fangpyre staff, but his red viper minions are included also.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp; The build is simple, but takes awhile. The most challenging part is most likely the boom of the crane. The rest can be easily accomplished by simply following the instructions, no problems, really.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp; To tell ya the truth, I'm kind of proud to have this set in my LEGO room. It stands tall and proud above the other sets on my shelf; but more importantly, it's a blast to play with. From the swinging ball to the entire top half rotating, it keeps you and your little cousin battling for hours! :)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; It's got a great color scheme to it, and looks good with the rest of your Ninjago collection. LEGO adds just the right amount of detail to make a person happy!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>&nbsp; Overall, a great set. If you want a fun LEGO set, and you just happen to have $50 at hand, definitely a recommendation! Also, if you need Technic pieces, or just green pieces, it's got plenty, so still, a great addition to your collection!</div><div>&nbsp; Thanks much for reading my review! I hope I helped you!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Until next time,</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>~LegoRokz112</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
