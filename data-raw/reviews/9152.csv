"beegeedee","2012-11-02T06:33:20.99Z","Good set, if just a little overpriced.","I've recently purchased all the vehicle based mining sets and this is the first I've put together. It's a relatively short build and you can see common build elements in the construction from other sets which I'll mention below.<br><br><b>The Minifig</b><br>There is a single minifigure in this set, a miner with a silver helmet. The helmet has a clear 1x1 round tile for a lamp and sand blue legs. It's only found in 1 other set which is good, #4204 The Mine.<br><br><b>The Accessories</b><br>There are several small bits to make before the main model - a plunger, the dynamite with timer and the sign, all of which take a few seconds to assemble. The first sticker is used here for the sign - it's a shame they didn't print it as the same sign/sticker is also used in 3 other mining sets and would make for a slightly better set. These all fit into a crate<br><br>There's also a boulder which has several studs and 2 pearl gold crystals.<br><br><b>The Main Build</b><br>The 4x4 is fairly straight forward and fairly robust. As mentioned earlier it has several elements in common with other vehicles - the headlight/breaklights are the same as a car in one of the police forest sets, #4441 Police Dog Van and the general wheel arch/side is also quite similar. The wheels are separated from the main plate by extra plates to make it look higher and it's just enough to work. The back of the 4x4 has jumper studs to the crate can be fairly securely attached to the vehicle. Included is a pick-axe and jackhammer.<br><br>There are 2 stickers to be applied to the vehicle itself, the registration plate and a sticker on the roof of the cab.<br><br><b>Spares</b><br>I counted a total of 10 spare pieces of the usual variety, cheese slopes, 1x1 tiles and rounded plates as well as a spare claw and t-piece.<br><br><b>Playability</b><br>On it's own, it's a nice car and with the boulder and it's contents, pretending to blow it up or drill it open could be fun for a kid, at least for a while. The boulder could easily hold more or a second one but then you can always say this about any set.<br><br><b>The Price</b><br>For a set that is just over 100 pieces, 10 Euro is a little steep working out at just under 10c a part, 8 euro would be a better price. It does include 10 spares so that does help.<br><br>Overall, a good little set and if you can get it in a sale, it makes it worth while. It's the cheapest way to get that particular miner which is only found in the mine itself too which is handy for minifig collectors.<br><br>For a few quid more though you can get the #4201 Loader and tipper which has 2 vehicles and 2 figs so overall is a better buy and great for kids who share too.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"MCAdventureCity","2013-12-01T16:41:33.7Z","Perfect value","<p>Here is my review of the smallest of the 2012 mining sets!</p>
<h4>Box</h4><p>The box for this set is fairly large, at 7.5x5.5x2.25 inches. The box depicts a scene of a mine blasting a boulder with his 4x4 truck nearby.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The set contains a 27-page instruction booklet.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set contains 102 parts and a sticker sheet, which come in two bags (the chassis is separate)</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set contains one minifigure, whose&nbsp;whole body (except for the legs) is new.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The accessories are built first,&nbsp;followed by the vehicle, which is constructed in 27 steps.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This set looks great!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I would give this set a 5/5 because it is inexpensive, and is fun to play with.</p><p>Goodbye!</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,4
"JulienQuotidien","2014-10-25T11:29:38.863Z","[FR] Une jouabilit√© restreinte par la taille du set","<p>Dans la (courte) s&eacute;rie mini&egrave;re offerte par Lego en 2012, voici le set de base : un v&eacute;hicule, une minifig et quelques accessoires. Pour un prix peu &eacute;lev&eacute;, il ne fallait pas s&#39;attendre &agrave; mieux !</p>

<p>Ma fille de cinq ans a construit le v&eacute;hicule en une demi-heure. Pas de difficult&eacute; particuli&egrave;re mais au final, un chouette 4x4.</p>

<p>La minifig est plut&ocirc;t sympathique, avec une belle chemise de travail !</p>

<p>Pas mal d&#39;accessoires qui rentrent dans le sc&eacute;nario de la bo&icirc;te : arriv&eacute;e du 4x4, d&eacute;couverte du rocher, dynamitage apr&egrave;s s&eacute;curisation du site et, enfin, extraction des pierres pr&eacute;cieuses.</p>

<p>Malheureusement, cela s&#39;arr&ecirc;te l&agrave;. On imagine bien qu&#39;il ne faut pas s&#39;attendre &agrave; plus pour une petite bo&icirc;te. Mais on &eacute;tendera donc les capacit&eacute;s de notre brave mineur vers la r&eacute;paration ou la construction !</p>

I have always found myself wandering to the self with this set on it in the store and in my collection. It is a nice little yellow truck with some storge in the back and it comes with some tools and a boulder. The Minifigure is a nice one for City. I would highly suggest this set to an Lego&nbsp;City or Lego car collectors or Kid who wants a nice truck for a good price in there collection.</p>
