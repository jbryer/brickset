"Karpp_e_diem","2012-06-22T04:25:06.377Z","All about playability.","This set is composed of a little loader and a little tipper(hence the title), that are quite reminiscent of older building sets as they are small, built with relatively few pieces and more about playability than anything else. The first that came into my mind was the old dig'n dump (http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6581-1), although the loader is closer to the Lanscape loader.&nbsp;http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6512-1<div><br></div><div>The build is simple. You start with the figurines- one has a beige working suit, the other a blue one. It wasn't needed, but it ads a nice variety: they could simply have used the same for both. ANd they have back printing, too!</div><div>The faces are nice- and I think they are new: one is sweating (it's warm in the mines!), the other one has stubbles and scratches. The clou however are the helmets, and they do not disappoint. They are gorgeous.</div><div><br></div><div>Then comes a little explosion sign (sticker unfortunately- luckily, there are very few stickers.), a time bomb, both are simple and elegant. The rock has little parts, and two pearl gold crystals, which is actually as many as the much bigger 2012 mining truck (http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4202-1) has!</div><div><br></div><div>Then comes the vehicles, and it's a simple and fast build. This is not to say it's a bad one: there's a bit of snotting, and a few elegant ideas, like the rear mirrors.</div><div><br></div><div>There are quite a few bigger pieces, so despite the seemingly high price per piece, you get something for your money. It definitely feels so. Otherwise, nothing all that special. The pieces are nice, and usefull, without blowing your mind. Kudos for the crytals though.</div><div><br></div><div>In the end, I'd say the model is like the builds we know from our childhood: using few pieces to do a lot, and a ton of playability. It is, however, updated enough in the details and build to keep up with today's models- though it's seriously refreshing to see something so seemingly simple. I give it 5 despite the 4 it should objectively get judging from the other points I gave because of these reasons: it's a loveable, small little set with a both classic, and modern feel.</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4

The gold crystal pieces are nice, as are the boulders and dynamite, but everything else is just so bland. It&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s actually pierced well which is a rarity for city, and the figures are fine, but that&#39;s about it. Unless you have a special attachment to this set, be it nostalgia or a desire for completion, this is an easy pass.</p>
