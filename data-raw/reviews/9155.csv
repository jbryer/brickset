<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I've never done any mining but already I can see that what is depicted on the box is absurdly dangerous. &nbsp;TLG placed three sticks of dynamite next to a boulder which is sitting between the excavator and semi truck. &nbsp;One of the miners is practically touching this more-or-less-literally-ticking-time-bomb (the dynamite's fuse is lit). &nbsp;To top it off, the excavator has an auger attachment, spinning, right above the boulder. &nbsp;Which, keep in mind, is seconds away from being blown to&nbsp;smithereens by the dynamite. &nbsp;At least the miner has on his safety glasses.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_city_4203_04_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I'm not a proper Lego nerd so I don't get super worked up about parts. &nbsp;However, there are two clear 1x1 pieces (the ""headlamp"" on the miner's helmet) w/o a stud on top that are included and I haven't seen those before. &nbsp;Could be handy, perhaps, where flush ""headlights"" are needed for a MOC pre-80's car or truck. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>There's also the ""gold"" (although it's an odd color for something supposed to be gold, though) pieces, nine of 'em. &nbsp;Plus the dynamite which could come in handy for all sorts of jail-breaks, quick city redesigns, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>I initially though I was unhappy with the tag trailer but in retrospect... there's no way something could be that long that wasn't one piece. &nbsp;The underside of the trailer is reinforced so clearly Lego was worried that it would sag... and that's when it's just one piece, much less if it was composed of multiple pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_city_4203_03_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Two, obviously. &nbsp;The guy in the mining helmet has his shirt half-unbuttoned. &nbsp;Also, on his back, he's got a little tool belt with a rock hammer poking out. &nbsp;Nice touch. &nbsp;The guy running the excavator has a five-day-old beard and a back support/brace. &nbsp;He's also arching one of his eyebrows, probably thinking ""that dynamite that's about to go off is going to absolutely ruin my afternoon.""</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special, really. &nbsp;It's good fun, as always, but wasn't complicated. &nbsp;Methodical as always. &nbsp;My only comment is the stickers, my gods, the stickers. &nbsp;Twelve of them, if I've counted correctly. &nbsp;That's an absurd number; it's like doing an Airfix model.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks pretty good. &nbsp;I like the arm on the excavator. &nbsp;The semi is the same design used for 4434 and, I'm guessing, others. &nbsp;It works though and means your trucks are going to be&nbsp;interchangeable&nbsp;which is nice.</p><p><br></p><p><span><span>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_city_4203_01_s1.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_city_4203_02_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I've never been disappointed by a Lego set and there's nothing new in that regard here. &nbsp;It's probably a touch on the expensive side but considering that you get the truck, tag trailer, and the excavator plus a couple of decent minifigs, the price is ok. &nbsp;I definitely think this has some playability as well. &nbsp;The arm on the excavator is fun to play with and I know that little three-stick set of dynamite will get used as well.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
