"weekend3990","2015-10-05T16:00:51.747Z","Gold mine","<p>This lego city gold mine is a great addition to any lego city fan&#39;s mining sets. &nbsp;The detail on this set is fantastic&nbsp;and it comes with 3 vehicles. ( the truck, the mining thing, and the tram)</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Great detail on this set</p>

<p>Works well with the &nbsp;4202 mining truck set</p>

<p>Comes with 4 minifigures&nbsp;wearing cool miners helmets</p>

<p>The conveyor&nbsp;belt moves and you can use the crane to move the gold and rocks around.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>May be hard for young children to build as some parts are small and hard to put together.</p>

<p>What is the point of the door on the side of the mine???</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I&nbsp;give the set 4/5</p>

"matthew1208","2016-07-27T02:59:22.797Z","A Great Set","<p>The set 4204-1, is a great set to have. It has a lot of great features such as the moving crane, the conveyor belt, and the mini mine cart.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions were well put together and you could really tell where everything went.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts were ok I wish it had less block pieces. It would have better to build the more blockly parts with smaller bricks. Otherwise it has a lot of great pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minfigs&nbsp;were great they had lots of detail.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was great and fun to put together. I would say I wish there was some better use of parts in the main model. The cars though were great. I love the pickup, I loved how you were able to dump things out of the back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I loved all the mini builds that came along with it and the main build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I loved this set. Great price per piece. I would recommend&nbsp;this set to young builders that love building and to more advanced builders.&nbsp;</p>

"LEGODUDE1","2018-04-24T02:50:34.153Z","Old But Good.","<p>The Mine is a pretty good set, considering how long ago it came out. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60188-1/Mining-Experts-Site"">Mining</a><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60188-1/Mining-Experts-Site""> Experts Site (Set 60188)</a>&nbsp;is a bigger set, but not as playable. I especially enjoyed the conveyor belt, which is a key part to the whole thing. The drill and the train are also very good, and the LEGO group certainly did a good job on designing the claw.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In City sets we don&#39;t often know the names of minifigures. With the size of this set, you would be thinking there would be more minifigures to get the job done, but surprisingly, there are only four. (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4204-1/The-Mine"">You can see the pictures of them by clicking on these words.</a>)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some unusual parts included in this set, like the claw, conveyor belt, and drill. What seems to occur a lot in LEGO sets is that the unusual and uncommon pieces serve an important role in the structure and playability of the model, and The Mine would just not be the same without these important elements. The string is always tricky for me to get on, so my parents often help me. I have not gotten a LEGO set with string for a long time, but I used to get them quite often. I guess I&#39;m not jinxed anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of all the Lego sets I&#39;ve owned so far, I&#39;d say this one serves as the most enjoyable to play with. It has a track, drill, truck, conveyor belt, crane, though the dynamite function isn&#39;t as good as the one in the new&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60184-1/Mining-Team"">Mining Team</a>&nbsp;set. Otherwise, the set is great!</p>

<p>I love Lego City sets, even though I&#39;ve gotten into the licensed themes like Batman, DC Comics, Star Wars, and Harry Potter. This set is very good, even though it came out in 2012. I love this set, and it was a real surprise when I got it as a birthday present. Others probably think the same, and I hope others also find this review helpful.</p>

"nate_the_lego_great","2017-11-26T20:47:58.95Z","lego city: The mine-great set","<p>Boom! The mine was a great set. it was fun to build and i could play with it a lot. I enjoyed building it.&nbsp;It was a great experience! The pieces fit perfectly and the instructions were clear. It was a great set to play with and a great set to display! when i had friends or relatives over, they all loved seeing it and commented on how nice it looked on my shelf. I loved the little yellow train. It was fun to move around on the tracks. The drill truck and the goldmine were also fun. i loved driving the drill and spinning it. When i spun it, the gold nuggets would tumble&nbsp;down onto the ground. It was great! the crane and conveyor are always fun and so is the dump truck. the vault was good, but it fell apart when i was building it. It is still fragile, but i love the door. I really loved the mine. it was a great build and is fun to play with.&nbsp;</p>

"Brick1","2020-06-18T20:10:40.92Z","Brilliant!","<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 4 minifigures, all of them wearing different workmen attires, with their mining helmet being their only uniformity. I would&#39;ve enjoyed 2 more minifigures personally, especially for such a big set. The first minifigure I think they should&#39;ve added is a security guard with a radio. I think the below torso would&#39;ve been great.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=973pb0277c02&amp;ccName=4275339#T=C&amp;C=85"">https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=973pb0277c02&amp;ccName=4275339#T=C&amp;C=85</a></p>

<p>The second minifigure they should&#39;ve added is someone to drive the train. This minifigure would still wear a mining helmet but maybe a different colour, his torso would ideally have a reflective vest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 2 vehicles and a train. First the truck. The truck has a very nice colour scheme, and can hold lots of rubble. The cab is just a standard Lego City truck cab but the cargo bed has a very smart use of those panel pieces. The rear of the cargo bed opens and the whole bed tips up to empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second vehicle is the mobile drill. This vehicle is based around a play system but is able to disguise it quite well. This vehicle is still able to hold 1 minifigure off-set and still has space for some modest engine detail behind the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Train</strong></p>

<p>The train goes a surprising distance into the imaginary &quot;mine&quot; located behind the crane. The train is only 4 studs wide but it still manages to have a good level of detail. The train consists of 2 carriages. The first carriage is the locomotive, it has space for 1 minifigure to sit centrally a nice grill with 2 old fashion looking headlights as well as a very smart piece used for the windscreen and a binocular piece used as a horn. The second carriage is a very simple cargo carrying car, with 2 sides that are capable of lowering to allow easy access for loading/unloading cargo. This set would&#39;ve benefited from 1 more cargo carrying car.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Mine</strong></p>

<p>The actual Mine itself is the highlight of the set. Aside from it using some pretty large prebuilt rock pieces, it is a pleasure to build, and even more fun to play with. At the far left is the safe, which has some nice detail on the blastproof door. Next to that is the opening for the train, and above that is the crane, which can rotate 360 degrees and pick up discarded rubble, which it can drop right onto a working conveyor belt! Definitely one of the highlights of the set! The conveyor belt runs&nbsp;right&nbsp;overtop of the tunnel entrance and down into the&nbsp;truck (provided). Underneath the conveyer belt is another cool play feature. If you spin the drill on the mobile drill vehicle, you can break through the plate layer and into the mine! This set is amazing for playability!</p>

<p><b>Extra&#39;s</b></p>

<p>This set comes with a wide range of extras. It comes with a couple of pickaxes, drills, plunger type detonators and dynamite, as well as &quot;warning explosives&quot; signs and &quot;do not pass&quot; barriers. This set also comes with lots of gold&nbsp;chunks, large &quot;breakable boulders&quot; as well as lots of 1x1 brick round in dark grey, light grey and brown meant to represent rubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This set is definitely worth getting!</p>
