As our first of this type, I thought it was a neat set.&nbsp; However in comparison to previous Advent Kits I've seen this one is somewhat disappointing. I was hoping for more interactivity but this set seems bent on the tree catching fire... Too much fireman stuff and not enough toys &amp; games for the two child minifigures.<br></p>",TRUE,2,4,2,2,2
"Legolijntje","2013-01-19T10:25:16.86Z","An average advent calender","<p>This is my review of the advent calender<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As all LEGO advent calenders, the box looks like a normal box, but it contains a plastic container inside. Every day has its own compartment in the plastic tray. The tray is very useful to sort and store LEGO after Chritmas. So don't throw it away!</p><p>The set doesn't contain real instructions, but every day has its own picture that shows how to build that day's model.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The set has a great collection of parts. A bit less of everything most of the times, but it are good parts. Especially the new brick engraved bricks are nice.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set has 7 minifigs: <br></p><ul><li>3 firefighters</li><li>2 kids</li><li>a mechanic <br></li><li>and of course a Santa Claus.</li></ul><p>For some reason, there was 1 firemen where I got like 4 helmets. I don't know if that's an mistake or not, but it is a nice find.</p><p>It's also nice to see how Lego not only puts males in the set, but also females; 1 female firefighter and 1 girl.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build isn't very special. Everyday a little model, sometime a minifig. Nothing more to note here.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model has a lot of playability. With the minifigs combined with all the little things you can create a lot of stories to play.</p><p>It's a bit too fire themed, in my opinion. Too much that has to do with the new fire series from LEGO City. A bit more christmas would be better, since this is an advent calender.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's a nice model. A bit of an average advent calender, but certainly not a bad one. The price may be a bit high, but you can often find the calenders cheaper in other stores then S@H.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
