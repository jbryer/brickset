"syslam","2012-07-03T01:58:23.997Z","Much better than the previous hospital version","<p>This is my pleasure to be the first one to review this set.</p>
<p>This hospital contains;</p>
<p>A. The main building: for the&nbsp;first floor, in the right&nbsp;side is a garage&nbsp;in which the ambulance parking inside, entrance in the middle, and admission hall on the left with 2 chairs and an admission counter with a computer, keyboard and a red mug. On the second floor, from the left there is the ward with 2 beds and a machine monitoring the vital signs, a passage in the middle to the helicopter platform just over the garage. The building sits on 2 16x16 green plates, with bunch of grass and a wooden seat outside.</p>
<p>B. The ambulance: a 4-stud wide one just enough to admit a stretcher (without wheels for the latest version). Small but at least decent enough to be an ambulance instead of the small vehicle holding only one person in the last version. </p>
<p>C. The helicopter: 6-stud wide spacious enough for one minifig and another stretcher. Much more decent than the small helicopter in the last version which the stretcher lay aside the helicopter with the danger of dropping the patient in the air! Outlook of the helicopter is sleek. </p>
<p>D. Minifigs: a patient in green and blue which is meant to injure himself by slipping over the banana skin and bump his head to wait for the ambulance. Helicopter pilot in red uniform and deep blue jeans and helmet, female ambulance driver with red uniform, red jeans and blue cap, and doctor with blue syringe, blue surgical gown and white coat. The uniforms for the health professionals are impressive.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Functional and decent helicopter and ambulance 
<li>Building is of good asthetical design 
<li>Minifigs look sleek 
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>NO OPERATING THEATRE! How come an emergency hospital does not have an operating theatre? A simple way of making one is: move the counter and chairs to the middle room for the entrance, removing the larger radar disk with the transparent cone to attach to the ceiling of the original admission hall, use the 2x2 grey slopes to support one of the stretchers, move the machine and drip stand to the room and it makes the operating theatre. 
<li>Helicopter platform too small for the helicopter and it seems the helicpoter will fall easily or crush the ceiling of the garage</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall it is a good set when compared to the previous version. I got this in a shop selling lego for $438 HK dollars (about $56US dollars) and is of great value.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,5
"What_Sup_Lego_Fans","2012-07-07T20:44:19.113Z","4429 Helicopter Rescue - Not bad compared to last hospital","<p>The 4429 Helicopter Rescue set, which is part of the medical subtheme, contains 425 pieces and 4 minifigures. Here are the ups and downs to this set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very good value for money.</li><li>Rooms are very spacious with doors connecting to the helicopter pad and garage.</li><li>Way better than the last hospital.</li><li>The helicopter was a very good idea rather than having a couple of ambulances.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Ambulance is very small compared to the 4431 Ambulance.</li><li>Ambulance lacks in size and design.</li><li>1 more minifigure would make this set a excellent set.</li></ul>
<p>Since that ambulance is a letdown, you can still add the 4431 Ambulance and other sets if LEGO are still going to release any other medical sets this year.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"Zapp_Brannigan","2012-07-31T14:29:54.79Z","Too small, ill-proportioned, lacks details","In the last 25 years, only 3 hospitals have come into existence in the City/Town theme. They are 6380 Emergency Treatment Center from 1987, 7892 Hospital from 2006, and now 4429 Helicopter Rescue from 2012. The first hospital (6380) was excellent and received universal acclaim, and the second one (7892) was a disaster. The question remains, does this hospital exceed its predecessors? The answer is, it is just as problematic as the last hospital, and there are several reasons for that.<div><br></div><div>The set comes with 4 minifigures, a doctor, helicopter pilot, paramedic (female), and patient. It also comes with a syringe and banana peel which the man slipped off of and injured himself. Vehicles include a small ambulance and oversized helicopter.</div><div><br></div><div>The front yard includes a nice park bench, plus a shrub and hospital sign. A walkway leads up to the main entrance.</div><div><br></div><div>The main hospital is only two floors high. The first floor is the reception desk with cup and computer, plus there are two chairs where patients can wait. There is also a garage to accommodate the ambulance. The second floor includes two beds, a computer screen, and an infusion bottle. A door leads outside to the helipad. Patients can be transported directly from the helicopter to the operating beds.</div><div><br></div><div>Aside from the neat design of the windows and red frame, the design of building is quite disappointing. First of all, it is too small to be considered a hospital. I understand that the 6-stud depth design is standard for many City buildings, but for a hospital, it should be greater in order to accommodate bedding and equipment. Moreover, two floors do not do justice for a hospital; there should be at least 4-5. The garage is also quite brutal with all the open spaces, and lack of walls or windows at the sides and rear.</div><div><br></div><div>On its own, the helicopter is okay, but placed adjacent to the hospital, it quickly becomes obvious that it is way too big for the building; the rear of the helicopter sticks out of the back quite severely. There is absolutely no room for the paramedics to unload the stretcher. Either reduce the size of the helicopter to a more proportionate size, or increase the size of the hospital significantly such that it does not become ridiculous!</div><div><br></div><div>The large green 16x16 plates are also inappropriate for the overall design. You would think that a vehicle would be parked on a paved driveway and not grass!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this set was a let-down and I am very disgusted with the lack of thought, effort, and practicality that is provided. I know it takes time and resources to develop LEGO sets, but here it is evident that little effort and consideration were put into this set. I only give this set credit for being a hospital (which are rare these days). The price is steep $74.99 CAD. I strongly recommend against getting this set, it is not at all worth it and almost insulting to have us wait this long only to have LEGO release a sub-standard hospital. I certainly hope that the next hospital will have much more to offer. However, I am glad that LEGO was honest and did not call the set a hospital.</div><div><br></div><div>I apologize for sounding harsh, but unfortunately it is the reality.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,3

"tisi","2012-11-04T12:33:55.28Z","Could be improved, but still the best hospital ever!","<p>LEGO made four buildings under the 'Medical' subtheme: 6364 Paramedic Unit in 1980, 6380 Emergency Treatment Centre in 1987 and 7892 Hospital in 2006, and this one in 2012. The first two sets are neat, but a little bit too classic, and the third one...er...why is it on a hill? Anyway, this one is my favourite. Details below.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Huge box, as usual, but almost full of LEGO! Yay! On the box, we can follow a small story: an unlucky guy (let's call him Jack) slips on a banana (as in the cartoons), and the ambulance and the helicopter is on the move to rescue him. Jack gets to the hospital, and the doctor heals him. There are three instructions: one for the ambulance, one for the helicopter and one for the building. A small sticker sheet included too.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing interesting, standard City parts except the blue syringe, the new kind of stretcher and the doctor's parts. Every type and every colour can be found there (the plant, the computer element, the chair and so on), so they can be useful in the future. But unfortunately, there are some panels too. Those cannot be useful at all.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are four of them: a doctor, a paramedic, a helicopter pilot and a patient. Great assortment, but could be improved with 1-2 nurses. The doctor is the best of them: the whole minifig is awesome, the hair, the head, the torso and the legs make an almost perfect unison (even if I hate this head). I like the paramedic too: her torso is very nice, and the other pieces are OK too (+1 female in our city!). But I'm not so content with the pilot: he is just the same as the forest fire pilot! Very disappointing! LEGO could have made a new torso, or just could have used the older one. Jack is a nice-looking guy: he wears a neat pullover with grey trousers, and he has the brown standard hair. The idea of the patient is good: it increases the playability and adds a new citizen to our city.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I go forward as the instructions do.</p><b>The Ambulance<br></b>Similar to the standard City cars, but on the front there is a 2x4 slope and its fender is different (but cool!). A small glass panel divides the injured one from the driver. And the space where the injured one is - there are no studs! The stretcher fits in perfectly, and you can put him/her in by a trapdoor at the back. The sticker on its side is very cool - I think it shows that it's an urgent transport. Other reviewers write that it's too small, there are no details (where should those be?) and so on, but I still like this neat ambulance.<br><br><b>The Helicopter<br></b>Well, this is a little bit disappointing. I don't know if it is too wide or too short, but it looks a bit strange. Standard pieces, nice design (the siren and the front light are very good touches) , but it's still strange. Why haven't made TLG a 7742-like helicopter with the same design? It would have been better, and they could have improved:<br><b><br>The Building<br></b>Yes, it could have been improved. It is very neat, but bare. It consists of two floors: the ground floor consists of the garage (perfect for 6-studs-wide vehicles too, and the light is a good touch) and the hospital's ground floor with the waiting room with two chairs and reception (computer and cup on the desk!). On the first floor there is the heliport (the letter 'H' and some lights can be seen) and a hospital room (two beds, a computer-like machine, infusion and medical records). On the top there are some radars and antennas, and small accessories included around the hospital (plant, bench and a column with light and some information). They could have added a clinic/consulting room or a surgery.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The whole set itself looks very great - the three sub-models make together a very good and playable set. Nice design, good ideas, lots of accessories, but I have to repeat myself: COULD BE IMPROVED.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The best City hospital ever (in my opinion), but not the best that LEGO can make. Pros are the great value for money, the great assortment of pieces, the nice minifigs, the good design and the high playability. The cons are the panels, the missing nurses, the disappointing pilot, the strange helicopter and the too small building. All in all, great set.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar :D<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5

It quite literally looks half-finished.<div><br></div><div>*The ambulance: Incredibly tiny and squat by modern LEGO vehicle standards, with a narrow slot windshield that is far more appropriate for a sports car than an ambulance.</div><div><br></div><div>*The helicopter: Appears to have been cut in half with a hacksaw. Freakishly out of proportion.</div><div><br></div><div>Building design: The red pillars framing a glass front wall are a very neat touch, but the big, empty, non-walled garage is not only a wasted space, it's hardly realistic. By shoehorning a garage into an already-small building, LEGO is basically just phoning it in. ""Let's take the police station, cut it in half and call it a day."" This leaves a tiny, narrow two-bed treatment area upstairs and an office desk below. The roof of the garage is, as per usual for such buildings, used as a helipad - but in this case, the helicopter is so out of proportion to the hospital that it looks utterly ridiculous if ""landed"" there.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm guessing LEGO was afraid to make the set a full USD$100 ""flagship,"" but even an $80 price point would have gone a long way toward making the set much more realistic and more playable. An increased piece count would have allowed a larger building and more proportional helicopter, at least.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Fortunately, the fundamental design of the set is sound and the parts it includes are quite usable, which means that it's easily MOCed. I purchased two and combined them: stretching the helicopter, punching out the building's width and converting the garage space into an emergency room with a modularized roof.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Also, the minifigs are quite nice - the paramedic even has truly-reflectorized printing on her safety vest. The printing on the doctor's legs is, as has been mentioned, ""off,"" color-wise - the white of the jacket wasn't opaque enough to truly blank out the blue plastic. That's a minor quibble, however.</div><div><br></div><div>On the whole, though, this set is rightly viewed as a disaster out of the box.
