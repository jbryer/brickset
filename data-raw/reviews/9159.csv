"brix","2012-06-18T14:25:59.327Z","A great little set","<p>I bought this set yesterday in the Brighton Lego shop after completing the London to Brighton bike ride. Here goes...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Not really much to say - an&nbsp;image of the set with a spooky background and the swamp creature labelled in the corner. The instruction were folded but I guess they had to be to fit them into the box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A few nice parts in this set. The main one of course being the moonstone in a flourescent yellow/ green with some nice seewead printing. Other&nbsp;good parts include the sand green 1x2 piece with a clip, 1x4&nbsp;light grey&nbsp;piece with only 2 studs, one on each end usually used in modular buildings, silver grill pieces and a dark green, rubber seaweed piece.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Frank Rock</p><p>The figure is very cool with the quiff hairpiece worn by the mechanic from series 6 CMF. He has a double sided face, one with sun glasses and chuffed expression, the other with a tough, stern expression, both with plenty of detail, especially the scratches and stubble.</p><p>The&nbsp;torso piece is very nice with fur trimmings similar to those on CMF series 3's pilot. The only negative is that the printing bare chest part is a slightly off-yellow due to the dark brown plastic showing through underneath. There is also back printing of more fur trimmings and 2 buckles.</p><p>The legs are very cool in the new olive green. Once again, the printing is very nice and detailed with metal plates on the knees, a chain and 2 green things (not sure what they are, maybe mini bombs?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Swamp Creature</p><p>The best figure i've seen in a while - it has highly detailed scale and seaweed printing on both front and back of the torso along with rib cage and spine printing too.</p><p>The legs also have this same level of detail with continuation of some of the seaweed from the torso.</p><p>The lime green head is very cool with huge yellow eyes and a down-turned, vicious looking mouth. On the back of the head are some scales as well as a few on the front. </p><p>The fishy head piece in green completes the figure. It adds the detail of the fins whilst still showing off the eyes and mouth of the head underneath. To make this piece separately was a very good idea because it means you can turn the swamp man into a costume for a minifigure by replacing the monster head with a yellow lego man one and you can replace the&nbsp;hands too. The finished product fits right in with the other suit guys from the CMF series.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It takes around 10 minutes to build if that. There is hardly any repetition which is great but then there's hardly any building full stop. Basically, a quick, very simple build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is very cool. I like that there are two mini models in this set and the moving propeller and flick fire missiles are nice features for kids - I just don't like how they seem to be including the flick fire missiles in everything. For the money, this set is excellent - if the figures were being bought separately in CMF packets, they'd be £2 each so when you put in that way, the swamp vehicle and swampy thing are only £1 in total! :)</p><p>People are much more likely to buy this set at this kind of price so keep up these prices LEGO!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, a great set for the money and I highly recommend it to start off this great series!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Zrath","2012-07-05T18:06:44.057Z","Creature From The Generic Lagoon","It's a small set. It's got some cool parts.<br>The Elvis/greaser-style monster fighter minifig is pretty cool.<br>The airboat has one basic flaw: the propeller actually touches the ground, so you can't spin it. The designer of the set should have placed the hub higher.<br>The swamp critter minifig also has one basic flaw: the eyeholes in the helmet don't quite line up with the eyes printed on the face. That's a minor quibble though.<br>So yeah, it's not a bad little set.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"CapnRex101","2012-06-21T17:36:51.453Z","9461 - The Swamp Creature","<p>This is the smallest of the Monster Fighters sets which is not packaged in a polybag, but despite the small size, this is a great set in my opinion! The two Minifigures are both excellent and the two little models are not bad either. There is plenty of playability here as well and this set is actually very good considering its size. Read on and discover why this is one of my favourite Monster Fighters sets of them all so far...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Being an impulse set, the box is absolutely tiny, but it still has some nice artwork! Frank Rock is speeding across a lake towards the Swamp Monster's hideout on his lovely twin hulled Airboat while the evil Monster prepares to try and fend him off with a spear. The Moonstone is glowing between the two Minifigures with a few reeds and various creatures surrounding it. One of the flick fire missiles has been launched from Frank Rock's boat and is soaring towards the hideous creature which protects the bright green Moonstone.</p><p>The set is displayed on a unique background, behind the Swamp Monster is a steamy green swamp which is ideally suited to this figure. Frank Rock and the Airboat however are on a lake and around him there is some white foam and in the distance one can see some trees and the full moon. In the bottom right corner the Swamp Creature itself is shown with the stone and along the top, bats are forming a dark background for the creepy Monster Fighters logo. Overall, a suitably eerie design.&nbsp;</p><p>The back of this tiny box shows the set from another angle as well as demonstrating the features. A small comic strip showing Lord Vampyre pinching the Moonstone from the Swamp Creature runs along the top of the box which is nice while there is a shot of the Monster Fighters and the Monsters going head to head at the bottom.</p><p>The instructions share the same cover design as the box and I found no mistakes and thankfully had no missing pieces. It must be folded to fit into the box which leaves a big crease in it but this can quickly and easily be flattened out by placing it under a heavy object of some sort to keep it in the best condition.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For such a small set the number of useful or rare parts is quite astonishing! We get five excellent metallic grilles, three dark grey revolvers, and two dark red cones which are quite uncommon. There is a black&nbsp;propeller, and four translucent blue smooth plates which go beneath the vehicle so are not visible. There is a bit of dark green including the weed piece and a nice fish as well. Of course the highlights though are the bright green (almost yellow) Moonstone, Frank Rock's hairpiece, and finally the top of the Swamp Monster's head which a is brand new and&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;mould! In a kit of only seventy parts, this is just about as good as you are going to find in any set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two Minifigures&nbsp;included&nbsp;in this set, one Monster Fighter, and one Monster. I will begin with the hero of this set who ha come to capture the Moonstone.</p><p>The fantastic <b>Frank Rock</b> is a great addition to this set and is a really nice figure. He has plenty of detail and features that nice Pompadour hairstyle piece which we first saw in Series 6 of the Collectable Minifigures with the Mechanic. The piece included for this figure is identical to the one seen with that Collectable Minifigure, cast in jet black with no printing. It suits this character really well and I am glad that Lego chose to use this piece rather than anything else. His head is double sided, one side shows a face with some stubble, a few minor bruises and scars, and a rather serious expression. On the other side the stubble is also printed, but this time Frank Rock is wearing some large black and silver sunglasses which are rather nice. He has a big grin on this side of his head which suits him very well and I like a great deal.</p><p>His torso is printed with a brown leather bomber jacket which has some tan trim and a couple of pockets. Two silver&nbsp;buckles&nbsp;are also just about visible and underneath his jacket is a white shirt with an open neck, allowing some flesh to be seen. The shirt has some staining on it and a few nice folds in the cloth which is superb. The back of the torso is printed with his jacket and two more buckles, as well as a few more creases. His arms are bare so are yellow as are his hands. His legs are highly detailed, he even has hip printing! This consists of a brown belt with a bit of silver highlighting on a dark tan surface which is great. His legs too are cast in dark tan and are also printed with lots of detail. There is a metallic chain, some little pockets strapped on to his thigh, and some knee pads which consist of both brown padding, and two metal plates with some studs in them. He carries two simple revolvers and you get a spare one as well.</p><p>The best of the two Minifigures however would have to be the bizarre <b>Swamp Creature</b> in my opinion as it is a very interesting figure and one which I love! The top of his head is formed from a brand new piece which is lovely. It is not printed at all but the green mould is so detailed that it does not require any! He has a fin along the top of the piece which also runs down the back of his head and the two large fins. There are two holes for his huge yellow eyes and these allow the component to act as a mask for a&nbsp;Halloween costume which could be worn by somebody in your Lego City!&nbsp;</p><p>The head piece is cast in lime green and is also very nice, with lots of detailed printing. Most prominent on the face are his gigantic eyes which are mostly yellow, but also have black slit shaped pupils with a red outline. He has a small mouth with pointed teeth and some wrinkles, as well as a huge number of green scales on the front and back! The torso is mostly standard green in colour with more scales and some bony outlines. His spine and ribs are marked out on the back and there are yet more scales, while his arms are green and his hands are light green. Also he has the top of the garment he wears around his hips made of seaweed which is great. This is continued on his lime green hips and the top of his legs too. His scaly skin is also printed on here to complete the Minifigure. He carries just one&nbsp;accessory, a dark brown spear which is an appropriate weapon for the character.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is of course extremely short as this is only a small set. It took approaching ten minutes from start to finish and did not really feature any interesting techniques at all. But for a model of this size you cannot really expect any more!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When this set is assembled it is superb. The tiny swamp section is nice with some translucent green tiles creating a watery feel to the area and a stone plinth on which the lime green Moonstone is displayed with some weed behind it. This Moonstone, unlike most of the others, is glow in the dark and it looks very good indeed. There is a green frog and a fish on here which is held by a sand green clip, a rare piece.</p><p>The Airboat is excellent too. It features a rotating propeller at the back, two flick fire missiles, and two clips for storing Frank Rock's weapons which are useful. A brown seat is found on top of the boat and there are two levers with which the driver controls the vehicle. The colour scheme is a bit odd, mostly tan, brown and black. The Airboat is in fact a partial catamaran as towards the front of the vehicle the hull is split in to two sections which makes the design a little more interesting.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a set which I recommend, at this price it is a must have for Monster Fighters fans as it includes an exclusive Monster, and this is by far the cheapest way of getting Frank Rock. Not only are the figures great though, the set itself is not bad either, I particularly like the Airboat which is sturdy and can be skimmed around without fear of it breaking at all which&nbsp;contributes&nbsp;to the playability.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"bricksan","2012-06-26T09:06:43.373Z","The Swamp Creature","<div>The sets are still not on general sale but this theme could be the dark horse of the year in terms of success. I have always liked the classic Monsters and shows like the Munsters and Addams Family, so when I found out this theme was coming out I was very excited but in a way the arrival of Lord of the Rings and Friends this year has over shadowed this theme. That was until they released news on the exclusive Haunted House that is due out in September.</div><div><br></div><div>I bought this for the RRP of £4.99. Which for a small set isn’t bad, I will be purchasing The Mummy set next. Also I am hoping this brings down the prices of the Zombie CMF as it is still fetching around £15 on the second hand market.</div><div><br></div><h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>So as I said this set will set you back £5 in the UK but I reckon that will come down when it goes on general sale. For your money you get 2 minifigs and 70 pieces. I like the fact you get two minifigures as all these sets are attached to the story line, with each monster controlling a moonstone. All the stones combined will give their own awesome powers and it’s down to the Monster Fighters to stop them.</div><div><br></div><div>In this set you get the Swamp Creature who controls &nbsp;the green moonstone and Frank Rock on his swamp boat. The box is black with the swamp creature holding the moonstone in the bottom right of the front and on the back you have various images including the firing of the missiles from the swamp boat as well as the comic strip at the top of the box</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions have the same cover image with the back feature an advert for the LEGO Club, the parts that are included as per the normal, each page has the moon on it which is a nice touch.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is split into two main parts one for the swamp area and one for the boat. Firstly you are tasked with putting the minifigs together, the swamp creature is one of my fav minifigs the scales and detailing are great and I like that they add a mask to finish his look of the eyes are very freaky and also they have added printing to the back of the head. &nbsp;Frank Rock has a double head print and both the torso and legs have printing and the entire outfit are really good.</div><div><br></div><div>The swamp creatures layer is built in 7 stages with each stage adding 1 or 2 new elements to the build. Everything is rather simple and is easy to put together with the final stage is adding the moonstone that also has printing on it. Frank Rock’s Swamp boat then takes 17 stages to put together, again it is a pretty straight forward build with each stage telling you what elements you need and most have been 1-3 new elements per stage. The build is interesting and comes together nicely the addition of firing missiles is a bonus. You also get a place to place his guns while driving the boat.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>Overall this is a very good set for the price. The minifigures in this set alone is worth the price tag and the build is simple but fun, I like the swamp boat and the addition of moonstones in each set makes this theme very playable and appealing to fans of all ages. If the rest of the theme is anything like this set then I am very much looking forward to building the large sets.<br><br>Review on my site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/9461-the-swamp-creature/"">http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/9461-the-swamp-creature/</a></div><div>Images on flickr: &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630297261590/with/7447513784/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630297261590/with/7447513784/</a></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2015-10-31T12:06:41.87Z","Enter the Swamp, if you dare.","<p><strong>Set #9461 The Swamp Creature: </strong>The Monster Fighters Theme is a very interesting design choice for LEGO to create, we have gotten to see a load of new figures and impressive steampunk vehicles. It&rsquo;s a really fun Theme if you&rsquo;re a fan of classic horror movie monsters and steampunk. It also makes a great Halloween Theme to break out every year, which is something LEGO sorely needed after years of making Christmas themed sets for their Winter Village.</p>

<p>Is this small set worth picking up now that Monster Fighters has pretty much been retired though? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box design for Monster Fighters shows hints of spooky things to come in 2015, namely a full moon and a swarm of bats in the top section of the box. Not exactly a nod to Scooby-Doo&rsquo;s famous bat swarm, but people will read into it now that Scooby and the gang have been announced.</p>

<p>That being said this box design was really quite clever, it drew your eye to the set and you found yourself wanting to pick these up. The gloomy looking nighttime forest seen behind the set pictures also added to the fun of this design and the thrill of wanting to collect them all. You also got to see each monster in the lower corner and the specific moonstone that was included in each set. On the back you also had some nice little comic strip images showing a brief story and the features of the set were prominently shown.</p>

<p>The instructions for this set are pretty much build the models and done, no other images except the piece breakdown in the back. No minifigure checklists (because this was made at a time when LEGO wasn&rsquo;t adding it in every theme) and no cross promotional images. Just simple, straight forward build steps which are serviceable. Not too exciting either unfortunately.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The moonstone in this set is pretty much the most unique part, aside from the Minifigure head gear of the titular creature. I don&rsquo;t consider this set to be a decent parts pack for that reason.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>2 Minifigures in this set, one of them unique to this set the other found in this set and a few others.</p>

<p>Frank Rock: Found in two sets, this is the cheapest method of obtaining the Monster Fighter known as Frank. He&rsquo;s a pretty interesting looking figure, he has a double-sided torso wearing a jacket and a grease stained under shirt. Leg printing for monster fighting gear and kneepads and a double-sided face, one side wearing sunglasses the other with them missing.</p>

<p>Considering he&rsquo;s using the mechanic&rsquo;s hair piece from the CMF theme and he does bear a similar look to him; plus he has grease stained clothing, I have to wonder if perhaps he&rsquo;s meant to be the same character? Probably not, but it&rsquo;s fun to imagine. Of note is the two pistols he has for accessories.</p>

<p>Swamp Creature: According to the LEGO Movie this creature is a Master Builder and the big draw for this set. Accessories for him are just a standard Castle Spear and the Swamp Creature moonstone; also found in the Vampyre Castle set.</p>

<p>His printing is very impressive, he&rsquo;s got a double-sided torso, leg printing and a double-sided print on the face, though only one expression. The back head printing is a few scale patterns and very minimal for a back head print. What&rsquo;s great about this minifigure is that he&rsquo;s pretty much all green, this colour is kind of rare when it comes to Minifigures you typically only see green minifigs in Space Themes.</p>

<p>Overall some good minifigs in this set.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Not much to discuss here, you get to build two small models, a swamp boat and a portion of the swamp to house the moonstone. These builds are very quick and not much to talk about, however the swamp boat build is very fun and wouldn&rsquo;t look out of place in the new LEGO City Swamp.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The section of swamp model is a small little build that features a frog, a bit of swampy plant lift, a fish for the creature to eat and a pedestal for the moonstone. It&rsquo;s a very minimal set piece for the Swamp Creature to use as a base and could probably stand to be a bit bigger.</p>

<p>The swamp boat has two flick-fire missiles, two storage clips for Frank&rsquo;s guns and a spinning propeller. It&rsquo;s a very fun little vehicle build that fits in quite nicely with the stable of larger vehicles used by the Monster Fighters. You can have hours of fun playing with it.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say that the biggest draw for this set is the Swamp Creature minifigure and the small swamp boat. Frank Rock is also available in the Ghost Train set, so this is a cheaper alternative to owning him and he is a great looking figure. I just don&rsquo;t like the price for this in Canada. The moonstone is not unique to this set either, the entire point of this Theme was to collect all of the sets to collect all the moonstones. If you bought Vampyre Castle however you got all of the common Moonstones (the only one not in it was the Zombie moonstone.) so honestly I can only somewhat recommend this set. It isn&rsquo;t terrible, it&rsquo;s just lacking a bit in the model and price per piece ratio&hellip; At least in Canada it was. The swamp could have and should have been slightly larger, perhaps with a better hiding place for the moonstone. (Or at least somewhere for the Swamp Creature to sit and enjoy his fishy snack.)</p>
