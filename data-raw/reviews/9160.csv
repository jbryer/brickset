"Odeinoichus","2012-11-15T14:41:18.62Z","Behold the Mash! The Monster Mash","<p>Set # 9462 The Mummy: Welcome to the Monster Fighters Theme, a Theme whose story I haven't followed too much, apparently the Monsters are the good guys? Or at least depending on who you root for.</p>
<p>The Mummy is the set that I chose to introduce myself to the Theme's gimmick, which was glow-in-the-dark and the Moon Stones after picking up the two Polybagged sets from Bricktober. And it's a nice introductory set with some interesting looking Models and fun looking Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the titular character and his chariot. The Mummy is basically the same as Series 3's Mummy design wise, it does&nbsp;offer different colored printing for the skin underneath the wrappings and is missing the arm printing that was used on Series 3's version. I have to wonder if it was originally meant to glow-in-the-dark though and was just changed due to problems with the printing causing the glow function to look off. I don't know, however I think it would have been better if he did glow.</p>
<p>The Mummy is transporting his specific moon stone to Vampyre Castle by use of an Egyptian styled chariot, which uses some great looking colors, dark and lighter browns, a dull orange brick and darker greys. I like the overall design of the model, it really looks like an old-world chariot, if you wanted to you could use an ordinary horse and stick one of your Roman Soldiers or Spartans from your CMF collection on it and it would look great.</p>
<p>The Mummy's moon stone is clear dark purple with an eye symbol on it and looks great as a unique new accessory piece. He also has a big curved sword from the fantasy era castle and two spears are attached to the skeleton horse.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this is basically the same piece from the Fantasy Era Castle sets, only now it's cast in glow-in-the-dark plastic and the glowing function looks truly impressive. And it looks quite menacing with the two flame pieces sticking out of its eyes. Which goes perfectly with the red sinster eyed printing on the mummy's face.</p>
<p>The second Mini-Figure is known as Ann Lee and she is not your typical looking MF, she's got an impressive level of detail on her double-sided torso, apparently wearing a corset underneath her clothing, she also has a clove of garlic hanging off her belt print and a circular necklace piece. Lastly, her double-sided face indicates she's been in some kind of scuffle previously as there is a long noticeable scar down the right side of her face, over her eye. Perhaps Lady Vampyre and she fought previously.</p>
<p>I adore the use of the Cave Woman's hairpiece here, with her carrying extra bolts for her crossbow, one in her hair the other in her hand, it just adds to the uniqueness of this Theme's Mini-Figs. Her vehicle of choice for stealing the moon stone from the Mummy is a small gyro-copter, perhaps it makes less noise.</p>
<p>This model is fairly simple in its deisng and execution, however it's still pretty nifty looking and I love the way the MF looks riding around on it. Overall I'd have to say this set is definitely one worth looking into, and a great set to snag if you're a fan of horror classics with a new twist. The only things wrong with it are minor, firstly the Mummy doesn't glow even though the instructions indicate it should, also the moon stone as far as I know doesn't glow, and lastly; a very minor nit-pick. Why doesn't the Mummy have some kind of reins to use for driving his chariot? A little thing that you could MOC with some spare pieces, however it is a bit curious that LEGO didn't think this monster would need a means of controlling where his mount took him and his chariot. Highly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-26T09:27:53.463Z","9462 - The Mummy","<p>The Mummy was one of the sets which I was least enthusiastic about prior to the release of the Monster Fighters theme, and although it is far from the best model of the series, it is an improvement over what I was expecting. There are a few superb glow in the dark parts here which make the set a little more interesting, and the two Minifigures are excellent, really improving the set as a whole.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is the same size as a standard Star Wars battle pack and the artwork is quite nice, not quite as eye-catching as some others, but decent nevertheless. It shows the Mummy on his horse-drawn chariot wielding a singles large scythe blade while Ann Lee pursues him in her autogyro. The set is shown on a rocky track with a green mist rising around the chariot and some mountains in the distance. As usual the moon is full and a line of bats runs from the moon to form a background of darkness for the Monster Fighters logo. In the bottom right corner is an image of the Mummy carrying his Moonstone.</p><p>The back of the box displays the set from another angle with the features and glow in the dark pieces shown around that. A picture of the heroes and villains of this theme going in to battle is at the bottom of the box and at the top is a small comic strip which shows how Lord Vampyre whisks away the Mummy's Moonstone to add to his fiendish machine.</p><p>The instructions share the same artwork as the box cover and I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces. The instructions are in fact larger than the box so must be folded over to fit in to the container but this crease can be removed by placing the booklet under some kind of heavy object. At the back of the manual are some advertisements for the rest of the sets in this line.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The pieces we get are one of the best things about this small set. There are a large number of useful and rare parts relative to the size of the kit, including an astonishing eleven gold pieces! The large black rotor blade could be useful for you own aeronautical creations and we get two metallic grey harpoon pieces, which are brand new in this colour and are stored in the box on a sprue. A golden scorpion piece is included and the glow in the dark horse is also an outstanding component. There are four dark tan small macaroni parts which are rare and could be quite useful. Finally, there are three dark red jumper plates in the set which are extremely useful and are fairly uncommon in this colour.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The two Minifigures are both superb. The first of these is the only female member of the Monster Fighters, <b>Ann Lee</b>. She is an excellent Minifigure who makes use of the rubbery ginger hair piece from the Cavewoman in the Collectable Minifigures series and it looks fantastic on her. A lot of texture is moulded in to this piece and I have had no problem keeping it on her head unlike some other rubberised parts. Attached to her hair is one of the harpoon bolts included which gives the figure a unique appearance which is great. Ann Lee has a double sided head. Both sides have black eyelashes and eyebrows, a long scar running near he left eye, and some red lipstick. On one face she is smiling, and on the other she has a much more determined expression.</p><p>The torso is highly detailed, a white blouse with an open collar is printed and above the open collar some skin can be seen. She is wearing a pendant with a flower design around her neck and a dark red corset. As usual on female figures, the torso has some feminine curves printed on it. The back of the torso continues this design with some creases and folds in the white fabric, and the back of her corset, where some string can be seen for tightening the garment if necessary. The arms are plain white and her hands are yellow. Her hips are printed with just one tiny detail, the bottom of her red corset. The legs are predominantly medium blue, but are printed with some cloves of garlic and a few wooden stakes for fending off the evil Lord Vampyre. Ann Lee carries two accessories, a metallic grey crossbow, and a harpoon of the same colour to load in to the bow.</p><p>The Monster in this set is the ancient <b>Mummy</b>. This is a simple Minifigure in many ways, but is still wonderful! The head piece is mainly white, and printed on the front with some bandages, but his mouth and red eyes can be seen between the rags along with a bit of his greying skin. This printed area of his head is glow in the dark, along with most of the other printed areas of the Minifigure. The torso has yet more bandages on it which, due to their age, are a little torn and crumpled. Similar printing is seen on the back of his torso, but this area is not glow in the dark unlike the front. His arms and hands are plain white and are left entirely unprinted.</p><p>The legs of the Mummy are also printed with bandages on the top half which are equally tattered as the rest of his bandages and glow in the dark to great effect. He wields one weapon, a dark grey scythe blade which is suited to him very well, although I would have preferred to see one of the Egyptian swords which we got in the Pharaoh's Quest theme.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very brief here, only about ten minutes. It does however use one or two interesting techniques including a great deal of SNOT on the autogyro. As with most of the other Monster Fighters sets, the build is quite easy and mainly consists of standard Lego system building styles, but that makes these models ideal for young children who might struggle with a more complicated build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The set is made up of two vehicles,the first of which is Ann Lee's autogyro. It is a simple vehicle and is a little sparse, but does the job of transporting the hero to retrieve the Mummy's purple Moonstone. It is mainly blue and dark bluish grey and features a large rotor on the top, an engine block at the rear and some levers to control the vehicle. There is a space for one Minifigure to sit beneath the rotor, but it leaves the pilot rather exposed and I am not sure I would feel entirely comfortable with the huge rotor only just above my head! A small clip is found at the front of the vehicle which looks a little odd but the purpose of that will become clear later.</p><p>The Mummy rides a horse&nbsp;drawn&nbsp;chariot which is Egyptian in style, fitting the character nicely. The glow in the dark skeleton horse has flaming eyes and as well as dragging the chariot, it also carries the Moonstone which is held on a golden scorpion piece between two spears. The Moonstone is printed with the eye or Iris, a legendary symbol of the Egyptians and a marvellous design for this stone. The clip I mentioned earlier can fit on to the scorpion and be sued to lift the Moonstone right off the chariot. Unfortunately this feature does not work terribly well unless you actually hold on to the scorpion piece while you clip it on to the autogyro. It would have been far better if the design was more like the hook system seen in set 8631, Jetpack Pursuit from the Agents theme (one of my favourite small sets of all time).</p><p>The chariot itself is mostly dark tan and brown, but also features lots of gold highlights. There are some decorative spikes at the front, and two lamps behind that. Only one Minifigure can stand in the chariot as there are some more gold pieces used inside. At the very back next to the large brown cart wheels are clips on either side of the vehicle on which you can fit the scythe and one other item.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, for such a low price you get quite a lot for your money here and although the Monster is not the most interesting, and the models need some work, I would still recommend this set as, for display, it is very good indeed, especially the chariot, which is an attractive design. There is some playability as well, but the Moonstone capturing feature is not very good at all and rarely works. If they had included a feature more like the one in set 8631, Jetpack Pursuit, this set would get an extra point, but as it is I am going to award this model with...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

<p>The parts included are pretty good here, Propeller blade, Skis, Glow in the dark Skeleton Horse!!, Spears, Golden scorpion, Wagon wheels, Purple rock crystal with a cool gold print.</p>

<p>Building this set was a fun, quick and easy experience, Not much annoying here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures we have Ann Lee, and the Mummy.</p>

<p>Ann Lee is a solid Fig with a nice leg print, A fun hair piece, And a harpoon.Having a Harpoon on your hair must hurt.</p>

<p>The Mummy is a Great looking Minifigure That Glows in the dark very well, And has some incredible Printing.</p>

<p>For the models we have the Carriage and the Helicopter.</p>

<p>The Helicopter is very small and simple but Gets the point across as a helicopter and adds good play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I actually really like the Carriage with the Rock Crystal on the Scorpion, a holder for the Mummy&#39;s sword, though i do prefer how it looks with the Figure holding it.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t put my finger on it, i just like it.&nbsp;</p>
