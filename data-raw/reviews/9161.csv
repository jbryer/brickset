The set contains the typical fare for a set in this range: 2 figures, a small vehicle, and some other small structure, which in this case is a creepy tree which doubles as a hideout for the Werewolf. &nbsp;</p><p>Nothing too spectacular here, the vehicle is pretty standard fare, as is the Monster Fighter it comes with, Major Quinton Steele. &nbsp;The werewolf himself is pretty bland, with the obvious exception of the wolf head, although there is leg printing as well. &nbsp;The most noticeable feature is of course the glow in the dark claw hands.</p><p>the tree is actually quite &nbsp;a mess. &nbsp;while the highlight is five of the small leafs in the new olive green color, much of the rest of the tree seems to be made up of an odd mish-mash of mostly small parts which often seem to serve little to no functional purpose. &nbsp;On the plus side, the end result is quite rugged, and it does provide a lever-operated function that serves to catapult the werewolf out of the tree, presumably onto the car of the passing Major Steele. &nbsp;Overall though, it's kind of a meh design with only minor appeal.</p><p>for me, the best aspect of the set was the quite good price per piece ratio in combination with a very nice collection of parts; some highlights being the above-mentioned olive green leaves, along with 4 trans-orange 1x1 bricks, 3 dark red jumper plates, 3 of the new masonry 1x2 bricks (dark tan), and a load of dark brown: 20 1x2 slopes and 13 1x2 palisade bricks. &nbsp;4 revolvers aren't bad either</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Werewolf figure, along with glow in the dark claws</li><li>lots of dark brown pieces</li><li>5 new olive green branches</li><li>price per piece count is quite good.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>only 1 play feature (the catapult action on the tree)</li><li>wasteful parts construction on the tree</li><li>uninspiring designs</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>While there isn't much to say for this set as a set itself, the parts makeup is actually quite good, and you get some nice minifigure accessories too.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-24T10:16:51.827Z","9463 - The Werewolf","<p>The Werewolf was perhaps the set I was least excited for following the release of the first images of the Monster Fighters theme and although it is far from a bad set, I am still left a little underwhelmed by this set overall. The Minifigures are superb, but the model itself leaves something to be desired in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is square in shape and has some action packed artwork. Major Quinton Steele is driving through the haunted forest in search of the Werewolf and his Moonstone, but it looks like the Werewolf has found him first, because the ravenous Werewolf is diving down from his tree to try and stop the Major from stealing his precious stone. The atmospheric green mist is descending and the filthy waters of the swamp being driven through By Major Quinton Steele looks superb with various splashes making the whole design look very realistic. There are a few reeds in the foreground and some twisted trees can be seen in the background along with a full moon and lots of bats which, as always on these boxes, are amassing to provide a dark background for the Monster Fighters logo. In the bottom right corner the Werewolf is displayed along with his orange Moonstone.</p><p>The back of the box shows the features of the set and the glow in the dark claws. There is a small comic like on all of the other boxes showing Lord Vampyre adding this Moonstone to his machine while the Werewolf watches on.</p><p>The instructions have the same artwork as the box cover, I found no mistakes in the booklet and my set had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are in fact a great deal of useful parts in this set, including lots of brown parts (in various shades) and some tan as well. We get five small leaves in olive green which are brand new in this colour and a couple of dark green larger leaves as well which are nice. On the car a nice dark silver frog is used as a mascot which is quite a rare piece, as is the golden fez which forms the tip of Major Steele's blunderbuss.&nbsp;</p><p>The white pith hat worn by the Major is great, but the three glow in the dark claws (you get an extra one) and the head piece for the Werewolf are even better than that! The orange printed Moonstone is excellent as well with some printing of a howling wolf.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The two Minifigures included in this set are both wonderful, I will begin with the heroic Monster Fighter.</p><p>The one Monster Fighter included in this set is <b>Major Quinton Steele</b>, he appears in one other set, 9466, The Crazy Scientist and his Monster, and this figure is identical to that one. He wears a white pith helmet, worn by many explorers and soldiers in the nineteenth century, which has a stud on top for attaching whatever you wish. His face is printed with a unique mechanical monocle and a moustache with side burns. His hair is mostly grey and there are a few wrinkles around his eyes. He has a&nbsp;sombre&nbsp;expression and a small amount of printing on the back of a few wrinkles just above his neck.</p><p>His torso is mainly dark tan but is printed with a brown bandoleer filled with silver bullets to defeat the Werewolf once and for all. He wears a jacket with various pockets and an open collar showing his white shirt beneath. Clasped beneath the strap across &nbsp;his chest is a map and on the back of his torso the bandoleer is continued. His arms are dark tan like his torso and his hands are yellow. His legs and hips are both printed, he has a brown belt on the hips with a silver buckle. On his legs are a pouch fixed on to his thigh, and two teeth hanging from a ring on his belt, perhaps from a previous encounter with the dangerous Werewolf. He wears dark tan trousers just like his jacket so the legs are cast in dark tan accordingly. He carries a brown and gold blunderbuss with a scope and it looks superb, suiting this Minifigure very well indeed.</p><p><b>The Werewolf</b> is an amazing figure, enough to make it one of my favourite Monsters from this theme. The head piece is a supremely detailed mould and has some nice printing too. The shaggy hair of the Werewolf is cast in to this piece and runs part of the way down the back of the torso. He has two large ears and his eyes are printed in black and white. His nose is black and his bared teeth are also white. Most of the head piece is brown, however there are a couple of areas of darker brown printing on the fur going down his back. I much prefer this piece being used to the design used for the Werewolf from Series 4 of the Collectable Minifigures.</p><p>His torso is highly detailed also with a torn chequered shirt with red braces. The shirt is ripped to such an extent that a great deal of his brown fur can be seen on the torso and is printed with some texture. The shirt if actually very similar to that of the Lumberjack from Series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures, allowing you to create his hideous transformation from a standard Minifigure, to a ghastly Werewolf! The back also has the torn red shirt printed on it and braces. His arms are bare so are brown, as are his hands. He has two glow in the dark claws which are the same as those used for the Wolverine Minifigure in the Super Heroes theme, but those were metallic grey. These look excellent when it is light and even better when it is dark as they look very creepy when glowing.</p><p>The Werewolf wears blue trousers which are badly torn to reveal some more brown fur and the belt worn by the human who became this Monster is still intact on his hips. He carries no accessories as his hands are of course used to hold his glow in the dark claws.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not particularly interesting, it takes about thirty minutes and in that time no techniques are used which we have not seen before. The mechanism to launch the Werewolf is quite cleverly made and this build could provide some inspiration for constructing your own trees but beyond that there is little worthy of not here in my opinion. However, the build's simplicity makes it ideal for younger children as it is quite an easy to construct this model, this could increase the appeal of the set to that age group.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The set itself is made up of two main parts, Major Quinton Steele's car, and the Werewolf's tree. The car is mostly tan with four headlights and an engine grille at the front, with the silver frog acting as an ornament for the vehicle. Revolvers act as &nbsp;for the engine and a small windscreen protects the driver. A steering wheel is in the car and there is space to seat a single Minifigure to control the steering wheel. There are clips on either side which can be used to store the blunderbuss and one other item. The rear wheels are much larger than the front wheels making the car appear a bit bizarre but nevertheless attractive. At the very back are some more grilles and some lights.</p><p>The tree is a bit of a mess I think. It looks quite spooky and&nbsp;decrepit&nbsp;as I am sure was the intention of the designers, but it looks a little unfinished. It makes use of a few masonry bricks to support the altar in the shadow the tree where the orange Moonstone is kept. On either side of this platform are bones and teeth, and behind is a translucent orange area, which looks almost like amber within the tree. At the top of the tree is the main feature of the set, a red button can be seen at the back of the shrub which allows you to fling the Werewolf at any&nbsp;unsuspecting&nbsp;travellers near the tree. It causes a small section to explode open which lets the Werewolf be flung without it being hindered by the branches at all. Some dark green weeds complete the look which hang from the leaves. This item certainly does look old and withered, but it seems little thought has gone in to this design as it really does look chaotic from all angles. This is what really pulls this set down in my opinion.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a&nbsp;model&nbsp;which I would recommend, mainly to get the fantastic Werewolf Minifigure, but also for the Major's car which is very nice indeed. This is a good parts pack if you want to make some trees, but the tree that we do get is a bit disappointing. However, given the excellence of the Minifigures, the wonderful car, and the very reasonable price, I am going to give this Monster Fighters set...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"Zrath","2012-07-05T18:16:49.407Z","The Tree Of Sorrows","I just built this last night and my eyes still hurt.<br>Let me explain: the tree is made of dark red and brown, and on the instructions, the colors kinda blend together. Pretty soon, you've got brown on brown and it's really hard to tell which part goes where and in which orientation. Even with my special Lego light turned on for maximum visibility, it still took me way too long to build that tree. Aside from the color issue, there's the fact that the tree is built all weird and the play feature is really quite excessively complicated for what it does. I've seen less complex Technic sets.<br>Aside from the nightmarish tree, the set is merely okay.<br>The hot rod is simple and fun.

"Shistavanen_brick","2012-08-18T03:53:34.55Z","Moonstone hunt near the Werewolf's tree (-house?).","Honestly, I kind of looked forward to this set. Mainly for the new werewolf figure but I also thought it would be an overall good set. For Star Wars fans, this is as close to a LEGO version of the race Shistavanen as you're going to get at the moment. That's just a bonus. Apart from that, I think this is 1 of my top 3 among the monsters in this theme. But that alone doesn't make a good set. Then what<i> do</i> you get?<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div>The 2 minifigures are really cool, each in their own way.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Major Quinton Steele</b>.&nbsp;</div><div>He appears to be a big game hunter from the early 20th century. Equipped with a white safari hat (which tends to fall off easily) and a big, a bit oversized rifle.&nbsp;</div><div><b>- Head:</b> Stern looking face with the mandatory moustache of a hunter. He is wearing some kind of ""sight"" or perhaps some kind of prosthesis over his left eye.</div><div><b>- Torso</b>: Khaki-coloured with lots of printing. Ammo, pockets and of course some kind of map. Yes, how else would Mr Steele find his way to the werewolf's hideout?</div><div><b>- Legs</b>: The same colour as the torso. A belt, a small waist bag and a trophy charm chain (could it be werewolf teeth?)</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Werewolf.</b>&nbsp;</div><div>He comes with a detailed wolf-face and his clothes are ripped a tad. It looks really great, in my opinion. Makes me wonder if we are dealing with a lumberjack, judging from the clothing.</div><div><b>- Head.</b> It has a nice new mold. On one hand it looks a bit too big but on the other hand the detailing might have been lost, had it been smaller. There's a nice set of teeth and cool eyes.</div><div><b>- Torso.</b> Yep, the shirt is partially ripped. The red printing fits the figure great and small detailing makes it pretty cool. Its basic colour is brown, which pretty much goes for the entire werewolf.</div><div><b>- Legs</b>. Blue with the occasional rips.</div><div><b>- Claws.</b> He comes with a pair (actually 3) of claws that attach, Wolverine-style, to his hands. Just like any other weapon or tool. They glow in the dark, quite awesome!</div><div><br></div><h4>The Car.</h4><div>Quinton comes in what looks like a steam-punk inspired hot rod of some kind. It makes me wonder how the Monster Fighters theme would co-exist in a LEGO city, with all its modern style? Don't get me wrong, this car is fantastic and very unique in every way. It just seems taken from another time. The build for this one is fun and the car has a great look to it when finished. The colours suits the Major, that's for sure. A part of the engine is made up by several revolvers and you get a silver frog as decoration in the front.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, there are no compartments to store things. Ok, there's a place for his rifle but nothing else. It would have been nice to have some other hunter tools. Perhaps a silver cage to trap the werwolf?</div><div><br></div><h4>The werewolf tree.</h4><div>Can you spell c-o-m-p-l-i-c-a-t-e-d? I thought so, and that is pretty much what this is. A tree that is not a tree, but too complicated to remain a tree. I do not like it at all, and then this being over half the set. Blargh! I can honour the idea that the werewolf would do a jump attack on Mr. Steele but as it is now, the tree doesn't function very well to begin with. I'd much rather have seen an ordinary tree and some catapult function on the side.</div><div><br></div><div>To remain on the positive side, I kind of fancy the moonstone ""shrine"", or whatever. It looks dangerously inviting to an adventurer. The werewolf moonstone is excellent and just as cool as it can be. I can understand if people want to collect them all (monsters or monster fighters). You also get some pretty useful and cool pieces with the set, like the brick-brick in tan brown.</div><div><br></div><h4>Monsterous thoughts.</h4><div>I can't honestly recommend this...not at a retail price. If you find this on sale, then by all means, get your clan of werewolves or steam-punk cars for racing. The set is too weak to rely on the minifigures alone, when the tree is too unsteady or unpractical. It feels a bit too scruffy of a tree, and not in a monster-good way. I'd say you would do better off in buying another monster fighters set instead. At least as your first one. But if werewolves are YOUR thing you will probably buy it anyway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The werewolf IS super-cool. There's no question about it. LEGO did everything right with this main figure of the set. I'd like a couple of them, to be honest. The car is just a fantastic veichle to have, very nicely designed. But that is just not enough in the set to make it worthwhile...not for that price.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Amazing werewolf figure!</li><li>Steam-punk inspired veichle.</li><li>Glow in the dark claws.</li><li>The Monster Fighters theme has possibilities.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Just about almost everything with the tree.</li><li>Moonstone does not glow in the dark.</li><li>An overall feel that ""something"" is missing.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,1,3,1,2,1

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-31T12:10:19.1Z","Howling at the Moon","<p><strong>Set #9463 The Werewolf: </strong>It&rsquo;s the Monster Fighters, a terrifying and thrilling spooktacular Theme that you can&rsquo;t do without if you&rsquo;re a fan of monsters, Halloween or just plain fun LEGO Themes with unique traits. (Such as the Steampunk style vehicles.) This is the largest set I&rsquo;ve gotten around to reviewing yet and I have to say it&rsquo;s a pretty decent build unfortunately the price leaves much to be desired&hellip; Mostly because it&rsquo;s a situation where TRU markup makes a 25$ set 30$ in Canada. Not the best deal, unfortunately the only place with it still in stock these days is TRU.</p>

<p>Anyway let&rsquo;s get on to the review and discuss the good parts and the bad parts of this set.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The design is awesome for this Theme. It&rsquo;s frightening and showcases the sets quite nicely&hellip; well frightening in the sense that its gothic forest background really showcases how much potential a Theme like this has. The images on the front and back showcase this set quite nicely. It&rsquo;s just a great design and if I had enough space I&rsquo;d keep the boxes for this Theme because of it.</p>

<p>The instructions are great, they break up the set&rsquo;s build by the two numbered bags and the steps are easily followed without any tricky or frustrating parts to the builds. The back of the manual has some nice cross-promotional images for this Theme and you&rsquo;ve gotta love the picture which shows off some great artwork with the monsters on one side, the fighters on the other and some of the prominent sets in between in the background of the shot with Lord Vampyre fighting the lead Fighter.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There are a few nice pieces in this set, the glow-in-the-dark claws, the front grille of the Monster Fighter car, the silver LEGO frog which is a nice rare part and the moon stone piece is interesting. Not a lot of rare colours or elements, but still a decent set for some dark forest MOC builds. You&rsquo;re going to find tons of dark brown pieces in this set for the tree, so yeah, dark forest.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The 2 Minifigures in this set are a Monster and a Monster Fighter, which monster you ask? Well the obvious one of course.</p>

<p>The Werewolf: This beastie has a nifty looking double-sided torso print covered in fur with a torn and barely functional shirt, his leg printing has some nifty torn areas with fur revealed underneath.&nbsp; His head piece is brand new and I really hope we see it again someday because you can never go wrong with cool head pieces. Because every Monster Fighter Monster has to have some kind of glow-in the dark feature, the Werewolf gets two claws that glow. It&rsquo;s not a bad gimmick and the pieces might come in handy for some glowing warrior or something, they are a bit odd though because they stand out against the brown and blue colouring of the Werewolf.</p>

<p>Major Quinton Steele: An older character the Major here is a fun looking minifigure, his double-sided torso print includes an ammo belt and a map tucked behind that belt, perhaps a map to the moon stone. His legs include printing for a belt, a pouch of some type and a pair of teeth that&hellip; perhaps once belonged to this Werewolf&rsquo;s daddy (or mother) that he perhaps killed in the past during his younger days. So much character to this print.</p>

<p>He includes the pith helmet head gear and a familiar looking weapon, the Dino Tracker gun in brown, a gold telescope attached to the clip of this gun for a sight and a gold flower pot or fez or whatever it is to make the weapon look like a blunderbuss. Typical steampunk design elements.</p>

<p>Great minifigures in this set.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag #1 will have you building the Monster Fighter car, it&rsquo;s a fast little build with not as many parts as the second bag and has a sweet design for a vehicle from this type of Theme. My only complaint would be the size, since there are so few pieces in it, it does come off as a tad on the small side and so there is a slightly inconsistent number of pieces between the two bags, making you feel like you aren&rsquo;t getting your money&rsquo;s worth as you start building.</p>

<p>Bag #2 is where you get your piece count&rsquo;s worth of a build, it&rsquo;s a bit longer to build and more involved though still there are no real tricky areas. The tree as you build it looks like some kind of movie prop, due to the nature of the gimmicks in this set, still it&rsquo;s a decent tree build with some suitably atmospheric design cues. It wouldn&rsquo;t look out of place next to the Vampyre Castle or Haunted House.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The vehicle is a tad too small in my opinion. It works, but as a completed model it just looks like it&rsquo;s missing something. The windshield is tiny, the engine is awesomely designed and the silver frog piece makes a great decoration, I just can&rsquo;t help feel that it could stand to be a bit bigger.</p>

<p>The tree is a bit of a floppy mess once you reach the top, the base and trunk look ghastly with a small bone filled shrine to hold the werewolf moon stone, and glowing orange bricks inside the trunk as though it were magically about to come alive. Unfortunately once you reach the top of the tree you&rsquo;re stuck with a faulty gimmick, it&rsquo;s a minifigure catapult to launch the Werewolf at anyone foolish enough to try and steal his moon stone.</p>

<p>This means you can see gaps in the bricks at the top of the tree because the technic pieces used to make the launcher are preventing the two sides designed to hide the werewolf from sight of anyone approaching from keeping things flush. The fact that this tree is meant to be a living growing thing with obviously artificially added minifigure launcher bits detracts from the overall design of it. All it does is make me wonder what this thing could have been if they hadn&rsquo;t used such a disappointing play feature for the gimmick, a dark and twisted looking tree with a fiery heart and a moon stone shrine would have looked ten times better if the launcher had been a separate build instead.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>My conclusion regarding this set is that it&rsquo;s a pretty sweet set for its original price. However for the TRU markup it&rsquo;s a bit of a disappointment. Still I&rsquo;d recommend it because it includes some great minifigures and while the builds are flawed, they are a good aside to join the Monster Fighters display and make a great companion piece to the Vampyre Castle.</p>

The tree you build is pretty cool, plus it has an area where you can shoot off the werewolf into Major Quinton Steele. Steele's car is cool, but it's as stale as Major Quinton Steele to be honest. The werewolf and his tree, including an orange moonstone, is the best part of the set. I'm not sure if they sell it still, but it's worth about twenty bucks at your local Walmart or Target.

<p>Building the model was a Solid experience, some small hassles on the tree however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quinton Steele has some great Torso and Leg Prints, as well as a Solid Face. Also has a Nice Weapon.</p>

<p>The Werewolf has an Incredible Molded Head with some decent Torso and Leg print aswell.</p>

<p>For the Models we have Quinton Steele&#39;s Car and the Tree.</p>

<p>The car is a nice looking thing with some lights, silver frog and a grill, And has a place to hold his Weapon. Adds a lot of play value too having a decently sized Hero Veichle.</p>

<p>The Werewolf tree has this very spooky look with some Seaweed parts sitting on the leaves and the Moonstone with some Bones and Spikes covered around it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the main thing here is the play feature where by pushing down a Red Modified plate with a Hole, The werewolf goes flying and can attack Quinton Steele. This is a great play feature that can make for a lot of fun.</p>
