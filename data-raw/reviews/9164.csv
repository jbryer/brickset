<p class=""MsoNormal"">This caught my eye when Monster Fighters was announced,
mostly because of the glow-in-the-dark pieces which I'm keen on, and the three
cute ghosts. I was in my Dark Age when ghosts first came out. These new ones
have a properly ghoulish face rather than those smiling <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=gen012"">ghosts of the 1990s</a>&nbsp;and
the subtle detailing makes for more personality&nbsp;overall. They look
especially funny when you put two together as though they're having a
conversation about something rather shocking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Also in glow-in-the-dark colour are twelve 1x1 cones and
three lightsaber rods; these are unique to this set (although have been available in the past in old glow-in-the-dark colours) and are very useful pieces. There's a 4x4 radar dish with a jack o'
lantern face which I suppose will be fun for Hallowe'en MOCs, plus a large
flamey thing which is marbled trans-light green / glow in dark.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The other exciting thing is that this is a NEW
glow-in-the-dark colour and an improvement over the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?v=1&amp;pg=1&amp;colorPart=46&amp;catType=P"">old glow-in-the-dark opaque</a>.&nbsp;In daylight the pieces have a nice shiny lustre with a slightly more
grayish green tinge. Much better than the greeny-yellow milky version of old. By night, they are brighter than the old opaque&nbsp;(unless it’s just that old ones fade with age?) but a bit less
bright than the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?v=1&amp;pg=1&amp;colorPart=118&amp;catType=P"">old trans-glow-in-the-dark</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>

There are two here.</li><li>Also new in dark red is the 3x4 wedge brick, if you find
that of any use!</li><li>Perhaps more useful are the left and right 12x3 wedge
plates, again new in dark red.</li><li>Black slippers (45 degree 2x1 slopes with 2/3 cutout) are
new this year and the twelve here are the highest number you’ll find in a set
to date. Very useful.</li><li>Black Technic pulley wheels have not been seen since 2005;
again there are twelve.</li><li>The train wheels with counterweights, seen only in Emerald
Night so far.</li><li>Two Gold Fez hats! Used to great effect by adding a gold
cone on top. Otherwise only&nbsp;available in The Werewolf.</li><li>The crossbow and harpoons are in flat silver; as yet only
available in this set and The Mummy.</li><li>There are nine pistols! Overkill? ;o) No, they’re used in an

<h4>The build</h4><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The build starts with the dark red/blay plane which is
quite cute. The body has a good shape and some nice detailing. The wings feel a
tad basic and the chunky flick-fire missiles rather heavy-handed.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Then to the
train engine which was my favourite part of the build, especially the central
cylinder. You know those ugly Technic pin holes on the edges of 4x4 round
bricks? Great to see them put to use here.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Next up are the two small carriages
with bat wings. Based on the box pictures these wings were my least favourite
part of the set, but I was thrilled to discover they actually flap as you move
the train along! In a duckie-pull-along kinda way. Hilarious.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The final
carriage has more Gothic personality to it than the rest of the set. It’s a
cage and the inwardly curved barred gates, made of Droid arms and bones, are slightly
Gaudi-esque. I wouldn’t like to be locked up in it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are repetitive moments, mostly with the ‘ghost
greebling’ of bones, barbs and Droid arms.&nbsp;For me the barbs don’t look
right as I don’t associate spikiness with ghosts, maybe they wanted the haunted train to look more evil. This set is aimed 8-14 and I
think the younger end might find a couple of steps tricky.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>Minifigs</h4><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The two mortal
figs are excellent: both extreme characterisations. The man is really cheesy
and the woman is FIERCE. She has a scar down the middle of her face, wears a
red corset, carries a crossbow and keeps a spare harpoon in her hair. I was disappointed to see that the play images suggest locking HER up in the cage… really can’t imagine her allowing herself to be shoved in
there, whereas HE looks just like the kind of dork who would get caught by
ghosts.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>Summary</h4><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the ‘cool and scarey’ stakes, ghosts don’t really stack
up against werewolves and vampires, and the cuteness of the set doesn't really
help there; so I suspect this Monster Fighters set will appeal more to the
younger age bracket. The train is heavily detailed; maybe girls will
enjoy this more than boys. I like the finished set and having a train and a
plane always makes for good play scenarios. Perhaps a skeleton or two would have added
to the fun. I’m looking forward to the Haunted House as a more appropriate home
for my three ghosts, and perhaps the train will act as their transport there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is a bit too large comparing with what is inside of it.<br>Could be a bit more compact which would make the set more easy to transport.<br>

"Topcop999","2012-10-16T06:49:14.59Z","A personal favourite!","<p>I was very&nbsp;excited&nbsp;to see this in Argos a few months ago and I thought I would decide to review it now. This is easily my&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;Monster Fighter set along with the Vampyre's&nbsp;hearse&nbsp;and I'll get into why I feel that way...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>

"Firox_5000","2012-10-07T18:47:18.84Z","Ghoulish train","<p>This set was the third monster fighters set I bought which was during a 3 for 2 offer at Argos which this set was the item to come free in the purchasing. This set contains 741 pieces [most of which are small bones,spikes etc;/ which took me just over an hour to build and construct. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The set includes five minifigures Frank Rock, Ann Lee, and three ghost figures. The ghosts are a great welcomed return as they haven't been made in lego for years. The ones in this set are certainly an improovement from the old ones as their masks are more sleek and conceals more of the figure body and also glows in the dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other figures in this set are the good guys Ann Lee and Frank Rock. Ann Lee is neatly designed figure with a double sided torso and some clever leg printing of material for weapons and equipment. Anne lee's hairpiece is very&nbsp;detailed and pointed and although resembles that of the cave woman's is a&nbsp;great hair piece. The figure also has&nbsp;a spare arrow in her hair and comes with a bow and another arrow. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Frank Rock&nbsp;is clearly the weakest figure&nbsp;and is perhaps the least inspiring figure overall in the whole monster fighter series as his hair piece is clearly&nbsp;too similar to the&nbsp;minifigure series and his torso although double sided&nbsp;is not so nicely printed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other than the figures, the set includes to main objects. The hero's fighter place and the ghost train itself. The hero fighter plane which is the first object to be finished in the building. The completed model has a rather simple and classic look to it and is also surprisingly larger than&nbsp;it seems. The plane has a&nbsp;one piece propeller at the front and also&nbsp;has gun pieces made to resemble the engines at the side of it. The plane also comes with a ghost sucktion guns and the storage area itself which is made of two barrel pieces. While it clearly doesn't actually have a playability function is a nice deal to the plane. There are also flick fire missles included which although&nbsp;increase playability&nbsp;can be awkward&nbsp;to fire well. The plane overall is a very nicely designed model. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second and main object of the set is the ghost train itself which comes with three carriages and the train itself. The main locomotive is nicely detailed with a neat scary face at the front of the model with a toxic green flame from on top as well as spiked curved pieces at the side which add greatly to the menacing look of the locomotive. The inside of this unit also has a neat feature of a small fire in the engine room which adds to the playability and slight realisticness of the train model. There is also the rather cool ghost moonstone on the top of the train too. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't really same the same for the rest of the train as it seems rather lack luster in the inbetween carriages are exacly the same and seem a bit basic, plain and resemblent of ninjago sets when the skelentons where around. The only good thing of these areas other than holding the ghost figures are the cool geared feature of the wings going up and down when the trains being pushed on the floor. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final carriage which is the prison carriage is slightly better as the bones add an effect here as being containers of the prisoner and make it look rather creepy however the problem of getting the figure in and out easily loses it's greantess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the set is not the worst one out there definately not the best either as parts of this set seem to resemble phase one models of ninjago which is a theme I am not particulay fond of but the playability, classic plane and the fact so much of the model shines beautifally in the dark make up for this as many parts of the train including the front, ghosts and spikes all glow which to my knowledge is the highest number of illuminous parts in one set which does drive up some marks. But seeing the fact other than the ghosts the set contains no stand out figures, repeated structures and the high asking price of £60 which this set should be £50 at the max , it's a set that is very mixed in greatness and disapointment. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall I would recommend this set if you like monsters, ghosts trains glow in the dark pieces, playability, classic planes &nbsp;and those collecting Monster Fighter sets. Other than that, I would only recommend buying this set if you find it reduced or in an offer e.g 3 for 2. If you want to buy monster fighter sets, save your money for the mummy and swamp sets as they include the main heroes that appear in this set. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"beegeedee","2013-06-13T07:20:22.553Z","Spooktastbrick set.","<p>Ghost Train is the third largest set in the Monster Fighters theme featuring an airplane for the heroes and a train with 3 carriages for the ghosts. I say heroes but I have to say these so-called heroes look thuggish and in a battle you'd want the ghost to win...</p><p>For those from Europe, in Ireland at least the price in the local toy store is 71.99 Euro.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a rather large affair which is what you would expect for a set with 740ish pieces but on opening you soon realise the parts occupy about 1/2 of the box. I understand that a smaller box at this price it may look like it's not value for money.</p><p>The instructions are in the form of 2 smallish books and was pleasantly surprised to find they were bagged and reinforced with cardboard. Book one covers the airplane and the train engine while book 2 covers the 3 carriages for the train.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Parts are spread across 6 bags with 2 hoses loose in the bottom of the box. while the part count is high you realise quickly there's lots of small parts like the white horns and skeleton arms which together is about 50 pcs.</p><p>Other parts of note are:</p><ul><li>The bones. I like bone pieces and can there can never be enough of these IMO</li><li>The glow-in-the-dark 1x1 cones</li><li>The glow-in-the-dark 4x4 dish with halloween-type face on it.</li><li>The glow-in-the-dark flame piece<br></li><li>The wings - 2 sets</li><li>The black train wheels for the main train</li><li>The 12 black pulley wheels</li><li>2 reddish brown tubs</li><li>10 fin pieces</li><li>The black cow pusher</li><li>A chain - the part supplied seemed poor quality however and had little bits of extra plastic all over it. It's a little disappointing.<br></li></ul><p>Also, lots of 2x2 black bow pieces which are handy to have.</p><p>Spare pieces number 33 which include 2 train wheels (they come in 2 packs of 3 and only 2 are used from each pack) and the usual 1x1 round plates, skeleton arms, white horns etc.</p><p>Finally a modern orange brick separator is included which is always welcome and handy.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are 5 minifgures. the 2 heroes are well printed and their faces are both double-sided. these are the same 2 heroes as in the mummy and swamp creature sets so if it's just those you want then the small sets are a better purchase.</p><p>My personal favourites so far are the 3 ghosts. Nothing more exciting except they are nicely done, white bodies, black head and the hood over the top. They really really glow after a little light to charge them up.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Bags 1 and 2 along with the 2 loose hoses build the airplane which is actually quite large. Equipped with flick missiles and what, I assume, is a ghost vacuum to attack the ghosts is a nice build.</p><p>Bags 3 and 4 are for the train. 3 contains the majority of the cabin and the front part of the train which is finished off by bag 4 which has the tank, funnel and creepy vine-like constructions along the side made from black fins and the white horns...nice touch</p><p>Bag 5 makes the 2 carriages featuring bat wings. A nice little technique is used for getting the wings to move but it would have been nice to vary them rather than use exactly the same design for both.</p><p>Bag 6 builds the prison carriage and is actually quite fiddly with all those skeleton arms for the doors. The end result is really effective and definitely looks a little creepy.</p><p>Overall it takes just over an hour to put together and there's lots of intricate parts (like the doors) which take more time in general.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Together the model looks good. Dark, glow-y in places and quite satisfying. As an actual train it's a little disappointing. The use of rubber with pulley wheels on the carriage means a lot of thought to motorising would be needed. On the plus side for a kid without other trains it can be pulled along the floor wings all flappy and it looks good.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A good set but with a bit more work could have been great. 3 different carriages would have been nice, even if just variations on a theme. A few more glowing parts so the black stood out more or perhaps on the carriage doors so you could see inside in the dark wouldn't go amiss. Or a sound brick with a spooky sound or something. Ah, we always want more.</p><p>Value for money? Well, this is tricky. There's an abundance of small pieces so on the surface the price per piece seems really good but if you consider this then probably the set is a little overpriced. Saying that, the glowing pieces probably cost a little more to make...the short answer is probably a little overpriced - down by 5 GBP/10Euro.</p><p>On sale is a no brainer - I believe I paid around 44 euro/35 pounds for this set.</p><p>Would I recommend the set - absolutely but not at RRP. Get even a small discount and it's totally worth the money.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box really sells the action of the scene - with Frank piloting his plane and Ann hanging down with her crossbow, aiming at the ghosts menacingly floating around their ghost train. Easily one of the coolest looking boxes.</p><p><br></p><p>Instructions are what you expect.</p><p><br></p>

<h4>The build</h4><p>The train is a bit of a repetitive build. &nbsp;Two of the cars are identical and pretty basic and the remaining two have similar enough anatomy to feel like deja-vu. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I was a little underwhelmed by the train. &nbsp;It didn't look like a ghost train to me, especially if there were no ghosts around it. &nbsp;It just looks like a scary train. &nbsp;The rail details on the front, as well as all the bone spikes and wings make it look a little like something from a Ninjago set.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Monster Fighters theme is easily one of my favorite Lego® themes so far. &nbsp;This set, however, was my last purhcase. &nbsp;If you're looking in a similar price range, I would recommend buying the Vampyre Castle over this. &nbsp;Cooler minifigures, much more attractive set, and one of the coolest vehicles I've seen made by Lego. &nbsp;Equally as cool is the Crazy Scientist and His Monster, which uses light-up bricks. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Ghost Train was my least favorite of this theme.</p>",TRUE,2,4,1,4,3

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is good, instructions clear, protected.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many usable parts, but a lot of black.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Even though minifigures&nbsp;are not at all the focus of the set, the three gloomy ghosts are fantastic to have. Ann Lee is well detailed, as is Frank Rock and really one can&#39;t complain too much about the figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was actually really fun, until I got to the repetitive two cars. Lego was being a little lazy here and could&#39;ve given the train at least one differently built car. That is one negative about the set. The plane build was very fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is fantastic, a child could play with it for hours and an adult could display it on a desk or shelf and it would look visually stunning. Flapping wings when the train moves gives the set a fun vibe and the wings&nbsp;imitate the sounds of bones clanking against one another. There is a little prison cell designed for Frank, Ann, or any of the ghosts to be placed within. The plane provides one with flick fire missiles, which gives the set even more playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

This could be due to nostalgia, because this was awesome as a kid, but it still looks amazing.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a good set in my opinion. I would recommend it.</p>
