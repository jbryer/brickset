"tatuvlakia","2012-08-31T15:42:29.863Z","Lego´s best halo to date is also huge in size!","Only thing missing to make it this year´s flagship model is power functions.<div><br></div><div>It seems as if the model got motor-less at the last moment for marketing reasons, being as it is prepared and designed to take an m-motor and batteries perfectly integrated.</div><div><br></div><div>Loads of parts, and nice to see the gearbox and most of the mechanics for it´s functions still leave room to have interior space just like a real copter would. Most of the parts are red or yellow, with a good selection of gears and gearbox pieces as well as the exclusive (so far) new blade pieces with rubberized tips, which arc down under their own weight beautifully on the main rotor just like a real blade would.</div><div><br></div><div>The build is very satisfying, particularly so for those of us who enjoy and savor every step, and not rush to have it complete. You start from the front and work your assembly towards the aft section and up, avoiding the typical studless ""inside-out"" type of construction which makes you assemble pieces without having any clue where they belong in the model. Stickers are nicely done and labeled with numbers, and I think they do add to the model although I hate applying stickers to my parts!</div><div><br></div><div>Functions seem designed to be actuated by a motor, since the gearing is quite low, but are nevertheless nicely activated by a medium gear on the side. The rotors have a ratchet mechanism that lets you spin them without forcing the gears. The only not perfect function is the winch, which is way too hard to actuate, but nothing that could not be solved by swapping a blue pin for a tan-gray one. I imagine this would generate too much wear and friction if motorized like this!</div><div><br></div><div>The Helicopter is very sturdy and can easely be picked up although the side sliding doors do open and close randomly due to them not having any locks.</div><div><br></div><div>Value for money is harder to judge, bought for 120 euro. It does have a very imposing size though, so could seem like a better value if you compare sizes to other comparable models (in piece count).</div><div><br></div><div>I am very satisfied with having bought this set, and think that will be a future classic. Being a helicopter lover, I think it achieves the look of a NHI 90 helicopter very nicely!</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,3
"Akeyzerr","2012-09-04T18:54:21.64Z","Technic set of the year!","<p>I just finished the build, delaying opening the box for almost a week not sure if I'd keep it or gift it away. That said aside I'm totally in love with this one. The parts(WOW for the rotor blades), the detail, the build, the functions - all I love about the Technic theme - is top notch. I bought the model for about $90 and value for the money from where I'm standing is absolutely great! Power functions are great! Actually the lack of PF is even greater! Don't get me wrong - spinning these blades manually is a pain in the fingers 3 minutes into it, BUT having lots of unpacked battery boxes(and motors for that matter) from the sets from last few years, it is great for me not adding another one to the pile; And with that having to pay less for this awesome set and its shipping.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's all that Technic stands for!<br></li><li>Great building experience.</li><li>Beautiful and realistic design and presence.<br></li><li>Lack of included PF is a plus to me.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons(stretching for it)<br></h4>
<ul><li>Some loose play of gears(due to the switch mechanism) when used without PF<br></li><li>Rotor blades mold cast is on the top(more visible) side.<br></li><li>(No flex system)<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>IMHO: In the awe surrounding 9398 - 4x4 Crawler this beauty is not getting the attention it should. Go out and get it, you won't regret it!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Olamisai","2012-09-29T15:32:28.93Z","The (sea) king of all helicopters","<p>Don't skip this one. Whilst not perfect, it's the best technic helicopter to date by far.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Typical new size box for the 100€ technic set. Nice to see the instructions and stickers in plastic, supported by cardboard, with an extra peice of card sandwiching the main rotor blades.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nice selection of technic, and of course the all new blades with authentic 'droop' built in.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Were all very excited, and queued up for a ride once the build was complete. The pilot from my sons 7741 is considering a career change.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Suprisingly long, split over 3 books. You'll start at the front of the helicopter, and slowly make your way to the back back before adding the engines and those oh so loverly rotors. Perhaps a new candidate for the ""set with the fastest adding of a wheel ever"" category with the front part of the undercarridge.</p><p><br></p><p>In places a bit fiddly and it takes a while for everything to come together, the sliding doors are a nice touch. As others have said, the winch is a bit of a letdown.. a little too stiff to operate on my finished build.</p><p><br></p><p>One minor difference, compared with other technic helicopters, some things appear mirrored. The winch is on the opposite side to normal, and you are forced to rotate the blades anti-clockwise.<br></p><p><br></p><p>As you build it's easy to test that everything is working as expected, and for a change, there's no impossible to reverse build steps in case you make a minor mistake.</p><p></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Drool!..&nbsp; Big, for a midrange set, and the colour scheme is perfect with or without stickers. Looks like the real thing from all angles, and has a nice range of functions. <br></p><p><br></p><p>In a way it would be nice to see this in orange, white and black as a counter to 7738 (Coast Guard Helicopter), but for once i'm not complaining about seeing another red and yellow set.</p><p><br></p><p>If using handpower to spin the blades, don't try rotating the handwheel by 360. Use the built in ratchet mechanism and twist anticlockwise-clockwise-anticlockwise etc. to build up some nice momentum in the blades.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Best helicopter to date. Definate playabilty and gawpability.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2013-04-21T22:21:02.197Z","Best Technic Set for 2012","<p>This model is massive, good looking, and loaded with functions. Beyond doubt it is the greatest helicopter model produced by TLG so far. I can't say I am a fan of the color scheme, but it's not too bad. Adding the PF upgrade to the model is practically a must for any playability since the crank simply does not work well.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Authoritative look with unmistakable rescue helicopter shape and design elements<br></li><li>Excellent selection of functions for the young pilot<br></li><li>New blade elements look nice</li><li>Smooth operation of the winch and landing gear</li><li>Works very well with power functions</li><li>Good build and clear instructions<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Color scheme could be better<br></li><li>The loading bay ramp and the collective are somewhat clunky and not well balanced. Also there is no cyclic control on the rotor.<br></li><li>Has to be motorized for playing</li><li>The main rotor rotates at very low rpm (too unrealistic), bit it is probably intentional&nbsp; safety feature of the design</li><li>Lack of cyclic control (admittedly, this is hard to implement faithfully with LEGO)<br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, this is definitely the best Technic set for 2012 that steals the show from the 4x4 crawler (9398) which suffers from a less than inspired design. The heli is not perfect by all measures, but worth checking out.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Techman","2013-11-30T09:02:52.047Z","The Best Underrated Technic Model in 2012","Before I begin my review, let me just say that this ""technic"" set is one of the better models out there to buy! The helicopter is loaded with functions and the size is enormous. When I first got the box I was surprised that Lego has reduced the size to cut back on costs? Still, this didn't take away from how full the box was. There were around 9 bags with some smaller bags filled with pins inside the larger bags! Keep in mind the bags aren't numbered, so I decided to sort the pieces out, that's just me though. There are 3 instruction booklets and I will say that they made the building a bit to easy, honestly. For example, they had one page devoted to placing just a single brick into the model. What! Seems a bit strange, but I still enjoyed the build as it took me around 4 hours to assemble. The overall model is quite complex and nicely designed.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>With only 1056 pieces, this model packs a punch. It is mostly hollow on the inside, except for all the inner mechanics of the landing gear and pitch for the rotors. One thing that disappointed me was that Lego didn't include any PF accessories! I think the model was supposed to have them, but Lego took it out for cost reasons. Anyhow, the instructions do show you how to add your own motor to make the set even better! I would definitely suggest you make the investment to further enhance the models play-ability. &nbsp;:)</div><div><br></div><div>Well, how to summarize this model, It's Awesome! With all the useful pieces and new rotor blades, this set is a definite must have to any avid Lego ""technic"" fan! There are plenty of liftarms/beams and gears to add to your parts collection. This is probably my NEW favorite ""technic"" model for the 2012 line up. It even beats the notable 9398 4x4! I think the helicopter is stealing the spotlight folks. Even if the sets price is a bit high for $119.99, this set is most worth it for the looks, size, and playable functions, which are many! So go and buy this set before it's too late, you won't be disappointed!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,3
