The little car fit perfectly in the belly of the chopper. It has retractable wheels for landing that you can manually extract. Good pieces if you're after orange and white.<br><br>The only BIG problem is the main propeller. It's heavy and it is attached lousy, it wobble badly. It's a pity becouse it was not hard to make a better joint.<br>",TRUE,3,4,5,3,4
"Thelone","2013-01-10T20:33:09.737Z","A pretty interesting (and apparently obscure) set","First thing first : I got this set at a clearance sales for 20â‚¬ (2/3 the asking price here) so maybe this review will be a little biased because of that, but I'll try not to.<br><br>Anyway, this is quite an advanced build for that price. No crazy techniques or anything like that, but you'll easily waste an hour of your time building this beast. And yes, this is also quite a large aircraft, I was actually surprised by its size when the set was finished.<br><br>The helicopter has storage space on the back for a little red car to park there, three retractable wheels for landing and the propeller/rotor thing isn't that bad and doesn't look fragile.<br><br>The only problem I have with this set is that it could have been minifig scale (the cockpit anyway) with little to no effort. I'm sure a competent modder can probably fix that pretty easily, but I don't get why TLC didn't think of that. Oh well !<br><br>In conclusion, if you can still find this set somewhere, go for it, you won't regret it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
