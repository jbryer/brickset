"Kalhiki","2012-08-11T09:48:16.35Z","A triumphant return","<p>Nex is easily my favorite Hero. I just love the medic type characters. So far,&nbsp;Nex has appeared twice before, so how does&nbsp;this&nbsp;version of Orange Julius&nbsp;stack up to his previous incarnations?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The bag has the CGI picture of him and the set information on the front. The back shows the set's features. Nothing spectacular going as all the bags pretty much feature the same thing. However, along with his wave-mates, the bag does come with a golden top, which makes it easily distiguishable from the silver tops of last wave.</p>
<p>The instructions are easy to follow, and also show the combi model in the back. Not much to go over. (I still wonder why I go over this section so much since you obviously want to know what the set itself is like).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Nex doesn't come with too many interesting parts, I must say. The helmet, however, is worth going over. Much like Evo, Nex's helmet is modeled off of his 2.0 helmet. It has tons of similar looks compared to it and some added detail like the circuitry in the top of his head. However, I feel they made it too similar. The cool thing about Evo's was that it was obviously based on the 2.0 helm what with the cheek vents, but it had enough differences to set it apart. Nex's however, does not and just doesn't seem as creative.</p>
<p>He also&nbsp;has an orange lower gun half, and of course the new torso in white. This time it features orange circuit board-like printing, which looks good for a tech-based character.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is it. He does come with the slim torso and&nbsp;some&nbsp;system pieces like a minifig harpoon,&nbsp;a bullhorn, and a&nbsp;trans green antenna. But otherwise, nothing too interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>They need to make a new build. This one's fizzling out. Maybe make some new pieces or features to make the build more interesting. Nex has a generic build for a Hero and the attachment of the system pieces isn't enough to add flavor. Other sets had something going for them in terms of creativity. But Nex? Nothing.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model, however, is great. But the lack of an interesting build doesn't give him anything very interesting. Still, I think he looks good. The overall design&nbsp;is quite appealing and the lighter colors seem to&nbsp;invoke a medic type character. Not to mention the cool usage of the minifig harpoon as an antenna. Some may complain about the white torso, but I think it looks good, and having it orange would just&nbsp;give him too much of said color.&nbsp;The laser cutter is also decent, but if you're one to role-play, since it's connected by a single stud, it will pop off if you hit it too hard. Not to mention the length being a tad bothersome.</p>
<p>As usual, problems. While easily fixable, he doesn't come with back armor. But, like I said, it's easy to fix if you have a spare foot or something else to cover the gap. His helmet comes across as a problem as well. No, not the design, but the size. It just seems big. Not too terribly big, but the shape makes a strange illusion that makes it seem bigger than it is. Especially the chin piece which goes below the actual head and makes it look kinda goofy. But it mainly just takes some getting used to. My main problem though is the hand situation. He has a hand piece, yes, but it's holding his gun. Therefore, it's not free to use. Secondly, it's black, which clashes with his white and orange color scheme. I&nbsp;would have liked it&nbsp;if his laser cutter was wrist mounted and he had a hand on that side instead.</p>
<p>One final comment, I like the parallel between him and Evo. Evo has a heavily armored gunmetal arm of his right, and&nbsp;Nex has a similar heavily-armored arm on his left. Whether intentional or not, it is cool that they still have something that makes them seem related.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, Nex is good, but not the best.&nbsp;The building experience leaves something to be desired. And the completed model is not without problems. The main issue being his hand. I'd have to rate him somewhere between a four and a five. Compared to his other incarnations, his 2.0 is better, but he comes in a close, close&nbsp;second.&nbsp;He's a good figure, but there are&nbsp;other sets in the wave&nbsp;that are just much nicer and more interesting than him. If you like him, get him, otherwise, wait a bit.</p>
<p>(Personally, I like him a lot, but this is my bias, since he's my favorite character.)</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"Zatth","2013-04-22T16:16:51.487Z","Julius Nex Leaps Into Action!","<p>This version of Nex is one of the smaller heroes from the Hero Factory: Breakout Wave 2. At under 10 dollars, he is a great choice if you have a lower budget, but are looking to add a Breakout hero to your collection. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Playability - as with all the Breakout sets, Nex has a great range of motion, and two neat play features: his plasma shooter, and his special handcuffs.<br></li><li>The Plasma Shooter: This is the fancy storyline name for his sphere shooter. As far as launchers go, this is a great design: not only does it look great, but it is very accurate and powerful! (don't aim it at anyone's face - it can hurt!)<br></li><li>The Hero Cuffs: These are also an excellent addition - they greatly enhance his play value if you have a villain to fight him.&nbsp;</li><li>The color scheme and pieces: Nex's selection of orange and white looks great. The colors contrast well and are rather rare (especially that orange!). Nex also has some fine pieces: His helmet looks great, and the use of a harpoon for his antenna helps to complement his overall look. He also has a cool multi-colored rubber tube, and a lime green antenna.<br></li><li>Points for the online game: Nex's hero core piece has a special code on the back - it can be redeemed in the online breakout game on the Hero factory website for 200 game points. If you like the game, the points are a great aid, and will greatly help you purchase in-game upgrades!<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The Laser Cutter: This is not a bad weapon - it complements the rest of Nex nicely, and fits with his general repair/techie theme. The problem with it is that it's movement is limited. It's hard to pose and takes up room.<br></li></ul>
<p>Because Nex was not especially popular when he first came out, there is a bit of a surplus of him in stores - he is still available from the LEGO Shop website as of this writing. I picked him up on clearance in a local store - he had been marked down to only 6.27 USD. <br></p><p>Although he is a bit small compared to the other heroes of his line, Nex is still a worthy purchase. He is both inexpensive and very playable, and has a nice selection of pieces.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Curt1234","2020-06-24T22:19:56.667Z","Nice set.","<p>I recently was bought this set by my parents and it is smaller than I remember, but that&#39;s OK. Let&#39;s list the pros and cons of buying this set.<br />
<br />
Pros to buying this set:</p>

<p>&mdash; The parts and building experience are phenomenal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The parts are very good for a set my parents bought for around 7.00-8.00 USD. Many of the parts, like the laser, are non-descriptive and can be used to make mocs with almost no struggle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons to buying this set: &nbsp;<br />
&mdash; Lacklustre playability.</p>

<p>The playability suffers due to how easily parts (Such as the laser) break away from the main character. Posability is at a minimum&nbsp;due to the big armour piece being on the hand, which makes any pose where the lower arm piece is showing rather ugly. The antenna piece on his right&nbsp;shoulder often makes posing his left shoulder difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash; No coverage from the backside.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I mean is: Hero Factory from Breakout typically have coverage on the back, usually using a foot. Unlike&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6282-1/STRINGER"">Stringer</a>, Nex does not have the excuse of having a transparent body armour piece, which, if a foot was added, would hinder the effect of having a transparent piece.</p>

<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Cuff placement could&#39;ve been chosen a bit better.<br />
<br />
If you followed the instructions exactly, like I did, You know that the Hero Cuffs are located on the left leg of Nex. This hinders posability of the entire left arm, if you wanted to place it downward, like I did when I build the set. You, if you prefer posability, could place the cuff-holder and cuffs in the left pinhole of the body armour piece.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I like this set despite it&#39;s flaws. It&#39;s a nice edition to any Hero Factory collection. Definitely would not pass this set up. It does seem that I ragged on this set pretty hard, but that&#39;s just the tough love attitude I have with Lego.</p>
