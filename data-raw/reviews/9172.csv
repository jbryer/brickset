"Kalhiki","2012-08-05T10:11:05.17Z","Generic build, but awesome set.","<p>Core Hunter. Probably one of the best villain ideas Lego has come up with. I mean,&nbsp;really, he's a serial killer. But does this cool character carry over to a cool&nbsp;set?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Being a medium sized set, he comes in&nbsp;the larger&nbsp;sized bag. You get the nice CGI picture of him jumping (or perhaps flying even though he can't fly) through Makuhero City. You can also see Bulk in the background chasing him down. And of course there's the set information that really doesn't need to be gone over along with the set's features on the back.</p>
<p>Instructions were kinda wrinkled. Only bad part about the bags is that things can get wrinkled. In the back of the instructions there's a picture of the combiner model which actually looks pretty good.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>In terms of new parts, Core Hunter is lacking. The only exclusive part to this set is the helmet. It's a lovely design with the six eyes and vent-like mouth. The other new piece is the ankle guard (first seen in Ultrabuild Captain America). While not entirely new, it is new in color, that being black, and in the Breakout wave 2 line-up. </p>
<p>He does come with some recolors, though. Black Savage Planet ""paws"", a black Multi Tool Ice Shield, and the new torso piece in black. I'm not sure if they've been in this color before, but there are curved red claws that can also be mentioned. Interesting parts include the bandolier,&nbsp;Black Phantom&nbsp;chest piece, and the shortest bone pieces.&nbsp;All these pieces I'm sure will be useful to MoCists.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, Core Hunter has a pretty generic build. It's really no different compared to your average Hero. The only thing that may make it interesting is the construction of the back armor and the claw, but&nbsp;they're so simple that&nbsp;they shouldn't even be included. Other&nbsp;sets had something that made the build somewhat unique. Voltix had the ""on/off switch"" on his back, Furno has the jetpack, etc. But I guess there's really nothing they could have done to Core Hunter to make him more interesting of a build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Despite the not-so thrilling build, Core Hunter is a fantastic looking set. The black and red coloring is superb and makes him look evil. I mean, really. He's like exclusively black and red aside from the weapons which are gunmetal. Speaking of which, they aren't too interesting, but they get the job done. The gun is pretty much standard, and the claw, while simplistic,&nbsp;pulls off a nice appearance.&nbsp;He also has something going for him in terms of proportions. I love the large upper half and somewhat&nbsp;skinny legs. It's a classic design of your average cartoon strong guy, but it's done well enough that&nbsp;it still looks natural. Plus, those spikes on his back and shoulders just look menacing and&nbsp;create such a nice looking figure. I also find it cool that if you want, you could plack Hero Cores (specifically the ones that come with the villain sets) on his bandolier to make it look like he's disabled some&nbsp;Heroes and wants to show off his trophies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for problems, the back construction is a little... eh. It uses that Technic&nbsp;based piece that has two pins on one side, and opposite of that are two balljoints (it was also&nbsp;on&nbsp;Drilldozer, if you're not sure what I'm talking about). Due to this,&nbsp;only one balljoint&nbsp;is&nbsp;used to connect the back armor leaving the other balljoint sticking out. The helmet, while cool, doesn't cover his whole head. I wish it was a tad longer so it&nbsp;would cover his chin and maybe more of the sides of his head.</p>
<p>But my main issue&nbsp;is the arms.&nbsp;The lower arms are tiny. Like really tiny. As in, the smallest bone piece imaginable. The claw arm is&nbsp;fine for the most part. Since the claw parts extend far enough out, the MTIS piece somewhat invokes&nbsp;the appearance of a lower arm. But the gun arm. Rocka's was fine probably because his upper arm was skinnier. But, Core Hunter's is muscular, and for some reason it just doesn't look right. Especially in action shots where his arm just looks ridiculously short when outstretched. Luckily, I'm getting used to the look.&nbsp;But they are rather&nbsp;hard to move them since they're so small.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I think Core Hunter is a worthy purchase. The issues I face are rather minor, and can be easily fixed with some creativity (don't know about the helmet, though). Even though he has a rather generic build, the finished product does not dissapoint. Color layering gives off a menacing and evil&nbsp;vibe suitable for this figure's character. However, the build can be detrimental as there are, in turn, far more interesting figures you could get. If you really like him, get&nbsp;him. But if you were&nbsp;on the fence, maybe get some other figures first. I leave it as a 5/5, making me highly recommend picking&nbsp;Core Hunter up if you're interested.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

"Kuurk9999","2017-02-25T22:17:18.663Z","Heroes BEWARE!!!","<p>Core Hunter has to probably be one of&nbsp;the best villains in the entire Hero Factory series. He&#39;s like a sinister bounty hunter. Here is my review on this set as a whole. i will sum up all pros and cons here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>His helmet is the exclusive part to his set. It looks really cool and resembles Sam Fisher&#39;s goggles from the Splinter Cell series.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>His overall build may be generic, but that&#39;s just what makes this character awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>His core remover tool, while nice, doesn&#39;t look too good with the 4612489: Weapon 4, 2011 parts. I&#39;d rather use different ones to make the tool move, especially with ball joints added in.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&#39;d prefer if the pipe piece wasn&#39;t there on the plasma gun</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>His other arm with the plasma gun could&#39;ve been longer, or heck, maybe use a normal sized&nbsp;CCBS limb and cover it with two shells of armor, and&nbsp;call it a Tank Arm at that.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>overall, Core Hunter is a really good set, he&#39;s fun to play with and you&#39;ll probably enjoy it.</p>
