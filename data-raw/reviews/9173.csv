"toon10001","2012-08-01T08:35:45.857Z","ACTUALLY BULKY THIS TIME!","<p>Bulk is a Breakout/Doom Box hero, and is a vast improvment over bulk 3.0 (He was still awesome, but bulk fixes some of these flaws as he is actually bulky.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bones are nothing special, if you own other hero factory sets then they are pretty much the same. Some long ones, short ones, and the shortest, of which are 3. Armour wise we have&nbsp;3 gunmetal size 5, a body with a print unique to Bulk, some small size 3's in orange and one of those weapon pieces from the 3.0 line. But the best is the 2 5 long orange pieces , only appeared in thornraxx before. Other than that, a few technic pieces, a hero core, a zamor sphere and hero cuffs are all thats included</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different, compared to other sets in the line. the way the rocket launcher&nbsp;and the cuffs are attached are nice, and using the new shoulder armour piece for leg bulkiness is&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Finished model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very good looking, at the least. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is armoured up well, very bulky (as per his name) with shoulder armour (sadly that restricts head movement) and lots of armor. The back is covered with a shoe, which connects the rocket launcher allowing it to be put down when not in use. The cuffs are connected on his torso, instad of on a clip on a arm or leg which&nbsp;makes him even bulkier looking, even quite tough. I wish the ball in the launcher was orange or silver, and the lightsaber blades in the rocket launcher trans read or orange to fit in with his colour scheme (would of worked on voltix, lol)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is very fun to play with, the best hero from the summer wave and the second best overall (Breez still pwns him though.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming next is my review of Stormer XL; Thats all i have at the moment but I will get more and review them so just wait. Hopefully voltix or core hunter, or stringer are next, Nex and Xt4 will be last (if possible) and Speeda will vary.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The figure has no problem to stand stably, better than Breeze.</li><li>Handcuff is arranged in front of the body, it's nicer than being hung on the leg.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Designer focuses on the helmet. It looks different to other models but it makes hard to turn its head.&nbsp;</li><li>There are 2 shields on shoulder which look nice but they are obstacles to head movement.</li><li>The gun base looks OK but it is not easy to turn and seems weak in the connection to the body.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>The model is different to others, somehow nice but it is not flexible for posing. To those who wait for this release, it is a little bit disappointed but still OK for the Hero Factory set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
