<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>as the first four armed CCBS set it&#39;s pretty good</li>
	<li>the colors work well together</li>
	<li>the saw blade is a nice inclusion</li>
	<li>the &quot;sparkers&quot; are well implamented</li>
	<li>this was also the first set with the smaller torso piece</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>one con though is that the laser slicer does not fit with the build at all. too many weapons if you put it like that with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, a good set.&nbsp;He&nbsp;definately does not deserve the hate he got.</p>
