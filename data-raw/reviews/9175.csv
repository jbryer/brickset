<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bone wise nothing new, exepct a new double female, no ball end joint in short size. Very useful piece. Armor we get 4 body pieces, 1 silver 3 white, 6 size 5 armor, 4 are white 2 are blue, 4 size 3 whites, and a huge chestplate&nbsp;in white &nbsp;that requires the balljoints where the arms go to attatch. we get a large torso in black and a regular torso in gry for the first time. We also get a piece that looks like a liftarm with 3 pins but a balljoint in the middle so it can attach armor, bones and such. 6 friction joints from the ultrabuilds/black Phantom, and some new feet, which look lie robo-bird feet. 2 swords with silver&nbsp;and blue, and 5 drone pieces that are meant to represent little robots that come off and attack. Some standard fare hero items (laucher, cuffs, hero core) and soem axels and stuff. Sticker sheet included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legs use all the strenght joints to make him taller and strong, he won't fall over. The chestplate goes over the shoulder joints and stays quite nicely. a second torso from the back will make a design for the arms (same as the one from the ultrabuild hulk) then the sword and gun go on the arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Finished model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is pretty cool, hate the stickers but he works nicely. one thing i would change is on the lower legs i would change the size 5 to a body armor, as it looks awkward like this. </p>
<p>He is very nice looking, attacks well and overall an epic dude. One flaw with the arms is they stick out awkwardly but push them forward from the torso to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recomended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming next, I dont know, bit it will be either Voltix, Core hunter or Stringer. Stay tuned.</p>

"Toa_Daiker","2012-12-27T12:45:08.177Z","Another Hulk","The set is basically the Hulk from the Marvel sets, only much more flawed. LEGO has been trying hard to rescue the big builds from the monotonous and unappealing ""Fire Lord"" builds, but this took it &nbsp;a bit too far. The body is for the most part the best part of the set, thought the support beams under his shoulders aren't the best. Again, he's the Hulk. The arms are suprisingly short and really didn't look like much thought was put into them other than ""He needs arms."". The legs are the worst part. Overall they are just too skinny for such a model and really don't satisfy in appearance. The lower legs are really wierdly constructed. The feet though are pretty neat though. Overall, he's great for parts, but if you want a quality titan, look elsewhere.",FALSE,3,5,4,4,3

"jonathanfrye1999","2015-03-02T19:21:10.75Z","Stormer XL","<p>Welcome to a Jonathan and Jojo&#39;s review of Stormer&nbsp;XL.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has Stormer&nbsp;posing in a icy wasteland with large ice spikes/columns in the background. The instructions were simple, clear and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Mostly reused Ccbs parts, but Stormer also has new feet,&nbsp;a large breastplate and 5 little drone planes. The ball-joint extension pieces are also very useful for MOCing. We also like the new blaster piece and the swords.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Stormer sat on them in the box.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple. The lack of technic pieces utilized in the build was very disappointing, especially for a 25 buck &quot;XL&quot; set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Stormer is a tall and imposing figure. He towers above the Toa and Glatorian of old, and his large chestplate&nbsp;makes the Witch Doctor look scrawny.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Stormer is in general a good set, but the 25 buck price tag and the low piece count keep him out of the &quot;great set&quot; category. Love- Size, armor pieces, gun, sword pieces. Don&#39;t love- cost, low piece count, stubby arms, not much Technic.</p>
