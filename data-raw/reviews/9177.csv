"Kuurk9999","2017-02-27T16:24:35.653Z","Careful Hero, Lightning CAN strike Twice!!!!!","<p>Voltix is an interesting Villain in the Hero Factory lineup, so, I will do a summed up review of him here. Pros and Cons will be summed up in the review here and there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>He has a messy color scheme as he has the many colors of purple, titanium metallic, red, and some bits of blue and yellow to him, but it makes sense because in actuality, Lightning has tints of purple to it just as much as it has yellow, red, and blue.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The arms and pipes are placed in a mess.&nbsp;It goes all the way to his hands and it just looks odd that way. i&#39;d suggest using two of the normal CCBS&nbsp;hands in black instead while having the red hand pieces be attached to 2&nbsp;normal&nbsp;ball joint CCBS&nbsp;arms to attach the pipes onto.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall most people&nbsp;say Voltix is a &quot;meh&quot; set, but in my opinion, i think he&#39;s an interesting set.&nbsp;If you do decide to get him anyway however, you can modify him or do whatever you wish to make him look better.</p>
