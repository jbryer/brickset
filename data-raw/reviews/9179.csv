"Mighty_Wanderer","2012-07-17T17:33:09.067Z","Awesome set, but a little on the expensive side","<p>Like I stated, this set is pretty awesome, but a bit on the expensive side at $80 for 622 pieces. Although, in my opinion the difference is made up by Pythor and the 4 Ninja, this being Pythor's only appearance in Lego and the only set including the 4 main Ninja (excluding Lloyd).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The instructions and sticker sheet came packaged in their own bag with a piece of cardboard to keep them from bending. The box was pretty large, but fit the pieces perfectly, without a lot of sliding room, which was nice.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>Great selection of parts, new and old. My favorite new parts are the 1x1 round plates, they've got a lot of potential.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Starting with Spitta, of the Venomari tribe: He is a pretty cool figure, I really like his torso, but not really his head. I don't think it looks very much like a snake.</p><p>Pythor, of the Anacondai tribe, is a very exclusive figure - appearing only in this set. I think Lego failed with this figure, mainly because his mouth is open, making him really hard to pose.</p><p>The four Ninja, of the human and nin-droid kind: I really like these new ZX Ninja, with their 4-sword backpieces, and great torso printing.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fairly fun build, but there are a couple spots of technic building which gets kind of tedious, and a younger building might need help. (I actually messed up in at a critical point, and it was quite hard to fix it because I didn't realize my mistake until awhile later).<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Fun model, the extending wings is a pretty cool function. I like how when the wings are not extended, the flying part of the vehicle locks on to the bottom part, but when they are extended, it unlocks and you can separate the two.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Great set, try to get in on sale if possible. If not, get it anyway. :-)<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

","I had just turned 16 and had&nbsp;gone through all the presents that were out, and&nbsp;I had no idea mom had one more set in her room! Of course when she had&nbsp;brought it out, I had to believe it was the Ultra Sonic Raider! This was the first set&nbsp;I opened, I was so excited! The Minifigures Zane ZX, Jay ZX, Kai ZX, Cole ZX, Spitta, and Pythor were the perfect ones to put in! The set itself is realy awsome! First it has the seperation function to take the top part off of the bottom! Also the top half comes with a prison cell to put Spitta in. Another function is the flick-fire missiles that are mounted on the treds! I tried realy hard to get the stickers to&nbsp;look perfect and now it looks amazing! Because the instructions were so clear, the build was easy, and I think even younger kids would have fun with this set! Plus as a nice bonus the set comes with two silver and two black Katanas and all four of the Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu with an extra Dragon Sword of Fire!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"A","2013-11-27T10:25:29.33Z","Explanations of what I think of the Ultra Sonic Raider.","Hi. I'm going to start with the pricing, which is perfectly fine. I would actually raise the price to $90! The packaging i'm gonna give a 4 cause it's so BIG! I really think that they could of made the box smaller. Alright the parts. So really think they could of put some more technic lift arms in there to make another special function. Now were on to building experience. Every LEGO set even the hardest one to build, I like to build it. And the small sets, i'm kinda disappointed. Ok playability. So again technic lift arms to make a special function. But the top coming of like a plane, I think that's really cool. The cage i like too. So for the overall rating its a E like on a calculator it doesn't have enough space for more. So I'll say a 27 (adding all the other ratings together). Bye.<div>&nbsp;</div>",FALSE,5,4,5,4,5
"Darthdany","2013-03-30T21:49:52.67Z","One of the best Ninjago sets!","<p>The Ultra Sonic Raider is one of the best Ninjago sets in my opinion. There's a lot of figures, including the exclusive-to-this-set Pythor, and ZX Ninjas, with armor and places to put their katanas on their back. and includes all 4 Golden Weapons, with an extra Nunchuck of Lightning and Sword of Fire. The vehicle itself has a great colour scheme, and the gold daggers make it look more fearsome. The best part of the set (in my opinion) is that the vehicle can separate into 2. The vehicle is pretty large, and the golden swords are too.  Also, like most Ninjago sets this looks pretty much like the actual one in the cartoon series, minus the prison cage.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Includes the exclusive Pythor.</li><li>Very large vehicle can split into 2.</li><li>Has all 4 Golden Weapons, and a place to store them too.</li><li>Awesome colour scheme.</li><li>Golden Swords on jet/plane is humongous.</li><li>When the swords are in the jet locks on to the land vehicle, but when the swords are out it releases from the land vehicle.</li><li>Snake prison at the back of the vehicle.
</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The treads don't move on wood, have to use something that is not smooth.</li><li>The 2 cockpits can only sit 1 Ninja each, so the other two just have to sit out of the vehicle. </li><li>Lego should have made a attacking thing for the bad guys too, since the only bad stuff are the snakes. They're no match for the Ninjas in this set.</li></ul>
<p>This set is awesome, a great addition to your Ninjago sets. Pretty much one of the biggest Ninjago Ninja's vehicles. 9/10.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"brianashe","2014-10-08T01:44:56.59Z","Looks great, but play gently","<p>Others have given good reviews of this set, so I just wanted to point out one downside I haven&#39;t seen mentioned -- this set is pretty fragile in actual play. The following parts come off very easily in the hands of a typical 8-year-old: the engines and flames, the entire front cockpit, the lights, the tail, the tread-mounted weapons,&nbsp;and the little white &quot;hubcaps&quot;, front and back. The assembly is rather intricate and spindly and the shape is such that it&#39;s not easy to get a good grip on it in many ways. If you like good-looking models, it&#39;s a great set; if you like playing with your builds, you&#39;ll spend a lot of time rebuilding this.</p>
