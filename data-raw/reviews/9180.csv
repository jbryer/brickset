"JayAnderson","2012-06-03T09:17:01.067Z","Very impressive set, both as a stand-alone or to add to your Ninjago collection.","<p>I bought this for my son who is almost 5. We have been watching the shelves in various stores for weeks now and I had promised to go halves with him. Picked it up at Target for AUD$199. Pretty steep IMO, but a promise is a promise (well not quite...I couldn't bring myself to take $100 off of him).</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Packaging and Instructions<br></span></p><p>The box is big, colourful and pretty much sells itself with pictures of the Green Ninja Lloyd all over it. With 915 pieces in the set the box is very full (which makes a nice change). 9 bags in total and 3 very clear and easy to follow instruction books. A few stickers (not many) and I was pleased to see that both the instruction booklets and stickers were in their own bag with a stiff piece of cardboard to keep everything straight.<br></p><p><br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mini Figures</p><p>I think this is the first set where you get the much awaited Green Ninja Lloyd ZX and it is certainly cool to finally get him to go with all the other Ninjas. The set also includes the 4 armed Lord Garmadon, Sensei Wu (with a gold straw hat), Chokun (short orange snake), Jay ZX, Skalidor (black snake) and Acidicus (dark green snake). To be honest my favourites are the last two, as I think the snake models look very cool with no legs and have very nice detailing. They come with a good assortment of weapons, including 6 gold weapons and one of the Hypnobrai fang blades, so that adds to the appeal.</p><p><br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">4 headed Ultra Dragon</p><p>Obviously the centerpiece of the set. The build was very enjoyable. My son is capable of building this on his own, but I sat with him and passed him pieces to speed up the process. Some of the build techniques employed I thought were quite clever and the colour scheme is excellent, in particular the use of the green glass pieces to help with the detailing in the wings and tail. The size of the finished dragon is quite impressive especially with the wings open. The built in handle is very clever and not too obvious or awkward looking and makes the whole playability/swooshability factor go through the roof as you can run around with it without worring about how to hold something of this size without knocking pieces off. The movement of the handle also spreads open the wings, so that when you pick it up, the weight of the dragon causes them to open and when you land, they fold in again, which is a slick feature. Of the 4 dragon heads only the top two can shoot, which is no deal breaker, but oddly enough you get just one projectile in the set. Even the much smaller Earth dragon from the first series came with two.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Great Devourer (aka giant snake)</span></p><p>Up until the actual purchase I didnt think this snake was going to be too big, but ths scale of it, like the dragon I guess, surprised me. Quite easy to put together and I like the use of the different greens. The mouth opens and you can put a ninja (or anyone that gets in the way) inside. My son certainly enjoyed going around biting everything and eating any ninja I wanted to combat him with. Some clever techniques used in the head to create the shape of it. The only down side to the snake is that the upper body doesn't move and is fixed. Once again, not a big deal. It is also top heavy, so can unbalance easily on carpeted surfaces and depending on how vigourous your chomping is the lower jaw can detach.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Snake Prison</span></p><p>I thought this componant of the set was going to be quite ho-hum, but it turned out to be a nice little piece and it certainly compliments the rest of the set. The detail pieces used are very nice and the two prison holding areas (although compact) give you all you need to play out all kinds of captive scenarios. The dripping venom effect that it has going on from the two snake heads makes it look very cool and helps create the atmosphere.<br></p><br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall</span></p>
<p>Fantastic set. You get so much to build and play with that I'd have 
to say if this is your first Ninjago set then it's a great way to start 
off, because there is so much to do. It took my son and I 3.5 hours to build everything and in the last 24 hours he has dismantled and rebuilt the Great Devourer and Snake Prison already (in between some epic snake vs dragon battles and prison escapes).</p><br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of mini figures and plenty of weapons to go around;<br></li><li>The dragon is epic with great detailing;</li><li>Great swooshability and the set as a whole is a fantastic stand alone scenario that can be played over and over; and<br></li><li>A very fun and enjoyable build.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Price - well in Australia at least. I was going to get it regardless, but I could have picked it up cheaper in an upcoming End Of Financial Year Sale no doubt;<br></li><li>4 headed dragon and just one projectile is kind of weak; and<br></li><li>Lack of pose-ability with the Great Devourer.</li></ul><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>I can not recommend this set enough. The cons are minor and the cost is outweighed due to the set having so much playability. My son absolutely loves it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Malurus","2012-11-05T07:41:41.523Z","It's an awesome, giant, epic set!","<p>I just got this set and I'm more than impressed.&nbsp;I sort of got my impresion of what this set was going to have, for instance, I knew it was going to have a Epic Ultra&nbsp;Dragon, an Epic Great Devourer, and a Epic Prison. But it was sort of... bigger, than I imagined, so to say. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Ultra Dragon was obviously the star of the set. It has a very swoshable tail. I think it's neat how the wings open up whenever you pick it up. The build was nice and long, but altogether the build might've taken me 2 hrs. The only part I'm displeased about is the one projectile and the two launchers. However, I'm sure I have a Zamor Sphere or two around here, so I think I'll manage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Great Devourer was very awesome. His build was about half as long as the Ultra Dragon, but I wasn't disapointed. I think it funny how at the back of the box where it shows the imagery, when he eats a ninja, it says, ""Capture the ninja."" I personally delight when the minifigs fit into a creatures mouth and gets hidden when he closes it, but that's just me. The two problems I face are minor. The first one is that the upper body is much heavier than the lower one, which means he falls over a lot. Secondly, the lower jaw falls off WAY to much, meaning those pesky ninja can escape...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Prison is a neat addition. The build was quite decent for a thing of its size. I done get why the ramp can be&nbsp;hinged up and down. I like that acid dump so much&nbsp;I dump acid on Sensei Wu a lot.</p><p>Overall, the price was well worth the reward. The 3 exclusive minifigs are awesome, too!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DutchFlyer","2019-03-16T16:47:48.71Z","The brilliant original of a extremely good re-imagining","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Epic Dragon Battle is the original 2012, (partially) re-imagined in 2019 as the <strong>Ultra Dragon (set 70679)</strong>. This set was the top end set of the 2012 Ninjago sets linked to the &#39;Search of the Fang Blades.&#39; The set consists of three elements: the Ultra Dragon, the Great Devourer and a prison/shrine like structure. This offers a lot of opportunity for play - and so do the minifigures, the majority of them actually being bad guys.</p>

<p>The builds of the Ultra Dragon, the Great Devourer and prison/shrine are fun. Overall it took about 2.5 hours to 3 hours to build this set. Although there are some off-colour&nbsp;pieces used during construction, they are pretty much well covered up.&nbsp; Construction itself is not very difficult. The Technic mechanism forming the core of the flying dragon is well designed. In the end you have a massive dragon, easy to handle, that - as soon as it is picked up - flies away. The Great Devourer is surprisingly large&nbsp;as well. Overall, this is a very good play set, with also quite good display value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I liked this set, and I am glad I was able to get it for a still somewhat reasonable price. It also allows for a comparison between&nbsp;the original&nbsp;and the 2019 Ultra Dragon. Overall, I think this is a very good set. The original was quite expensive, but I would consider that price quite justifiable: two massive animals, numerous bad guys, some structure. I think this set might well be regarded as one of the better Ninjago sets ever.&nbsp;If you can get a 2nd hand set for a reasonable price, I would seriously consider going for it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Building this set was fun, and not that difficult. The recommended&nbsp;building age is 8+, but younger children should be able to build this set. There are a few mildly tricky passages. Sometimes getting the technic pins to connect to a bar is a bit tricky. There are some stickers, that definitely add to the looks. They are of the clear variety, and care needs to be taken when applying them. I think they are useful, and definitely improve the looks of the set.</p>

<p>The dragon - in the end - is constructed in with quite a limited amount of pieces. The mechanism to lift the dragon and to spread its wings is simple but effective. Once the wings are attached, the dragon is also well balanced. Now, once standing, the heads are raised up. Before that, the whole dragon is&nbsp;slumped forward. The design of the dragon is clever, but at no point I was wow-ed by the techniques used.</p>

<p>The Great Devourer is a fairly simple construction as well. That said, the way the head is designed is interesting. The construction was complex, but not difficult. The prison/shrine like structure is fairly standard; the most interesting element was the construction of the snake-heads spitting venom.</p>

<p>There are some intersting&nbsp;elements, starting with the dragon heads. So are the trans-green parts for the wings, and the many of the parts of the Great Devourer (due to their colour). The most interesting parts are the two printed snake-heads for the prison. The prints are absolutely awesome.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>I really like the minifigures. Jay and Lloyd&nbsp;are well done, but their figure is fairly simple. Lloyd is the only one with two prints on the head though. Sensei Wu is already much more interesting. A nice print on front and back of the torso, with the front print nicely continued on the legs.</p>

<p>The fun starts with the bad guys, beginning with Garmadon. This is four-armed Garmadon, and he is equipped with all four of the Golden Weapons. Chocun, Acidicus and Skalidor represent the snake tribes. They all contain well executed specialty heads. Acidicus and Skalidor&nbsp;- as generals - have snake-like bodies. Their torso-prints are continued nicely onto those snake-bodies. Acidicus is armed with a fang-blade, while Skalidor&nbsp;swings a double-axe. All in all, superbly done.</p>

<h2>The design</h2>

<p>The Ultra Dragon in general is indeed ultra: it is massive.&nbsp; The wings are just as big. I like the way they fold, as well as how they look when in flight. There are no true gaping holes, or clearly visible off-colour pieces. I am not a fan of the seat for Lloyd. I also think that the front legs could be better. I like the sweeping tail, but there is no knob/pin to operate it. It just swings. The heads are modeled after their &#39;normal&#39; dragon counterparts: the Earth Dragon, the Ice Dragon, the Lightning Dragon and the Fire Dragon. They have a&nbsp;white base, with the colour referring to these dragons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, this invites comparison with the re-imagining. First of all, there is the fact that the 2019 set has more pieces, and practically all of them are used for the dragon. Yet they are similar in size. The most biggest differences are in the heads and the wings. In the new dragon, the heads are in proportion with the dragon&#39;s body, where in this one the heads are oversized. The wings of the new dragon are nice, but of the plastic plane - variety. The old ones are brick built, and IMHO look very good. Better than many of the old brick built wings. The legs of the new dragon IMHO look better, as does Lloyd&#39;s chair. The tail is about even, IMHO.</p>

<p>The Great Devourer is surprisingly big, something not readily apparent from the images. It actually is taller than the dragon, and it is close to the length of the body of that dragon. The stickers definitely add to the looks of the whole thing. I like the fact that the Devourer can actually devour a minifigure. The one thing that I do not like is some of the off-colours used in the construction of the head. I can agree with the decision to make the snake in the set a colour different from that of the Great Devourer in the TV-series.</p>

<p>The structure/prison/shrine is simple, but effective. I like the overall look, and it could quite easily be incorporated in a bigger structure. The bottom part can be opened from the rear in order to access the underground dungeon. For putting a minifigure in the top dungeon, one has to take off the top.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>IMHO this is a great and massive play set. Good guys vs bad guys, a snake, a dragon to fly around, dungeons, what is not to like. The handle to fly the dragon works well. The handle makes the dragon fairly easy to handle for children. The Great Devourer is fairly stable, though the bottom surface of the dragon is fairly small, which adversely affects its stability.Both the Ultra Dragon and Great Devourer are very swooshable. There is endless possibility for play, especially if the Great Devourer is let loose in any Lego city. The one thing I cannot fathom is why Lego only provided a single sphere for the two dragon mouths that can fire them. The fact that there are four bad guys, and all Golden Weapons are included is also a plus.</p>

<p>The set is also well designed enough and big enough that it can also serve as a display set. The two animals are striking in their looks. And who does not like a big dragon and snake?</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This set is a great set, that was first released in June 2012, and has held up very well over time. It is as good a play set as any, and just as great a display set.&nbsp;Looking at this set, I not only have to commend the designer of the Epic Dragon Battle, but also that of the 2019 Ultra Dragon. The original was IMHO difficult to equal, let alone improve upon - yet he has managed to do so for most aspects.</p>

<p>IMHO it is so good, that I would seriously consider getting this set as a 2nd hand set if you can find it. And those who were able to get it when it was available are IMHO extremely lucky.</p>

It includes both the heroes and the villains coming with both the four headed ultra dragon and the great devourer, which makes it a perfect set and has great value for money as no other sets are required for a complete play experience, it even comes with a small prison/tower build.
