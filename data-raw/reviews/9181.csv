"Gandalf1","2012-05-29T09:02:53.387Z","""A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.""","<p>I picked up this set at the LEGO Store, and I am very pleased with it, though there are a few minor complaints. Here's why:</p>
<h4>Box</h4><div>The box was a little bit hard to open without totally ripping it, but this isn't a new thing. It was very well designed, and had an ad for a LEGO The Lord of the Rings video game.</div><div><h4>Instructions</h4></div><div>The instructions were good and easy to follow, however, for some reason, they never actually tell you to build the minifigures. You just start off with the cart, and once it's finished, it shows Gandalf and Frodo &nbsp;in their spots already assembled. There is also an ad for LEGO The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey sets.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts were good. Some of the interesting ones (to me) are a red <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/search/?query=Ninjago"">Ninjago</a> snake, a yellow 4-stud long wand/rod, a brown book, a wax-sealed letter, a carrot (both parts), largish wagon wheels, and last but most :), the horse. Actually I think it's technically a pony, but whatever. It's a very good new piece, it can balance even while rearing up, and it's just a good update.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div><b>Frodo Baggins</b></div><div>Frodo has the nice new hobbit-hair element in dark brown, a double-sided head, a sand-green shirt with suspenders (or isn't it braces for you Brits? ;D), and short dark-brown pants, with no hobbit feet, though I don't care much about that. The head has a sort of cheerful, peaceful look on one side, and a worried, <i>something's wrong</i> face on the other side.</div><div><b>Gandalf the Grey</b></div><div>The mysterious wizard has a grey, non-printed standard wizard hat, a grey, non-printed standard wizard cloak, :D a grey, non-printed newly molded wizard beard, and grey, non-printed standard wizard pants. The grey, not-quite-standard wizard torso is printed on both front and back, but these printings are almost useless when Gandalf has his beard and cloak on! Oh, and the head. It's not double sided, because really, what would change? He has bushy eyebrows, and even a mouth and everything, but you don't see it unless he shaves.</div>
<h4>The Build</h4><div>The build was not difficult, but there were parts where you feel like you kind of had to figure part of it out for yourself, and that the instructions didn't quite explain it correctly. It uses hinge-pieces to achieve the sloping sides to the cart, and on the horse, a 1x2 brown brick with a 1x2 plate on top fill the cavity in the horse's back.</div>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4><p>The model is neat to look at, and you just <i>have</i> to roll it along and re-enact the scene from the movie. :-)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>A good set, but not <i>quite</i> worth the money. Of course you should buy it anyway, but it seems that they took sets that were worth $9.99, and decided to bring up the price to $10.99, and it still seems like $10. Then they bring it up to $11.99, and then $12.99 where it is now. But aside from the slightly sneaky price-raising on these small sets, this is a good set, and if you want Gandalf, you've gotta get this set. If you want a happy face for Frodo, you'll get that too. Pretty much, if you get only two LEGO Lord of the Rings sets, get this one. If you get only one, make it Shelob Attacks. :D</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

of the Fellowship of the Ring. The box is the only one that isn’t dark and gloomy;
its background is a setting sun over green fields, which is brilliant because
it makes it stand out straight away, despite its small size.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

wasn’t in a bag. The horse was just floating loose in the box, which was great because
it meant I could get straight into making it rear up and show off to the other,
now somewhat boring, horses nearby. I was surprised to find more resistance
than I was expecting when moving the horses’ back legs. There is a slight ‘click’
that you feel more than hear when the horse is fully upright, but the
resistance is good because, if your horse is on a baseplate, you can have it
only rearing up a little. However, without the baseplate the horse can’t
balance unless it is either all the way down or all the way up, which is a
little unfortunate, but still a massive improvement. The rest of the horse is
better as well: it has a longer, swishier tail; a more rounded head and neck,
and improved detailing on its face, which will no longer support the armour for
regular horses.<o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

as the pillars on the four corners for the sides). Given that it’s only 83
pieces it didn’t take very long, but I didn’t rush. When it’s finished, it’s a
little frustrating for a perfectionist like me that Gandalf cannot sit
perfectly centred, he has to sit to one side, which I am finding very annoying.
The back of the cart looks a little empty, so I will be raiding my non-TLotR
sets for awesome accessories so that the other minifigs can envy Gandalf! I
think filling the cart more will also help to stop the one problem I have with
it: The contents of the cart rattles around too much. Even though I was
carrying it as though it were made of glass, I still had to reset all of the
fireworks (they had fallen from the barrel), go back to find the carrot (which
had fallen out altogether), and remove the backpack to get to the letter that
was stuck between the pack and the barrel. Needless to say, that cart won’t be
moving from my shelf for at least 20 minutes, until I want to pick it up and
examine every detail again.<o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

feature of all: The Minifigures. Okay, so you get a happy and carefree Frodo
Baggins, which is a nice change. He is wearing a simple green shirt (which
reveals a little of his chubbiness – something I love about all of the Hobbit
minifigs!) and braces, adding to the laidback feel of the Shire set. Frodo also
has a sad, worried face, which reminded me of our puppy. And you also get
Gandalf the Grey, the disturber of the peace, complete with his fireworks! Gandalf
is, obviously, all in grey. He has detailing on both the front and back of his
torso (as does Frodo), although you can see very little of it after his cloak
and awesome new beard block it. I would have liked the beard to come up a
little more, on the sides and especially on the back, because it is the only
hair he has. I know it would get in the way if you wanted to give the beard to
a minifig with a hair piece, but Gandalf does look a little strange with just
his hair and hat. And, sadly, he only has a single sided head, but I guess this
is fair as you only see his eyes anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

Arrives. For a small set it has a lot going for it. If you’re still not sure,
just get it, even if you end up raiding it for parts (thankfully there is no
flick-fire missile defences to prevent this!). Think about it this way: If you
want the entire Fellowship, you need this set or you will never have a Gandalf

"Sebastian","2012-06-22T07:44:23.287Z","Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.","<p>I wish this proverb would apply to this set as it it heavily overpriced for what you get. This is also the case with&nbsp;some of the other sets in the line but it's really evident here because of the small size.&nbsp;The cart is neat with its dark tan pieces that&nbsp;might reflect the gloomy atmosphere of the plot.&nbsp;The only&nbsp;gripe I have with the design is that they should have used a hinged 2x2 turntable plate so you could steer the cart around. The star in this, of course, is the new horse which was the main incentive for me to get the set. It's even better than I thought and has easily become my favourite moulded piece. The figures are&nbsp;good, too, though they are not the best&nbsp;the line has to offer. Gandalf&nbsp;with his hat is just your ordinary castle wizard, very similar to the one in 5614. I like Frodo a little better because he spurts exactly the two facial expressions (happy/sad)&nbsp;his movie actor Elijah Wood&nbsp;is so (in)famous for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspite of the high price, this is still the perfect starter set for the line and for castle fans the great horse should make it really worth buying.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,2
"Cult_Of_Skaro","2012-07-04T09:02:22.87Z","""A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. He arrives precisely when he means to.""","<p>This set recreates the opening scene of <i>Lord</i>&nbsp;<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Rings:</i>&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Fellowship</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Ring</i> where Gandalf drives into Hobbiton to &nbsp;celebrate Bilbo's birthday. This is the smallest of the LotR sets, and is only an excuse to give us a Gandalf minifigure. However, that does not make it any less a fun set.</p>
<h4>Box</h4><h4><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">The box is small, though it really could have been smaller. On the front, it is decorated with a simple image of Gandalf and Frodo and the cart (inexplicably superimposed over a picture of the Shire at sunset). The back is unusual, in that it does not show any play functions, but not surprising, as there are none. As evidence of LEGO's recent 'green' policy, there is some sort of badge on one of the flaps saying that the box was made out of recycled paper. Another thing that I assume is a recent trend is that on one side, the theme is printed trilinguallly. It says:</span></font></h4><div><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">LEGO: The Lord of the Rings</span></font></div><div><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">LEGO: Le Seigneur des Anneaux</span></font></div><div><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">LEGO: El Se</span></font><font size=""2"">ñor de los Anillos\</font></div><div><br></div><div><font size=""2"">This interested me, because normally, even a international set has its name in English. The set name too is written in two other languages.</font></div><div><font size=""2""><br></font></div><div><font size=""2"">L'arrivée de Gandalf</font></div><div><font size=""2"">La Llegada de Gandalf</font></div><h4>&nbsp;Instructions</h4><p>Nothing to speak of. The booklet has the same artwork on the front as the box. I found no mistakes. After the building section, there is a parts inventory, followed by an advertisement for 9473, the Mines of Moria. After these, there is a checklist showcasing all the LotR minifigs. Instead of just showing one of each minifig, it shows any minifigs who appear in multiple sets the number of times they appear. This is clever on LEGO's part, as it gives the feeling of getting new minifigs every time, even if it's really just a rerun.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>These are surprisingly interesting. There are a lot of bits in Dark Tan, a carrot, some large wagon wheels, and best of all, a new articulated horse. This set is really worth buying multiples of for the sole purpose of the horse. I'm actually considering getting&nbsp;another&nbsp;one so I can mount my Rohirrim soldier from 9471.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two, both really fantastic. They are:</p><p></p><h4>Gandalf the Grey</h4><div>This is the minifig that makes this set a necessity, as it recreates Gandalf's look from the beginning until Moria. He has several new/recolored parts; an updated beard, a Dark Bley cape, and a Dark Bley Wizard hat. However, there is one problem. Gandalf does not have a double-sided head, which means he cannot appear angry, which could be a problem if you're trying to recreate the Balrog scene. I found a solution to this, however. Sir Ian McKellen has two minifigures, Gandalf and Magneto. Magneto's head works very well to give Gandalf that sense of righteous anger.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Frodo Baggins</h4></div><div>This is totally different from the Frodo minifigures in 9472 and 9470. It is the Shire version of Frodo, as opposed to the other one, which I think of as the ""Ring"" version. This is a very nice minifigure. His torso is Sand Green with buttons and suspenders printed on it. His head is entirely different from that of the other version, and has a happy face on one side and a sad face on the other. He has one new piece, the Hobbit hairpiece, which I hope will be used elsewhere in future years.</div><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This is not very interesting, but not unexpectedly so, due to the price tag. I'd like to think its got a more interesting one than other sets of the same price point, such as Catwoman Catcycle City Chase, though I admit I actually don't own the latter.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is really quite pleasing, considering. The cart certainly looks nice, and makes the Hobbit look small in comparison. The one problem I found is that it's impossible to stick Frodo next to Gandalf on the cart. This was rather dissapointiong, and I wish the designers had thought of this, as it would've greatly improved the set IMO.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>If you're a LotR fan, buy it. It's the only way you're going to get Gandalf. If you're a Castle fan, buy it. The cart will look great in a&nbsp;medieval layout. If you like rare parts, this has several uniquely colored ones. If you're a Space fan...Forget about it. Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>-LEGOlas1</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,2
"tkettle9719","2012-07-21T00:01:59.337Z","""An odd-looking wagon with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton...""- J.R.R. Tolkien, ""The Lord of the Rings""","<p>The above line, from the first chapter of the first part of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", basically explains what happens in the scene depicted in the set. Out comes Gandalf, bringing his magically amazing fireworks into the town, along with his horse and wagon. Here, he meets with Frodo, and they converse. It's a beautiful, memorable scene, and is a great, happy introduction to the Lord of the Rings line of sets. It's also the only light set, which makes it very unique. All I can say is that it's amazing.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Lego has once again created a wonderful line of figures and creatures; Gandalf (the Grey) is very awesome and grey, and is exclusive to this set, Frodo is smiling in a luscious green Shire suit, and the new horse has really gone advanced; it can act terrified and raise up!</li><li>-The tan and sand-brown parts really make an excellent wagon upon which Gandalf can sit; it's a simple start to a great line.</li><li>-All of the little details which fill in Gandalf's cart are also really wonderful; a carrot to feed your now adjustable horse, fireworks in a basket, etc...</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Say you're moving the cart throughout your MOC Shire, and you're reenacting a LOTR intro. As you move the cart, it's very possible that the fireworks will fall out of the barrel. As Mad-Eye Moody, Gandalf's brother's (Albus') friend, would say, ""CONSTANT VIGILANCE!""</li><li>-I'm also not a fan of the 1x2 with one stud tile in the cart where the Grey sits; I know that it's probably there to show that the wagon is bumpy, but I want him in the middle.&nbsp;</li><li>-I know that this is really minor and doesn't really matter, but I wish that the pieces which create the whole angle for the wagon are maybe a bit too gray. Making them in brown would make the cart look much better to me.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>While no set can be perfect, I think that this is about as perfect as you can get with this set idea. I think that it's a great representation of the whole ""Lord of the Rings"" line in general, and serves as a great introduction to a line that can end up being really awesome. If you buy a set from the ""LOTR"" this year, make it this!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Hylocera","2012-11-19T21:42:25.1Z","You're late!","<p>To be honest, LEGO's interpretation of the classic opening to the Lord of the Rings is both disappointing yet satisfying. Let's go into a more detailed review of this set.</p><p><strong>The Building Experience</strong></p><p>There really wasn't much of an ""experience"", which isn't unusual for a set of this size. Some interesting techn</p><p>iques were introduced, though, like the angled sides of the wagon.</p><p><strong>The Parts</strong></p><p>Lego really did a great job including some interesting parts in this set, like the book, Ninjago snake, and the figs. I also really enjoyed playing around with the new horse, which is both molded better than earlier versions and is also more posable, due to having jointed hind legs like previous versions had jointed necks. The use of the snake was really good (I'm assuming it's the huge dragon firework that Merry &amp; Pippin set off), and there were some unusual pieces I had not&nbsp;possessed before, like the dark tan bag thing and the carrot. My only issue with the parts is that the book had no ""cover printing"", but that is a minor issue.</p><p><strong>Playability</strong></p><p>I personally created a small forest vignette to recreate Frodo running down the hills to meet Gandalf, but by itself, the set has close to zero playability. You can make Frodo read the book, and make Gandalf feed his horse a carrot, but the wagon itself is awkward to move around and there's not much you can do with it besides moving it around awkwardly. They could've at least added a small tree or some other sort of scenery to make the scene more interesting. The wagon is also a bit large (I believe it's taller than Gandalf even when he's wearing his hat), but it's simple and easy to modify and is packed full of great fireworks, etc.</p><p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p><p>It's honestly probably overkill to write such a long review for such a small set, so if you're just looking for summaries, this is the section for you. The value for money, in my opinion, is the most important part of this set, because, as I stated earlier, there's not much to do with this set other than take it apart and use its great parts in other creations. As a ""to-be-scrapped"" set, it was worth the money, with it's unique color scheme, versatile minifigs, and awesome horse, although I believe a bit of foliage could've been included without a raise in price.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Overall, this is a great set. It disappoints me because it's more recognizable as a generic LEGO wagon than what it is actually named (Gandalf Arrives), but since I tear all my sets apart anyway it satisfies me with it's great variety of parts. 4/5 Overall, thanks for reading! I hope this review is helpful.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-07-30T03:24:42.223Z","The wizard pays a visit, Baggins is excited...initially..... ","LEGO Lotr sets have finally hit the shelves in Sweden. I just bought this a couple of days ago and as soon as I saw the box in my hand I got transferred back to 2001 &amp; the fond memories after watching the first film in the series. Just <i>how cool</i> is it that LEGO has given us sets from these movies? I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for us fans...<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div>It's hard not to like these guys. LEGO has put a lot of heart in these plastic representations of both Gandalf and Frodo. Here's a ""closer look"":</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Gandalf.</b> He is new as a figure though parts are certainly taken from both the Castle and Harry Potter line, only altered in colour. What I like is the torso printing along with the grey overall look. It looks very wizardry. You can't go wrong with that pointy hat and the wand/staff. His face is somewhat hidden in his huge beard but the face itself is very cool, not double-sided. On the other hand, he shouldn't have to - being a wizard it might be better to be stern whether you are happy or angry. Game-face.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Frodo.</b> I believe this one might be a bit unusual, a possible collectable? Here we have the Shire Frodo, before everything starts to become one major turmoil, quite different from the quiet, calm hobbit life. Frodo has a double-sided face, I think they have captured the emotions quite well. Frodo seems to sway from happiness to light despair. The green shirt with suspenders looks good. The hair is spot on hobbit hairstyle.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>Horse &amp; cart.</h4><div>This brown horse is just grand in so many ways. The colours and the printing is great. Way cooler is the fact that it is able to prance. That feature is new and will be useful for brick-filmers and display action. The cart included is very fun to build. It is much more sturdy than many carts from other themes from a different year (for instance <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7189-1"">Mill Village Attack</a>). Smart design and has a bit of a rugged feel to it. It also comes with quite a lot of things, fireworks, a book, a carrot among other things. The wheels also roll as they should. It almost becomes as an obsession for me to just give it a swift roll, if the set is too close to my desk. I guess that means that LEGO did a good job with the set?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>Summary thoughts.</h4><div>I like this set a lot. Could be that I'm a bit bias, as with LEGO Star Wars, but I really believe this is a very good set. Partly because of what it represents to me as a fan of the theme (the books, poems, songs, the movies and legacy of what Tolkien created), but also for the great possibilities the parts and/or the figures have if you want to create something from your imagination. The only downside could be with the price, though I KNOW it's a licensed theme, so it probably needs to be a bit more pricier. This is the first slice we have from the Shire, so I won't be picky about details.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>It's a real LOTR set. No MOC.</li><li>You get 2 great minifigures.&nbsp;</li><li>You get cool horse.</li><li>You get a sturdy, well-filled cart.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>I was going to go for the price-point, but I decided not to be picky.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"CapnRex101","2012-07-30T18:43:00.987Z","9469 - Gandalf Arrives","<p>This is the smallest set of the Lord of the Rings theme so far (excluding polybags) and is actually a very nice little model in my opinion. It includes two excellent Minifigures, both of which are exclusive to this set, although this Frodo figure also appears in a polybag, but I do not really count that one as the polybag is unreleased in the UK at the time of writing. There are some lovely pieces included in the set and is an accurate recreation of a charming scene as it appears in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring film.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The image on the small box is fantastic in my opinion. It features the moment that Gandalf draws up in to Hobbiton on his cart as Frodo greets him which is well recreated in Lego here. The background shows a tranquil countryside scene with the sun setting far off in the distance and some long grass in the foreground which is very realistic indeed. Along the top of the box cover is the Lego Lord of the Rings logo and a shot of the One Ring of Power on Sauron's finger with a faint map of Middle Earth visible behind it. On the back of the box are several images of different aspects of the set, as there are really no features. There is also a small advertisement for the upcoming Lego Lord of the Rings game and in the background is some more of the map of Middle Earth.</p><p>The instructions share the same image on the cover as the box and I found no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces. In the back of the booklet is a gallery of all of the Lord of the Rings Minifigures released in this first wave of sets and there is an advertisement for set 9473, The Mines of Moria as well.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are lots of excellent parts in this set as I mentioned above. These include one of the brand new horses which I think are superb, a relatively large amount of dark tan and tan for such a small set, and two large cart wheels which are very useful I find. We also get a brown book, a carrot (which is fairly rare), a red Ninjago snake, which only comes in one other set, and a brown barrel. These accessories are quite extraordinary given the size and cost of the model and there are two lovely new hair piece moulds. Gandalf has a brand new beard (so a sort of hair piece) and Frodo has an incredibly accurate dark brown piece for his somewhat unique hair style. All in all, an amazing selection of parts!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two Minifigures included, the first of which is <b>Frodo Baggins</b>. This figure is exclusive, but for a polybag, as in this set he is wearing the casual clothes he does in the movie unlike the other sets with Frodo included. I will begin at the top with the new hair piece which is seen on all of the three Frodo figures and is a brilliant piece in my opinion as it perfectly recreates the style from the movie. It is cast in dark brown with lots of texture and I absolutely love it. The head piece too is outstanding, it is printed with two expressions which is always nice, the first of which has brown eyebrows and a cheerful expression which really does resemble Elijah Wood in the film. On the other side is a slightly concerned expression with the same brown eyebrows as the alternative face.&nbsp;</p><p>His torso is printed just like his outfit in the film and is predominantly sand green which looks fantastic. The collar of his green buttoned shirt is open and he is wearing brown braces and a nice studded belt. There are lots of creases in the garment which adds a bit more realism to the appearance of the figure. The back is also printed with his braces crossing over, the rest of his belt, and some more folds in the fabric of the shirt. The arms are sand green like the torso and his hands are flesh coloured. Being a Hobbit, Frodo does of course have short legs, which are brown like the trousers he wears in this scene. One accessory is included for him, and that is the book he is seen reading in the film as Gandalf arrives in his cart. The book piece can be opened and closed, but can only be held by the figure in the open position.</p><p>The other Minifigure included is the legendary wizard, <b>Gandalf the Grey</b>. This figure is totally exclusive to this set which makes it a little more special and is extremely accurate to his movie appearance as one would hope. He wears a large dark grey wizard's hat which is not a new mould, appearing previously in Harry Potter and Castle sets among others, but never before in dark grey. A buckle is moulded in to the piece and there are some folds in the hat, which look lovely. It would be nice to have some printing on the buckle to make it stand out a little more, but the component still looks awesome. His head is printed on just the one side with a smile, cheek definition, some wrinkles around his eyes, and very bushy eyebrows. I can completely understand the piece only being printed on one side as the reverse is not covered unlike on the Frodo Baggins figure. The brand new light grey beard part is excellent with plenty of moulded texture and an accurate look to that of Gandalf so it suits him very nicely. I hope to see this beard used again in the future. Gandalf also wears a dark grey cape which matches the rest of his outfit.</p><p>His torso is printed with his crease ridden grey robe, a rope crossing his chest, and a brown belt with a silver buckle. This design looks marvellous but is in fact mostly obscured by his long beard. The back too is printed with the rest of his creased robe, the rope crossing his chest and the belt, which is also covered up, this time by the cape. The arms are grey and his hands are flesh coloured. His legs too are plain grey with no printing which looks fine as there is not really anything of note seen on Gandalf's legs in the film anyway. He carries his staff which is formed by a brown stick piece, simple, but it does the job well and short of making yet another new piece, this is as good as it gets I think.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Being a small set, the build is very short, only about ten minutes, but actually features some fun construction techniques. The way in which the sides of the cart are attached is quite clever and the shape has been achieved very well indeed. The back panel of the vehicle too is attached using clips which works really nicely. That is really about it, but given the size of the set, this is not bad at all and I enjoyed it.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is really wonderful in my opinion and I am delighted with it overall. The brand new horse which pulls the cart is brown and is printed with white patches of hair on its face. Black reins are visible on the head of the animal as are the eyes of course. This new horse can now not only move its head, but also rear up on its hind legs which is very nice indeed. The legs are moulded in to a cantering position which is more realistic than the old static looking horse.&nbsp;</p><p>The cart is attached to the horse using a grey horse hitching and at the front of the cart is a place for Gandalf to sit, slightly offset to the right of the vehicle. Behind this seating area is the main storage area of the cart which has a dark tan bag and a barrel in it. In the barrel are three fireworks, including a red snake which is intended to be the dragon firework set off by Merry and Pippin during Bilbo Baggins' birthday party, for which Gandalf has come to Hobbiton. A carrot is found back here along with an envelope which is found in the bag. I believe this is the envelope in which Gandalf places the One Ring of Power for safe keeping. The cart rests on two large wheels which look absolutely brilliant.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is an excellent set for the price and is a must have for any Lord of the Rings fan as it includes one important member of the Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf the Grey, who is exclusive to this model and is a key character of course. This Frodo figure too is lovely and is exclusive to this set (other than the currently uncommon polybag). The cart itself is very nice indeed and the accessories are extraordinary. However the playability of the set may be a little low for younger children as there are no features as such, nor is there any conflict in this scene, so I am going to dock a point for that as there may be other sets which appeal more to this age group.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

This set is perfect for an introduction of the LotR theme, due to the fact that it includes two main characters: Gandalf the Grey and Frodo Baggins. Even at $13 dollars, this set is worth every penny.

The likeness to actor Elijah Wood is uncanny. He's wearing a light green buttoned shirt with brown overalls. His face has two sides: smiling and scared. The new Hobbit hair is perfect. His accessory is a book, true to the movie (despite the fact that the book is comically large when compared to him).</p><p>2. <strong>Gandalf the Grey</strong> - Fantastic. In this set, he wears his grey robes, which don't have a lot of detail (which is okay, since his torso is covered up by his cape and beard). He wears a dark grey cape and a dark grey hat, and carries his staff with him (admittedly, it would've been nice if his staff&nbsp;resembled the one from the trilogy).</p><p><strong>PARTS</strong> - This set includes a nice selection of parts: a brown book, the Ninjago snake in red, a letter, a carrot, a wizard hat, Hobbit hair, the brilliantly designed new horse, and some fireworks.

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-06T09:36:50.303Z","Gandalf and Shire Frodo","<p><strong>Set #9469 Gandalf Arrives: </strong>In 2012 when this first hit retailers shelves this was the only method for owning a Gandalf the Grey Mini-Figure, to complete your Fellowship you had to buy this set. It was also the only set to feature Shire Frodo until the Polybag arrived. Now... Gandalf has become the most common Mini-Figure appearing across both LotR and Hobbit Themes in over 10 sets, one of which is quite impressive in scale and look. So is this set a necessary set for your collection?</p>
<p>Read on and find out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Being a 14.99$ set (when it originally arrived) this set's box is pretty standard for that size range and price. It shows off the set, the back shows a few minor play features of the set (none of them gimmics) and that's it. The design might be simple, but it's pretty nice overall.</p>
<p>The instructions are also standard, considering the size of the model is it any surprise to find this is only 23 pages long? It has easy to follow directions for building, a Mini-Figure checklist for 2012 LotR sets (Except the Polybags) and that's all there is to say really.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>To be honest I don't think this set has any rare or unique parts, it just has standard pieces. I stand corrected, there is the new Robber Backpack piece seen in LEGO City sets, if you don't particularly care for LEGO City and aren't collecting it this will be your first time picking one of these up and they do look very nice.</p>
<p>You also get a red snake piece from Ninjago, which is a unique color for the piece I do believe. It wasn't common at any rate, here it's meant to be the large firework that Gandalf made in the film for Bilbo's party.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Gandalf the Grey, there's really nothing new to say about him. He's the same version we've come to expect in LEGO form from the LotR Theme and The Hobbit. He's got the same accessories as every other Gandalf, the cape, his staff, the only thing missing is Glamdring since this is before he had it in the films.</p>
<p>Shire Frodo is the same version from the&nbsp;Cooking Corner Polybag with the same printing, and a book.</p>
<p>Honestly they aren't bad Mini-Figures, the trouble is LEGO made them so readily available since their initial plans involving the Fellowship being split up between all the sets of 2012 that they aren't really that impressive. For a set this size they are also uninspiring, I honestly would have preferred seeing at least one other Hobbit in this set, preferably one we didn't get in any of the other sets, an older Bilbo perhaps or Sam's girlfriend. Sure they don't match up with the Scene the set is aiming to re-capture, but since when has that ever stopped LEGO from providing good Mini-Figures? If some license themes can have 4, once even 5 Mini-Figures included in sets this small what changed to make that so difficult for other Themes?</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The cart in this set is a fun build, it more than makes up for the lackluster Mini-Figures and really, it's one of the main reasons why I still bought it. (Aside from my Completist nature.)</p>
<p>Building the sides of the cart is a real treat, and the opening back section is great as a play feature.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished model features as close an interpretation in LEGO form as you're ever going to see for that Cart Gandalf rode in on, it might not be as large, but it does serve its purpose well. My one complaint would be the means Gandalf sits on it, because this makes it impossible not to bend or wreck his cape when he is sitting on the cart.</p>
<p>If the model had worked around this feature to accomodate it, as The Wizard Battle managed to do for Saruman it would score a bit higher mark. As it stands, if not for the new Horse piece and the interesting looking firework accessories this model might not get as high a rating as it does.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, unless you're aiming to purchase the entire run of LEGO's Lord of the Rings you can definitely skip this set. While it does include a new horse piece, a few interesting accessories and a great looking model I'm afraid the fact that the Mini-Figures in it are so easy to come by after the fact that buying it at this late stage of your LotR collecting would be rather pointless.</p>
<p>Especially seeing as how most stores have it rarely in stock and have bumped the price up, TRU Canada is asking 16.99$ for this set if memory serves (when they have it in stock)&nbsp;and that is decidedly not worth the price of the contents.</p>
<p>Still I can't fault LEGO for what they were aiming to do when first introducing the LotR Theme. And honestly Shire Frodo is not as easily found as I recall, still with the Polybag out there circulating it isn't too difficult to find it.</p>
<p>Only recommended for completists of the Theme and some-what recommended as a parts pack if you really want more of the new horses.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,2,3
"lkb57","2014-02-04T19:06:21.173Z","A Fantastic Start to a Fantastic Theme","<p>Wow! What a great set. Is it small? Yes. Is it fairly simple? Yes. But despite that, in just 83 pieces, TLC managed to put together a perfect rendition of Gandalf&#39;s arrival in Hobbiton for Bilbo&#39;s 111th birthday.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too special here, although the use of a red cobra piece as the dragon firework that Gandalf infamously sets off over Bilbo&#39;s party is a clever move and a fantastic addition to the set. Also, I believe this is the first set to feature Lego&#39;s new horse model . . . and I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m impressed. Without looking too different from the earlier model, this new horse adds a ton of playability and &quot;pose-ability&quot; for AFOL MOCers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gandalf is superb, with a new beard mold and a torso with front and back printing. As far as Frodo goes, I&#39;ve heard people complain about the simplicity of this model as if that&#39;s a bad thing. . . well, I couldn&#39;t disagree more! This version of Frodo is supposed to be simple. He is still living a carefree life in the Shire . . . his quest lies ahead of him. In this version of Frodo we get a front-and-back printed torso which captures Frodo&#39;s Shire attire perfectly. Both minifigures are superb, IMO.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a simple model, so I was surprised to find the build quite enjoyable. I was especially pleased with the construction of the sides of the cart&ndash;&ndash;with just a few pieces and the use of a clever building technique, the designers managed to give the cart an ornate, hand-crafted look that matches the look of the movie cart nicely.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In short, this is a fantastic set, one that any LOTR/Hobbit collector should jump to get their hands on. You&#39;ll only need one, but it&#39;s definitely worth the cost.</p>

purchasing this set. The box contains two bags and a new LEGO horse with
moveable back hips. The set contains two minifigures, Gandalf the Grey and
Frodo. The build itself is surprisingly interesting for such a small set. The
sides of the wagon in particular look incredible. It functions quite well and
stays true to the movie. Within the wagon is a letter addressed to Merry, a
carrot, and three fireworks, one of which looks suspiciously like a snake. When
seated in the front of the wagon, Gandalf does not fit comfortably with his
cape on. I would suggest removing the cape before seating him to minimize
creasing on the cape. Another thing I would have like to see is the point where
the wagon and horse connect should turn. It isn’t very realistic when playing
to have no points of motion besides the wheels. There also aren’t any reigns
for Gandalf to control his wagon with. He must have a trusting horse! Besides
these few flaws, the set is truly a great buy and packs a lot of detail into
such a small space. </span></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

Both figs are beautifully rendered, especially Frodo, who's green and brown outfit is perfectly designed. Gandalf is generally lovely, although I would have loved if they could have found a way to incorporate his signature long hair, even if it were as an alternative piece to the hat. As of now, he looks like he's bald. Also, I understand the expense of making a new, infrequently used mold, but I really would have liked his staff to be a bit more than a brown stick. That being said his face gets the eyebrows just right, and having a Gandalf minifig is such a thrill to begin with.</div><div><br></div><div>Parts-10/10-Lots of useful pieces. We get the new articulated horse, two big wagon wheels, a barrel, a book, a carrot, and a Ninjago snake (used as a firework). That's better than most sets that are twice as large.</div><div><br></div><div>Build-10/10-Small sets usually aren't much of a thrill in this department, but this one certainly was. Watching the sides of the wagon come together in the way they do almost felt like assembling an actual horse cart.

I also love the ""wooden"" posts on either side. They really give the whole thing an appropriately rustic feel. My only issue is that there are small gaps between the sides and bottom, allowing small items to occasionally fall through.</div><div><br></div><div>Accuracy/Fan Service-10/10-The model absolutely captures the charm of the scene and looks just like its movie counterpart, and the fireworks are a great detail, especially the big dragon firework. Also, I love that this Frodo gets a different face from the other version. He's less weary and more cheerful here, which is perfect as he has not yet received the ring or been injured by the Witch-King. I love having a more youthful Frodo.</div><div><br></div><div>Playability-9/10-No actual play features, but they aren't necessary here, and would likely feel forced and tacked on. Clip-clopping Gandalf around on his cart is great fun, and the multitude of props adds a lot of playability.

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>Oftentimes in these small sets it is the minifigures that either make or break the set, in this case I would say they make the set. While Gandalf may be incredibly common, this one at least includes his hat and cape which to me makes it a much more valuable minifigure than the ones missing one or both of these wardrobe features.&nbsp;</p>

While this minifigure&nbsp;does appear in a <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30210-1/Frodo-with-cooking-corner"">polybag</a> and is rather easy to obtain, the polybag is a truly pointless set so I would highly recommend picking up this set of you want this minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now technically it&#39;s not a minifigure, but the set also comes with a brown horse which of course can be quite useful to add to your LOTR collection as I feel these sets don&#39;t usually give you enough horses and this new design is an excellent improvement over my horses from the 80&#39;s. The only problem is you don&#39;t get a saddle in this set, but those are easy enough to obtain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>This is definitely a parts set. Considering how few parts there are in the set, there sure are a lot of cool ones. You of course get the two wheels and the harness. Then you get a cobra which resembles the firework that Merry and Pippin set off. You also get a barrel, a thieves backpack, a carrot, and a book. Certainly not a bad selection of parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s simple, but what do you expect. I still enjoy the way you build the sides of the cart, and while I may have been able to design that myself, the corner posts were rather ingenious using the lamp holders that were so prevalent in Classic Space. The set may not be as intricate as<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79000-1/Riddles-for-the-Ring""> Riddle for the Ring</a>, but it is still fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Like I said, if you want this alternative Frodo, this is the set to get him in. It&#39;s also good if you are looking for a cheap way to get a horse. Otherwise, it isn&#39;t anything to special. The playability is rather limited, certainly you wouldn&#39;t want to be fighting orcs with this cart. So if Frodo and the horse don&#39;t interest you, and you aren&#39;t trying to complete your LOTR&nbsp;collection, you may want to save your money for something else. However, if you own the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79003-1/An-Unexpected-Gathering"">Bag End</a> set, this horse carriage would look great parked in front of it.&nbsp;</p>

The minifigures are what you would expect from the set, Frodo and Gandalf are obvious choices but it would have been fun to have another hobbit haswell. There are some nice usage of parts, i especially like the use of the red ninjago snake&nbsp;as a firework.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though its just a wagon, the set has a certain vibe to it that makes it seem more than just a wooden crate on four wheels. It was fun to build even tough it was on the smaller side and it really works great along with my other lotr sets.</p>

<p>if you find it for a good price i defiantly&nbsp;recommend picking it up&nbsp;</p>

<p>solid 7/10</p>
