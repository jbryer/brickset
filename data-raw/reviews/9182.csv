<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Great <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">small</span> sized box with beautiful map and one ring on the front, and taped box for easy opening.&nbsp; I'm glad they are cutting down on box sizes, it was getting pretty ridiculous.&nbsp; The instructions were folded in half once, but other than that, in fine shape.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not sure if there are any new pieces in the spider or extra rock section, but the 'one ring' is awesome.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised to find 3 extra rings in my set, so 4 rings, seem like a good haul so far.&nbsp; (No doubt over the length of the theme, the ring will be common place)&nbsp; I do like the abundance of red brown connectors, but nothing new.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Gollum - He's grown on me since seeing early pictures, His huge eyes and weird little loin cloth put a smile on my face.&nbsp; He's a little top/front heavy, especially when carrying his fish so juicy sweet.&nbsp; I like the fact that his arms are similar to SW droid arms, but are less mechanical, I was worried at first</p>Frodo - His hair, the same as all of the hobbits seems a little big for his size, but that's my only minor complaint.&nbsp; Printing on his torso and double sided face are brilliant, with the white zombie-like eyes being especially memorable.&nbsp; Thankfully there are two copies of his trusty dagger 'sting' too. <br><br>Sam - With his short cape and orange/red hair piece, Sam is a great fig.&nbsp; His torso printing seems straight from the movie, and his stern look fits the character, ready to protect Frodo at all costs.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Short build, a total of 30 minutes, and that was with 'The Fellowship' going on in the background to get me in the LOTR mood.&nbsp; The legs of Shelob are obviously repetitive, but that is no problem.&nbsp; My favorite part was shape of the great spider, and the white string contraption in the back.&nbsp; Very simple use of the string, but built so that you can hang the spider easily without any slipage.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Great finished product, though the small stone section seems pretty pointless when Shelob gets all the attention.&nbsp; The fact that there are more joints in the legs, and the spider is big enough to be in proportion, it is a great model.&nbsp; I actually hung it up on the drapes and totally scared my roommate last night!<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Well worth the 20 dollars to purchase this set, and creating some caves to showcase this beast is definitely in my future.&nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-19T09:27:53.167Z","Unfriendly neighbourhood spider-woman.","Fans of giant spider invasions, your time has finally come around once again! Gone is the somewhat-goofy-looking Aragog as seen most recently in Hagrid's Hut (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=4738-1"">4738</a>), and behold: ladies and gentlemen, weighing in at some 200 pieces and hailing from Ephel Duath, Shelob the Ungoliant! Oh yeah, and you also get Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Gollum, along with a little cave for the horrible creature to skulk around in.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I usually don't make comments on the packaging, but I feel that I must here: the design of the box is just plain cool, probably much more so for people who have even a passing affinity for the Lord of the Rings. For the first time, though, I did notice a curious omission in my instructions, and I'm wondering if someone else who has this set can weigh in on this here to see if I'm just crazy or something: on page 26, in step 3, we are told to place the grey joint that will connect Shelob's abdomen to the rest of her. This grey piece seems to mysteriously disappear in step 5 on page 27 and then reappear for the rest of the instructions. Perhaps my eyesight/sanity is finally going in my old age, but that did catch my eye.</div><div><br></div><div>But anyway, back to the set itself.&nbsp;I haven't quite worked out the exclusivity of the Minifig distribution amongst the various Lord of the Rings sets, but I'm&nbsp;<i>fairly&nbsp;</i>certain that the three that you get with Shelob Attacks - that is, if you count Gollum as one - are exclusive to this set, though Frodo appears with different outfits and expressions in other sets (this is my first from the LOTR line, you see). Gollum's ""Minifig"" representation is decent, conveying a suitable amount of creepy otherworldliness to make you feel suitably uncomfortable, and the two Hobbits are adorable. Their torso printing is ridiculously detailed and true to life. I don't know if the hairpiece has been used before, but it works extremely well for them. Accessories-wise, you get a couple of neat things, chief among them being the titular One Ring, a chrome-plated piece that fits neatly around one stud and therefore a Hobbit's (or Dark Lord's?) hand. I can see a lot of MOC potential for this type of piece if it is ever reproduced en masse in the future, but, for now, it works nicely as a ring. You also get Sting, a couple of swords, a juicy fish for Gollum, and the Phial of Galadriel, which is nothing more than a ""jewel"" piece held upside-down for effect. Curiously, my set came with an extra non-Sting sword and two other rings. I think I'll let <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sh031"">Magneto</a> hold one and see what happens.</div><div><br></div><div>The secondary build here is, as mentioned, a small cave for Gollum. It's rudimentary at best, but points must be given for designers giving it some playability, as opposed to just being a piece of decorative furniture. One is able to place Gollum on a little platform and fling him onto one of the unsuspecting Hobbits, preferably the stupid fat one. I imagine that one would be able to integrate this fairly easily into The Mines of Moria (9473) if one so desires.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we have Shelob herself, and boy is she something. Arguably the creepiest character in the Lord of the Rings pantheon, our version of Shelob is quite a feat of LEGO engineering. Immediate props must be given for the fact that her face is printed and not a sticker, though that's far from the only nice thing about her. Her chief feature, I suppose, is that her abdomen houses a roll of white string that, of course, acts as her ""webbing"" with which she can ensnare unsuspecting Hobbits. LEGO was also nice enough to include a hook to tie to the end of the string so that one could conceivably hang her around the room - not advisable if you're an arachnophobe. And, as with so many ""action figure""-ish designs nowadays, Shelob is completely posable. Her legs move, her mandibles move, her face moves, her abdomen moves. And while she does have a slightly boring build (eight identical legs, go figure), the final result is worth it. Shelob is very menacing.</div><div><br></div><div>And yet, considering Shelob's huge size, you might have difficulty integrating her into the rest of your Lord of the Rings/Castle display. Of course, you keep her hidden away in some cave, but I think that that would be doing her disrespect. I mentioned giant spider invasions at the beginning of this review, and I meant just that:</div><div><br></div><div>http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/UtarEmpire/shelobattacksthumb.jpg</div><div><br></div><div>Shelob easily finds a secondary career as a movie monster. Thor doesn't stand a chance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"Don","2012-05-29T19:02:38.893Z","Arachnophobes Beware!","<p>I just finished putting together the Shelob Attacks set.&nbsp; Here are some thoughts:<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Comes with two of the new ""Sting"" swords, plus a Roman gladius-type sword.<br></li><li>Comes with three(!) gold minifig rings<br></li><li>Gollum minifig!&nbsp; (and Frodo and Sam, of course)<br></li><li>Very nicely articulated model</li><li>The spinneret assembly is nice; the pieces used ensure it can support Shelob's full weight.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Some repetitive building what with the eight legs and all (can't be helped, really).<br></li><li>This may sound silly, but if you are arachnophobic, putting this set together may be a little unsettling.<br></li></ul>
<p>Shelob is probably the best spider model Lego has ever put out. Being a little bit of an arachnophobe, I started getting the a slight case of the willies once I started putting the swiveling pieces for the base of the legs.&nbsp; It got worse once the legs were finished, and putting the abdomen on at the end didn't make things any better, LOL.</p><p>Kudos to the designer(s) of this model.&nbsp; I can't help but think it's about to come alive in my hands when I pick it up!</p><p>Here's a little <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdfBa7yTpts"">YouTube video of the completed model </a>that I just put up.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
"Cult_Of_Skaro","2012-06-07T12:33:35.57Z","She could do it for usss, preciousss...","<p>These just appeared in the Nashville LEGO store week before last, and, not being able to avoid buying at least one, I picked up this and Uruk-Hai Army.</p>
<h4>Box</h4><div>Very nice. On the front it showcases the set on a background of Cirith Ungol, and on the back it has detailed images of the play functions, i.e. Shelob's spiderweb and Gollum's catapult.</div><h4>Instructions</h4><p>These were actually surprisingly poor. At one point, a piece disappears and reappears for no apparent reason, and then at another point the 1 x 4 plates on the underside momentarily move to the top. Poor quality control on LEGO's part, IMO.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Pretty darn good, I'd say. Couple bits in new colors, especially the main parts of the&nbsp;abdomen, not to mention a neat printed brick for the eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Spectacular. They are all (If on a technicality) exclusive to this set. They are:</p><p></p><h4>Samwise Gamgee</h4><div>Totally exclusive. He has a nice torso pattern with suspenders and his pouch of cooking goods, not to mention a new head print and hair color. Sam makes this set a necessity for all those wishing to have a complete set of the Fellowship of the Ring.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Frodo Baggins</h4></div><div>Partially exclusive. Instead of the green cape toted at Weathertop, he has a grey cloak of Lorien.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Gollum/Smeagol</h4></div><div>Totally exclusive, and one of the best figs I've ever seen. On the front, he has a suitably livid face, and a loincloth that continues onto the back, which also has his famous strands of grey hair. Hopefully, we'll get a Smeagol version at some point, with a sad face rather than an evilly angered face.</div><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I seriously don't think I've ever seen a better one for a set of this size. Shelob is simply bursting with detail. I especially loved the part near the front with the three angled plates making the curved front. Kudos to whatever designer made this!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks just like the spider from the movie. But that's not all that it's good for. The hook at the end of the string gives this another helpful function. Let's just say that your spending for decorations and your spending for LEGO doesn't&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;have to be separate.</p>

"tkettle9719","2012-07-02T15:13:58.857Z","Shelob: The Greatest Lego Spider Set Ever!","<p>I got this set, along with the Cap cycle set at Target about a week ago, forgetting how great the Shelob scene was in both the novel version and the movie, which I have recently rewatched. The spider is brilliant, as you will soon discover, and the minifigs are just as good as the rest of the set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Shelob has a stinger, string, facial details, etc. etc. It is the most brilliant spider Lego could ever have made. Perfect. &nbsp;</li><li>-Gollum, who I've been awaiting for a very long time, is brilliant. He looks superb, and the fish makes him look even greater.&nbsp;</li><li>-The hobbits are great. The hair of both hobbits are nice and colored well, and the swords are great. The ring is also very unique.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The crane is not as cool as it could have been for the stinger; it works, but it's very unrealistic to me.&nbsp;</li><li>-I wish that build for Shelob could have been much less repetitive; the legs are the main culprit, but they couldn't be helped.&nbsp;</li><li>-Also, I wouldn't mind paying an additional five dollars to have a bigger cave to create a bigger scene, or more webs.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This is probably one of the best Lego sets I've ever had the chance to build; it's brilliant, smart, and not overly complex. It's really a great set, what with Shelob's detail, the minifigs, weapons (especially Sting), and even a little setting area with play functions. Definitely get this set if you're a LOTR fan. You'll not be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Almaras","2012-06-10T01:45:51.303Z","Greatest. Spider. Ever.","<font size=""4""><p>This is a wonderfully creepy set! It is much darker than Gandalf Arrives, and has a just plain evil feel to it!</p>
<p>Shelob herself is so much bigger than I was expecting! The most comparable Lego spider would be Aragog from the newest Hagrid’s Hut set, but even this is no comparison. Aragog’s detailing is great, even down to the single, weeping eye that has swollen shut after tasting the bite of Samwise the Brave’s sword! Her body is solid, which is great, but if it were any heavier her legs may struggle a little. In saying that, her legs are really well made! They are sturdy and completely adjustable, and do actually support her. She can open and close her mouth and adjust her pincers, and her back half can be rotated 360 degrees and can be adjusted up or down. Lastly, the web function. The reel works perfectly. The length of string provided is really long, which allows for limitless practical joking opportunities! The hook serves its purpose and will hold Shelob’s weight (providing your knots hold, of course!).</p>
<p>The other part of the build is Gollum’s little cave. It’s small, but it is also a nice little feature. The catapult works well, flinging Gollum further than I expected. Unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get Sam to balance long enough to be launched onto Shelob. But I guess Gollum ambushing the filthy hobbitses is fun enough!</p>
<p>And the minifigs: Frodo is in his standard travelling clothes, with a miniature grey cloak. His torso has front and back printing, once again highlighting his chubbiness (as does Sam’s). His face has double sided printing, one showing the strain of the burden he carries, the other with big blue eyes and an open mouth in panic. But best of all: The One Ring (plus a spare!) and Sting. The ring is incredible, all nice and shiny, and Sting looks just like its original, which is fantastic. But not as fantastic as the courage shown by Samwise Gamgee, the Brave! Like Frodo, Sam is in his travelling attire, and has his determined face on, or his scared face on, whatever you decide. But it is Gollum who steals all the attention. I was a little worried about Gollum before opening the box, but the pictures do not do him justice. His creepiness is certainly portrayed in the small minifig, and the few strands of hair on the back of his head are awesome. But, unfortunately, the only movability he possesses is in his arms. He is a great minifig, Lego have done an awesome job, but I would have like to have been able to turn his head, even if only slightly. I also hope we get a Sméagol alternative, because I really do love Sméagol!</p>
<p>And that’s Shelob Attacks. It is a brilliant set! Shelob is incredible, you get The One Ring and Sting, and two exclusive minifigures: Samwise and Gollum.</p></font>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-26T11:36:19.967Z","The Best LEGO Spider","<p><strong>Set #9470 Shelob Attacks: </strong>Fans of Tolkiens world have long imagined the gruesome sight that is Shelob, a massive spider the likes of which hasn't been seen on this Earth for... Well ever, it's a fantasy creation pure and simple, and for us Arachnaphobes the worst possible thing we could run into in a dark cavern under the earth.</p>
<p>It also makes for a brilliant idea for a LEGO set, it's an iconic moment from Return of the King (The Film) and it features a creature ripe for clever build choices and design. (And after seeing what LEGO did for Aragog I was a bit leery of what we'd be getting with Shelob.)</p>
<p>Fortunately my fears were groundless, read on and find out why.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is standard fare from LEGO, it's a good eye catching design. You won't miss it on the shelf, which pretty much can be said of all LEGO box designs in recent years, they've evolved into quite an artistic look compared to what I remember of the older, simpler designs in my childhood back during the late 80's early 90's.</p>
<p>The instruction manual was not protected, most unfortunate, however I didn't get one that was mangled or anything like that. Not like some other sets I could name, honeslty I can understand there's a cost involved there, but LEGO must find a way to ensure that the sets do not suffer from being packaged too roughly, especially as the instructions are the most important aspect of the set pre-built. Lord of the Rings seems to have been one of the first Themes to include the Minifigure checklists in the back of the manuals, other sets from 2012, such as all the Super Heroes sets and a fair number of the Star Wars ones do not feature this handy design choice.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I'm not well versed in the names of a lot of parts, still this set doesn't have many that are too unique. Although I like the fact that there aren't any stickers and they used printed elements for the spider's face. The gear mechanism for the spider-silk play feature is loaded with some decent technic parts that are useful for MOCers though. And there are a lot of click joints for the legs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Back in 2012, before The Hobbit sets hit, you could only find Gollum in this set. And indeed this is still the only set with Gollum showing off his Smeagol face print. (The happier, less menacing expression.)</p>
<p>Gollum is a single sculpted piece with two attachable arms, much different from standard Mini-Figures. You do get to see how lanky he looks, unfortunately this Mini-Figure will never be capable of mimicking what you see him do on screen, or even in the Game. Still he's a decent looking design for a Mini-Figure of Gollum and he has a unique print which makes him worth getting if all you're interested in are the Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>You also get two Hobbits, the bland, seen in every set practically Frodo. To be fair this version is wearing a different&nbsp;cape compared to the one who shares the print and detail in Attack on Weathertop. Plus he's a brilliantly designed Mini-Fig for detail, the double-sided torso looks great and the short cape is a nice addition. He comes with the One Ring of course (and you're really going to have loads of these by the time you've gotten all the sets from LotR and Hobbit) and Sting. He's got a double-sided facial print too, with an ordinary expression and that wierd, funky looking bug-eyed expression showing the white irises and glowing blue whites of the eye that LEGO chose for when Frodo is wearing the ring. (Or feeling the effects of Shelob's paralyzing poison I suppose.)</p>
<p>There is also Sam, who is not given his frying pan or any other utensils of cookery, in fact he's only wielding the Phial Galadriel gave Frodo to light the darkness and Sting as well. (The set includes two, one for each Hobbit.) Sam's facial print has been re-used in 2013 for the A-Wing Pilot from LEGO Star Wars A-Wing Starfighter set, he's got a pretty good print I suppose. It works for Sam. His torso looks great though and he also comes with a small cape, the Elven Cloaks each Hobbit Wore were the first to use the shorter cape design from LEGO.</p>
<p>All in all these three Mini-Figures are great for this set, it's the only way to get two out of them and even Frodo has a different cape than the one in Weathertop.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set builds a creature from Lord of the Rings, it uses two numbered bags. One for the legs and torso the other for the Thorax and thread wrapping play feature. There's also a minor build with a Mini-Fig launching catapult for a play feature.</p>
<p>Honestly I dig this build, it's got a lot of intricate moving parts and it can support its own weight while being built, as well as afterwards. It looks menacing, large and dangerous and as you build it you get to see it take shape. There are naturally some repetitive steps where the legs are concerned, since all 8 of them pretty much share identical builds. Still it's not that bad, as the repetitious nature doesn't last very long.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Shelob is brilliant. She's a menace to Mini-Figures in any size, even the Hulk would be hard pressed to deal with her... Well if he doesn't just knock her out with one punch, I mean this is the Hulk we're talking about.</p>
<p>The scale of the model is a vast improvement over LEGO's earlier attempts at building spiders, from the Harry Potter Theme the Acromantula Aragog was just awful, early design attempts to make large spiders and Aragog's second attempt in 2010 was a sheer joke. LEGO should have gone back to the drawing board on that one.</p>
<p>Shelob works so much better if you had both spiders in your collection you'd want to re-build Aragog using techniques found in Shelob. She reminds me more of how they built the crustaceans in the Atlantis theme, she balances well, can support her own weight. Doesn't use LEGO Ninja Swords for legs and features a lot of detail work for a brick built creature. The thorax section alone works wonders and evokes a spider, the gimmic of the thread used for spider silk to wrap up Mini-Figures isn't intrusive at all, it's hidden quite nicely and works great as a play feature.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a great set, hard to come by these days, so snatch it up if you don't already own it. Unless they decide to include him in any future LotR sets this is the only way to get Sam. My one complaint is that all four Hobbits use the exact same hair piece just in different colours, something that doesn't bother me from a logical stand point of understanding the costs for sculpting unique hair styles for all four different Hobbits, and yet something that can be a slight bother when you put them all together and remember how different Merry and Pippins hair looked compared to Sam or Frodo's.</p>
<p>Still the best part of this set is Shelob herself, I think she works much better at portraying a giant spider next to the earlier attempts by LEGO's Harry Potter design team. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,3,4
"CapnRex101","2012-07-31T18:50:21.967Z","9470 - Shelob Attacks","<p>This is one of my favourite scenes from the whole of the third&nbsp;instalment&nbsp;of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Return of the King, and to see it in Lego form is fantastic. The set absolutely lives up to the movie and includes just about everything one might need to recreate the scene. There are two totally exclusive Minifigures, both of which are incredible, and the Frodo figure too is wonderful. Like many Lord of the Rings sets though, not only are the figures sublime, but the actual models are as well, which is not a common situation in some themes I have found. Anyway, on with the review...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box artwork is very attractive here and features Shelob under attack by Samwise Gamgee following Frodo's encounter with this monster. Frodo is lying on the ground having been ensnared by Shelob's web. Gollum is watching gleefully from the shadows of a small cave and the entire scene is shown on a rocky background, which is obviously the inside of Shelob's lair. The steps leading in to Mordor are visible and there are a couple of shafts of light illuminating the cavern. In the bottom corner of the cover is a gallery shot of the three Minifigures included and the Lord of the Rings logo can be seen at the top of the box next to a picture of the One Ring on the evil Sauron's finger. The back of the box has a selection of shots of the various features in this set including Shelob's&nbsp;extendible&nbsp;web and the Gollum flinger. Behind these images is a faint map of Middle Earth which is nice and makes the box a little less monochromatic.</p><p>I found no mistakes in the instructions and had no missing pieces. The single booklet&nbsp;shares the same image on it as on the box and at the back are some advertisements for a few other sets and a lovely image of all of the Lord of the Rings Minifigures in action just like in the other instruction manuals.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some good parts included in this set including many click hinge pieces which are used to articulate Shelob's legs and can be useful for your own creations. There are also a few nice rock pieces which allow you to create any kind of small rock wall and of course the wonderful printed piece which forms the spider's eyes. The brand new hair mould used for the Hobbits is included in two different colours and we get Frodo's sting weapon as well as a spare. Another thing you get spares of is the One Ring of Power which is a nice piece and can actually be used to connect two studs facing in opposite directions, however in chrome gold it looks a little strange if you intend to use it for something like that. There are two short grey capes which are wonderful and finally, the brand new Gollum torso and head piece which is not useful really (unless you are able to find an extremely creative use for it) but is absolutely excellent nevertheless. His arms are new pieces as well which may be more useful for MOCs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I will begin with the heroes of this set, and the main character of the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, <b>Frodo Baggins</b>. His hair piece is a brand new mould and is cast in dark brown with plenty of textured detailing which perfectly captures the hair style in the movie. This part is used for every Hobbit released so far and is ideal for every one of them. His head is printed with two faces, the first of which has brown eyebrows and a serious expression. What is astonishing about this printing is how much like Elijah Wood it looks and how it conveys his concern at dragging his friends in to this dangerous quest along with him. There are some wrinkles around his eyes where the One Ring of Power has evidently put strain on him by this late stage in the journey. On the reverse side of the head is a face to be used when Frodo has been stabbed and tied up by Shelob which has wide, blank eyes and an open mouth due to his shock at being wounded and it is perfect for his petrified appearance once he has been wrapped up by Shelob. He wears a dark grey short cape which is very nice indeed and is&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;to this set currently, although Sam also wears it here as well as Frodo.</p><p>The torso is printed very accurately indeed with a brown jacket which has some creases and pockets on it. Beneath this he is wearing a dark red waistcoat which is buttoned up and under that is a white shirt with an open collar. On the back of the torso are some more creases and a strap for drawing up the jacket to fit more comfortably which is present on the garment in the film. His arms are brown like the jacket and his hands are flesh coloured. The short legs are cast in dark brown and, being short, cannot be posed. They are left unprinted like all short legs that I am aware of. Frodo carries to accessories, the One Ring which is a brand new mould, it is chrome gold in colour as one would expect and is an ideal representation of the Ring of Power and can either be held in the grip of the Minifigure's hand, or placed on top. You also get two spares of this piece. He also carries a sting weapon which is a new mould and looks very accurate to the film weapon, it is cast in dark grey and a spare of this piece is included as well.</p><p>Next up is <b>Samwise Gamgee</b>, Frodo's faithful companion throughout his journey and in my opinion, the real hero of the trilogy. His Minifigure is superb featuring the same hair piece as Frodo, albeit in a different colour. The light orange hair has the same excellent texture as Frodo's hair and is totally exclusive to this figure, suiting him perfectly. The face, just like Frodo's, is very accurate to the actor Sean Astin who plays him in the films. It features a serious expression on one side with orange eyebrows to match his hair colour and on the other side Sam's expression is one of terror, with wrinkles around his eyes and a mouth with his teeth gritted in fear. The short cape he wears is dark grey just like Frodo's, and just like what he wears in the movies.</p><p>His torso features even more detailed printing than Frodo with a dark tan crumpled shirt with some brown buttons and an open collar. He is wearing brown braces and has a strap coming across his chest and a buckled belt which is lovely. On the back of the torso is some more of his shirt, a continuation of the strap around his chest, and the rest of his braces as well as the belt. The arms are dark tan and his hands are flesh. Like Frodo his legs are short and dark brown with no printing. Also like Frodo Baggins, Sam carries two items with him, a dark grey&nbsp;Gladius&nbsp;style blade which is nice, and a&nbsp;diamond&nbsp;piece which acts as the Phial of Galadriel. This is a light source given to Sam by Frodo at the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of this scene which he uses in his battle against Shelob.</p><p>The final Minifigure included is the wonderful <b>Gollum</b>. This is not your average figure at all as it is made entirely from new parts and he looks amazing. His head, torso, and legs are all made from one piece which is cast so he can stand on a studded surface and there is also a stud on his back so if you wish, you may attach something on there. He has a brown rag printed around his waist just like he wears in the film. On his head is most of the printing though, including his withered hair, wide blue eyes, and a cackling smile with his pointed teeth visible. There are lots of wrinkles on his forehead as well and his tiny nostrils. The shoulders are the only point of articulation on this figure and they are entirely separate pieces. They are quite similar to Battle Droid arms from the Star Wars theme, but are fleshed out a little bit. The shape of the piece allows Gollum to hold items vertically and not horizontally. He comes with one accessory to hold, a silver fish, which this character is often seen with during his appearances so this is a welcome inclusion. Gollum is of course a key character and I am delighted with how he has been recreated in Lego.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly short, under half an hour, and is in fact, not all that interesting. The construction of the legs is repetitive but there is no way to avoid this when you are making a creature like a spider of course! The way in which Shelob's body has been created is quite nice and creates an effective shell shape for it. Probably the best bit of the construction phase however would be the formation of the web storage area in Shelob's abdomen. This manages to hold an awful lot of white string in a small space and although no interesting building techniques are utilised to do this, it is nevertheless something to think about if you ever require string to be used in your own model.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>There are two sections of this set. The smaller of these is the tiny cave area which features the cave entrance with some foliage around it, and a catapult for Gollum to be launched from to attack the helpless Hobbits. He can in fact be fired a fair distance, almost too far actually as he usually&nbsp;overshoots&nbsp;the heroic pair unless they are standing about two feet away from the launcher! However, this is still a fun feature, and it adds a bit more playability to the set.</p><p>The main portion of the model however is the monstrous spider, Shelob! She attacks the Hobbits when they wander in to her lair, not knowing that Gollum is leading them in to a trap. Her eight legs are all poseable to quite an extent as is her abdomen section. The mandibles around her gaping jaws can be moved in and out just below the printed brick which has her eyes on it, just like in the film, one of these eyes is stabbed out which shows amazing attention to detail on the part of the designer. The main feature however is the awesome extendible web which is in fact a white string piece. This can extend to a distance of just over a metre, which is astonishing if you ask me and it really allows you to wrap up Frodo like in the movie. The spider can hang from this string as it is quite strong and there is a red hook on the other end.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is by far the best spider ever made by Lego and there have been a few, most notably Aragog in the Harry Potter theme, which has been created twice, but never as well as Shelob here! The set as a whole is excellent and, although it is not the best set of this Lord of the Rings theme in my opinion, it is very good indeed and should not be passed up on. Get it while you can would be my advice as I suspect these models will be selling very well indeed!</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

You get 2 rare minifigs, Samwise and Gollum, and you get the Ring... the Ring that's Gollum's precioussss.... </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>The set is well designed. Shelob is creepy and the eye printing really freaks me out. Not kidding. </li><li>The ring. I got 2 extras! </li><li>The minifigures. Gollum is outSTANDING, although I would've expected him to be grayer and have more hair. Oh well, win some, lose some. Frodo is like a tiny Elijah Wood, complete with oversized ring and detailed new mold of his sword Sting. And Samwise looks almost like Bilbo! </li><li>The catapult function. It works pretty well, although for most of the time Frodo is still standing while Gollum sits lying on his side. </li></ul><p><strong>Cons: </strong></p><ul><li>The building of Shelob's legs is RE PE TI TIVE. It's so annoying to build one leg after another. </li><li>There's a hook sticking out of Shelob's butt. </li><li>The string doesn't wrap around Frodo fully. Sometimes it even gets tangled. </li><li>The cave is tiny. The only one who can actually fit through it is Gollum, who sits there eating fish and watching an innocent Hobbit get poisoned. Meanwhile, the Hobbits can't even get into the cave to fight Shelob, so it's a big mystery as to how they even got in. Maybe they used the catapult?</li><li>Like said previously, the catapult doesn't always knock down its target, and it's pretty flimsy. </li><li>Again, Shelob's missing eye (and the rest of her eyes). Still freaking me out. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this set is brilliant. My only problems are the size of the cave, the catapult, and the repetitive design of Shelob.

"lkb57","2014-02-04T19:57:05.41Z","A Must Buy for any LOTR Fan","<p>Depicting one of the greatest scenes from the entire LOTR trilogy, the Shelob Attacks! set let&#39;s you recreate the famous battle between Sam and the huge spider Shelob. One of my favorite things about this set is that TLC decided to make a brick-built Shelob instead of some large, molded monster. The finished spider looks fantastic and is the perfect scale for doing battle with the hobbit minifigs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For me, the highlight of the set was Shelob&#39;s printed face. It&#39;s a great addition, accurately captures the monster&#39;s features, and will be a useful addition to lots of creature/monster MOCs. The set also includes the One Ring, and Frodo&#39;s sword Sting (just like in the book and film, in the picture of the set, Sam is holding it). Also, the use of a white jewel piece as the Phial of Galadriel&nbsp;was a genius move. One of the greatest things about this set is that nearly all of the pieces used to build Shelob will be useful for building other Lego creatures: lot&#39;s of joints, fangs, claws, and slopes/rounded pieces. For these more exotic pieces alone the set is worth the money</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes three minifigures: Sam, Gollum, and Frodo. Both Sam and Frodo have reversible faces: Sam has an angry face and a serious face; Frodo has a neutral face and a frightened/poisoned face that depicts him after he&#39;s been stung by Shelob. The minifigure Gollum is excellent, aside from the fact that his arms tend to detach too easily from his torso.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building Shelob&#39;s legs gets a little repetitive, but the design of the inner workings in the spider&#39;s abdomen that allow its &quot;web&quot; to pull in and out are clever enough to make up for it. All in all, it&#39;s not an incredibly exciting build, but the finished model is so fun that it really didn&#39;t make a difference to me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fantastic set, and a must for LOTR/Hobbit enthusiasts. It&#39;s been on sale for quite cheap on Amazon lately, but even if you pay full price, it&#39;s definitely worth it. Grab it while you can!</p>

"Mr_Malfoy","2012-12-15T22:10:56.127Z","""Let him go, you filth.""","<p>I said this in my last Lord of the Rings review, and I'll say it again: <strong>The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit theme is the best licensed theme since LEGO Star Wars hit the shelves way</strong> <strong>back in 1999.</strong> This is the second smallest set from The Lord of the Rings theme (minus the <nobr><a id=""FALINK_1_0_0"" class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?set=9469-1#""><font color=""#1c7dff"">polybags</font></a></nobr> and the key chains). The set focuses on a scene from the third film, The Return of the King (although in Tolkien's trilogy, this scene occured in The Two Towers), in which Gollum has led Frodo to Shelob's Lair and the pass of Cirith Ungol, straight into a trap, but Sam races to the rescue. This set is absolutely fantastic, featuring three main characters (Frodo, Sam, and Gollum) and the best brick-built animal ever. This set is a must-buy. Read on to find out why.</p><p><strong>MINIFIGURES:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Frodo Baggins</strong> - In this set, Frodo is dressed in his traveling clothes and the Elvish cloak he received from Galadriel in Lothlórien. His face has an uncanny resemblance to Elijah Wood. He has the same two-sided face from Attack on Weathertop: one side is grim and the other side is unconscious/wounded/poisoned. He comes with Sting and ""the precious...""</p><p>2. <strong>Samwise Gamgee</strong> - In this set (and only in this set, at the moment), he wears his traveling clothes and the Elvish cloak he received in Lothlórien from Galadriel. He also resembles the original actor (Sean Astin). He carries a short sword and the flask that contains the Light of Eärendil. He also has a two-sided face: one grim/stern, and one scared/nervous.</p><p>3. <strong>Gollum </strong>- Brilliant. Fantastic. Perfect. Gollum wins hands-down for best immobile minifigure ever. He has two wide eyes and an evil scream showing all his point teeth. He has printing to represent his stringy hair and he has his ears. Trust me, this is one minifigure you don't want to see in the middle of the night. He comes with a fish: his signature accessory.</p><p><strong>PARTS </strong>- The set includes several useful parts: Hobbit hair in dark brown and dull orange, Sting, a short sword, a fish, the One Ring (actually, I got three of them), Shelob's printed eyes piece, and a diamond.</p><p><strong>BUILD </strong>- An enjoyable build, with the exception of having to build eight legs, and the string neede for Shelob's web (I have chunky fingers, so I don't do string). First you build the little cave entrance with the minifgure flipper, then you build Shelob herself.</p><p><strong>FINISHED MODEL </strong>- The cave entrance provides a little something extra, but Shelob is the main focus of this set. She is without a doubt, the best brick-built animal ever created by LEGO. My verdict -</p><p><strong>10/10</strong></p><p><strong>BUY THIS SET</strong></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Telcontar","2013-01-12T19:29:22.57Z","Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!","<p>Those were the words Frodo spoke when he pulled out the Light of Earendil and beheld&nbsp;the eyes of&nbsp;Shelob,&nbsp;Last Child of Ungoliant,&nbsp;the most&nbsp;terrifying spider of Middle-earth, and LEGO.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>On the front of the box it shows the dramatic scene from the movie when Sam is coming to rescue Frodo from Shelob.&nbsp; The picture clearly demonstrates what's happening and shows off the spider.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For part we get a lot of dark, earth colors.&nbsp; Lots of brown, black, and grey, but the inner workings of Shelob are actually multicolored mainly consisting of red and blue.&nbsp; For the little bit of cave we get some slopes which are always useful.&nbsp; For accesories we get Sting and three&nbsp;<em>One </em>Rings of Power, which kind of defeats the&nbsp;<em>One </em>but I'm glad there are extras because they would/are&nbsp;pretty easy to loose.&nbsp; Plus, if you get enough sets you would have enough for the&nbsp;other&nbsp;Rings (3 Elvish, 7 for Dwarves,&nbsp;&amp; 9 for&nbsp;Men).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Frodo: In this set Frodo is nearly identical to the one in Attack of Weathertop except for his cape.&nbsp; In Weathertop he had a dark green one but here he has a grey one to match Sam.&nbsp; One one side of his head we have his ""tired"" expression and on the other we have his ""I've just been stabbed by a giant, poisonous, spider"" look.&nbsp; </p><p>Sam:&nbsp; Sam is exclusive to this set and one of my favorites.&nbsp; His torso is nicely printed to be accurate to the movie.  His face is also double-sided.  One side is his ""neutral"" maybe slightly ""tired/grouchy"" expression and the other is his ""fighting"" face.</p><p>Gollum:&nbsp; Gollum (if you can call him a minifigure!) is also unique to this set.  He is accurately sized to look right beside the hobbits.  On his printed face we can definitely see the Gollum coming out more than the Smeagol.&nbsp; On the back of his head is also printed some hair.  His arms are attached on to the side of his body and can move up and down.  </p><p>For stop-motion people: He looks good just sitting there but he's incredibly hard to animate!</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The cave part of the model is simple and goes by pretty quickly.  Then comes the spider.  Each step she gets more and more life-like.  The only part that was a bit boring was when I built the legs.&nbsp; There was quite a bit of repetitive building (but what would you expect?).  Often times using string can be difficult but here it wasn't (except for tying it onto&nbsp;the pieces on the end).</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished Shelob looks more like a spider than any LEGO set ever before.  At least my mom thought so.&nbsp; :-)  The string function&nbsp;works very well and the legs are extremely pose-able which adds a lot more character&nbsp;when setting up different scenes.&nbsp;&nbsp;People have complained that Gollum's catapult didn't work right but I thought just the opposite.  It seemed to work great plus it was fun having Gollum leap at&nbsp;the hobbits.  Another neat thing about this set is that&nbsp;it isn't overpriced which is&nbsp;somewhat surprising considering that this is a licensed theme!  So thank-you LEGO!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This may be the best set of the LotR theme.&nbsp; The model is fantastic and includes tons of playability for a very reasonable price.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other contender for top place in this theme is Helm's Deep.&nbsp; Overall this a&nbsp;10/10 set, except for your arachnophobic friend. ;-)&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took around 20 minutes, and had many repetitive&nbsp;steps on the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The two main features of this set are the web that can be released&nbsp;from Shelob, and Gollum&#39;s catapult.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good set, but the cave section could be improved apon.</p>

"Tediousity","2017-01-29T02:27:23.66Z","Mr. Frodo!","<p>This is a nice set I received for my birthday several years ago, and I was shocked to realize it was that cheap!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s a fish for Gollum as well as the string/web, Ring, phial of Galadrial, and Shelob&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>Frodo is in his usual attire but this time with a gray elven-cloak and a two-sided face: neutral and paralyzed. He has the Ring.</p>

<p>Sam is unique to this set (!) and has a nicely printed satchel as well as his elven-cloak. He&#39;s holding Sting and the phial of Galadrial, here an upside-down white jewel, which works quite well in my opinion.</p>

<p>Gollum is a unique mold with immovable legs and two arm pieces, both new molds. Here he has wide eyes, whereas in the other sets he&#39;s in (Dimensions and Hobbit) he has narrow. He comes with an ordinary fish.</p>

<p><strong>Final Product</strong></p>

<p>Shelob looks quite good when finished, in my opinion. The small cave section is good too. Shelob is posable nicely and the web-spinning feature works fine. Gollum is a nice addition to provide a secondary antagonist to the set. My only problem with it is that it would&#39;ve been nice to have a larger cave. But as it is, this set is great! It&#39;s also giant for $20.</p>

Plus I&#39;ve recently decided that since the LOTR&nbsp;theme is so small, it seems possible to complete it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All I can say, if you are debating between either of the two spider sets, go with this one. The build of Shelob is immensely superior to that of the Mirkwood&nbsp;spiders, and she is much more larger and menacing. Not to mention this is the only place where you can get Sam (which is surprisingly given how important he is).&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>So the star of this set is clearly Sam, you can&#39;t get him anywhere else and he does look great. Frodo and Gollum are unique minifigures but not all that different from their countless other minifigures&nbsp;you probably already own. Perhaps another orc or two would have been nice, but 3 minifigures seems perfectly acceptable for a set of this size.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There are definitely some very unique parts here, mainly the two large bricks that make up the top and bottom of the thorax. Beyond that, you get a boat load of hinges and a lot of fangs, plus some dark green seaweed. You also get a handful of gray roof slopes which are great for building mountains.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>It is no doubt an interesting build as it creates a handful of odd angles and it is very cool how it hides the string for the web. However, unlike most other LOTR sets, it does have quite a bit of repetition in the 8 identical legs, but I suppose I can forgive Lego for this, after all, there is only so much you can do with the thin legs of a spider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a small set, so the build doesn&#39;t take too long, but it is enjoyable and rewarding. Probably the most brilliant piece of it is how it conceals the string but does so in a way that allows it to windup perfectly onto the spool.</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>Shelob looks fantastic and amazingly her very thin legs are capable of supporting her and balancing her. Her immense size in comparison to the minifigures&nbsp;is excellent, much scarier than the Mirkwood spiders. She also is completely poseable. Each leg is composed of 3 hinges, you have two pincers that move on a horizontal plane, and a thorax that can be elevated and rotated.</p>

<p>Then of course you have the web with a hook on the end. Rolling it in or out works great, but it does help if you can put a little weight on the end of the hook. Of course you can&#39;t detach it from Shelob&nbsp;(at least not without disassembling her), so Frodo can&#39;t get wrapped up and then removed. I wish they included one of the web bags that is included with Mirkwood&nbsp;spiders as they are much more practical as a play piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, you have the cave entrance. Unfortunately this mini build is a total waste. The entire build stands on a 2x10 plate which means it tips over way too easily. The catapult for launching Gollum simply knocks the whole build over. I&#39;m rather surprised that they put in so much detail into this build, but made it so small that a hobbit can&#39;t fit into the entrance standing, and it is so thin that it can&#39;t easily be played with without falling down. I understand making it larger would increase the price of the set, but this thing is just absurd and couldn&#39;t even be displayed. Perhaps it&#39;s best use is to use the parts to make Riddle for the Ring larger.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I do highly recommend this set. It is a lot of fun for a low price. Of course since you need to have a Sam minifigure, it just doesn&#39;t make sense to purchase him without just getting the whole set for a few bucks more. As I&#39;ve said in reviews of other LOTR sets, these small sets are incredibly complex, enjoyable, and in the case of this one much larger than you would expect from a set of this size.&nbsp;</p>
