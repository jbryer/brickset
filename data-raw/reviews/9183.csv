"Peregrine","2012-05-26T08:19:01.453Z","Very nice set that can really make large battles possible when used with other sets","<p>The Uruk-Hai Army set is part of a larger battle scene, consisting of a defensive wall that can be connected to other walls (like those in the Helm's Deep set) and a Uruk-Hai giant crossbow.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I found this set easy to put together even though I am just getting started in the hobby. The instructions were clear. The box is very sturdy and can be opened by just cutting two pieces of tape holding it together so the box is not damaged.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The set has two main parts - the defensive wall and the giant crossbow on wheels - I feel the crossbow seems a little too large, out of scale with the wall but that's my only complaint.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are six minifigures in the set - three Uruk-Hai warriors in heavy armor and with polearms or sword and shield, one Uruk-Hai leader with no armor and sword and shield. All of these have the option of two types of face paint for their heads but only the leaders is really visible because of helmets.</p><p>There are two ""good guys"" as well - an Eomer figure as well as a generic Rohan soldier. Both of these have excellent printing on their chests, the soldier has a bow and quiver and a plain helmet, Eomer has a gold helmet (nice!) and green cloak, with a spear and shield. He has a horse, which is quite well done, since the back legs and head move you can pose him in a rearing position or just the normal walking/running one. The horse's harness piece also has room to keep a spare sword handy.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Pretty easy build - I made a few mistakes, mostly with the bricks that are made to look like stones in a wall - for me it was easy to turn those around so they faced the wrong way, but it wasn't very noticeable. The defensive wall has pins at the sides so you can connect another wall model - I bought two of this set and connected both walls together for a nice effect.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I am very happy with it. The wall has stairs behind it for soldiers to access the top level, and it has a small catapult with barrels (of boiling oil I guess) to throw at enemies. The rolling Uruk-Hai crossbow has bow arms that can be manipulated and two hooked bolts that can be fired by flicking a piece forward. Since I have a second set, I think two crossbows would be unncessary so I believe the set could be used to easily make a wheeled vehicle like a battering ram or similar.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I am very happy with this set and once my Helm's Deep set arrives I will be glad to use this to extend the larger battle.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"ezra1232","2012-05-27T14:05:08.44Z","Army builder!","<p>About $30 and 6 minifigures, wow! This set features a lot of nice minifigures (which is probably why most people would get this set) but it also is a nice rounded set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions </h4><p>The box is not oversized, and the instructions are easy to follow (there isn't too many building challanges).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is some new brick facade pieces, and there is one of the new articulated horses! There is some nice weoponry and rare blades on the siege weopon.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Urak-Hai: There is two standard ones with a new helmet, armor, and a spike. The faces are great and you can see the eyes through the helmet. There is one&nbsp;Urak-Hai with the same helmet, but no chestplate, he does have a shield and he has a new sword. The fourth Urak-Hai has hair and a shield and a new sword. </p><p>Eomer: He has a very nice helmet, a great smooth green shield, a new sword, and a spike, his body printing is superb and his face looks great.</p><p>The soilder has the same helmet as Eomer but it is just solid grey, he is armed with a bow-and-arrow</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Both structures are easily built, but they look nice.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks great.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is a great army builder, and the it is the right ratio of bad to good for this&nbsp;battle in the movie (the urak-hai outnumbered the Rohan soilders). The castle can be attached to helm's deep and more castles. This is one of the best sets for LotR.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-10T12:04:22.56Z","Highly Expensive Battle Pack","<p>Set #9471 Uruk-Hai Army: This marks my first official LEGO Lord of the Rings boxed set, everything else I've currently picked up is polybagged related. I chose this set as my first for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) Spending 30$ or more on LotR sets at TRU this past weekend allowed you to get a free Uruk with Ballista Polybag. And this set alone met the necessary spend requirements.</p>
<p>2) It is a great set for fans of army building and castle themes.</p>
<p>The price of this set from TRU was 41.99$ which is 2$ over the MSRP in Canada, not that big of a mark-up compared to other, more expensive or even some smaller sets. (I refuse to pay 17.99$ for Gandalf Arrives no matter what TRU thinks, that is not a set that should be getting marked up.) The piece count is 257, there are a good number of new pieces in this set too that I have never owned before, among them the new wall pieces with the textured look and some great looking curved pieces.</p>
<p>Each model comes in its own numbered bag, there are very few sets which I have purchased that feature the numbered bag approach, I can literally count them on one hand. The first model is the massive Uruk Ballista or is it a Trebuche? I'm not quite familiar with names for medieval style assault weapons. It stands about as tall as this small section of wall, making it a bit of an overkill situation for the poor Rohan Soldier defending the battlements.</p>
<p>Two flick-fire missiles are used to great effect, instead of flicking them with your finger you build a launching mechanism which slides forward to push the missiles out. It took me a few tries, but they do fire fairly far when you get the momentum down right. It rolls well on four plate-built wheels. And you get three printed tile pieces with wood patterns on them as part of the build, all in all an impressive little model.</p>
<p>Bag number two features an extension piece for Helm's Deep (a set which I may not own for a considerable length of time sadly.), the wall is built quite solidly for such a low to the ground defensive piece, it features a small catapult which can be placed on the wall or elsewhere depending on preference and play pattern. There's a single stair piece going up one side, and the lower section features an open slot where an archer can stand to fire arrows into the crowd.</p>
<p>The build of the secondary model is modular as well, I see no problems with building the set backwards from what the instructions intended and reverse the look of it, in other words you could buy two of this set and instead of having the exact same wall with the exact same placement of features you could instead mirror the build quite easily and have two sides of the same expansion to the Helm's Deep set. I hope that came out as clear as I intended.</p>
<p>The set is pretty one sided though, I mean it isn't called Uruk-Hai Army for nothing, you have a total of four Uruks, three with helmets one with Lurtz style hair, and a single Rohan Soldier to defend the battlements. Plus Eomer with his Horse.</p>
<p>Ah yes, the new LEGO Horse, capable of rearing up on two legs. I love that LEGO has made this new piece, I just wish they'd make it in black and white as well as the brown with white markings that seems to be found in every single LotR set to date with a horse as well as a few other sets using the new piece. It's a really great update for the Horse piece though, army building this animal alone would be costly if it weren't for such sets as Gandalf Arrives.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figs are all great looking. The Uruk all look identical when it comes to torso printing and leg printing, they have back printing on their torsos and double sided heads, one side is unadorned while the other is painted with the white hand of Saruman, so you can mix up your little army of LEGO Uruks quite nicely with an even number of marked and un-marked faces. The armor is standard LEGO fare, in a new color, and the Uruks' unique helmet pieces look great, very true to the films. The sword and shield pieces are awesome looking new accessories from LEGO, while the axe that the other two are wielding is your standard Castle Axe, still quite menacing though in the hands of a snarling Uruk.</p>
<p>Both members of Rohan look different, the archer features a double-sided torso with chainmail and leather armor combined, there is no leg printing, but he does have a double-sided head both expressions are similar, determined looking faces, one side just has the teeth gritted and showing while the other is close mouthed. The bow and quiver are standard from Castle sets, but the helmet is new with its own Rohan look to it, there's the horselord's symbol sort of molded onto the top. All together it's just a fun looking new piece.</p>
<p>Eomer stands out more, he has chest armor detailing in his torso print, a double-sided torso though the back print is covered up by his great new green cape. He's got leg printing with protective armor, he's carrying a round Rohan shield in a rich maroon colored plastic painted green and gold on the front, he's using the spear piece first introduced with CMF Historical Mini-Figures, and he also includes one of the new LotR Sword pieces which clips onto the horse's gray saddle. His head is also double-sided, two similar prints, one open mouthed yelling as he charges down upon the invading Uruks, the other close mouthed determination.</p>
<p>Eomer's helmet got the lions share of detail work, while the Rohan solder is plain gray, Eomer's has printed detailing with the symbols of Rohan in gold on either side, the molded horse head top is also painted gold. It came in its own bag, so I'm not sure if this is chinese made or not. The back of the helmet has also a bit of brown for added color.</p>
<p>Overall I'm extremely impressed by this small set, it is a bit on the pricey side to work as an honest Battle Pack, and I couldn't recommend buying more than at least two of these to expand your Uruk army and Helm's Deep, however what is here is great. A lot of unique pieces, great printing on the Mini-Figs, awesome looking screen accurate accessories, a brand new color for the cape. I think we've only seen this color maybe with the CMF S3 Elf, so it's not as common as black or brown capes. And the modular nature of the wall piece means it can fit in quite nicely with Helm's Deep, or if you haven't the funds just yet and bought two of this set you could combine both walls into something a bit bigger until Helm's Deep arrives.</p>
<p>This is what I'd like to see more of from futurue LEGO LotR sets, if they begin to include honest Battle Packs in the next year or so I'd like to see a Rohan Soldier's Battle Pack with perhaps four Rohan/Rohirrim with assorted weapons and such to bulk up your existing Helm's Deep sets, perhaps with an additional small wall build that could attach to Helm's Deep. And I'd like to see more Uruk, don't mix and match the Battle Packs like with Star Wars, just make boxed Battle Packs dedicated to one side or the other, like Star Wars used to do.</p>
<p>It's pricey, but try to grab two and when you can pick up Helm's Deep you won't be sorry.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"CapnRex101","2012-08-18T17:48:45.27Z","9471 - Uruk-Hai Army","<p>In my opinion this is one of the best Lord of the Rings sets among this first wave for many reasons, not only are the Minifigures all absolutely brilliant, but the actual models too are wonderful and there are plenty of fun features and playability here. This set can be connected to set 9474, The Battle of Helm's Deep, which only adds to the playability. As a parts pack this set is fantastic as well as it includes numerous rare or even exclusive pieces, and you get just about all you might need to make any small medieval MOC.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The square box is printed with some lovely artwork in which the wall section included is under attack by the terrifying Uruk-Hai while Eomer and his Rohan Soldier desperately endeavour to defend it. The catapult found on top of the wall has launched a rock at the Uruk-Hai ballista which is returning fire at the soldier standing atop the ramparts. The background is very dark and rocky just like Helm's Deep in the film and it is raining heavily which adds to the chaotic atmosphere of the scene. In the bottom left hand corner of the box is a gallery shot of the six Minifigures and along the top is the Lego Lord of the Rings logo and the One Ring on Sauron's finger.</p><p>The back of the box has several images displaying the features of the set and a selection of the accessories are displayed including Eomer's helmet and shield, as well as some of the Uruk-Hai equipment. At the bottom of the box is an image showing how the set can be connected to set 9474, The Battle of Helm's Deep to extend that model and create a bigger battle. All of these images are on a background which shows a map of Middle Earth.</p><p>The instructions are very nice indeed. There is one booklet with some advertisements at the end of other sets and the upcoming game. One thing I have noticed however is that, like set 9496, Desert Skiff, the cover of the instruction booklet seems to be made of a very high quality glossy paper which is nice and makes it less liable to tear or crinkle so it can more easily be kept in mint condition in the box prior to purchase.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a huge number of wonderful parts included in this set as I mentioned earlier in the review. These include five light grey masonry bricks, three printed wooden tiles which are lovely, and a pearl gold flag piece which I like very much.</p><p>We also get one of the brand new horses in brown which is lovely and of course plenty of new accessories. These include two of the Uruk-Hai swords and shields, three Uruk-Hai helmets, and two of the new Rohan helmets, one of which is printed with a a great deal of detail. Best of all in my opinion however is the absolutely wonderful dark green shield which is printed with some metallic gold patterning and looks superb.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>For me the Minifigures are the real highlight of this model as one would expect with a battle pack style set and I will begin with the heroes, the first of which is <b>Eomer</b>, King Theoden's nephew. This Minifigure is&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;to the set and is magnificent in my opinion. His helmet is cast in pearl light grey and is cast with lots of detail, as well as having some gold highlights printed on the helmet which are fantastic. It has a nose guard and a tall crest on it, as well as some brown padding at the back which I like. All in all, a superb component for this wonderful Minifigure and one which is extremely accurate to the films. Eomer's head too is&nbsp;brand&nbsp;new and is printed with two faces. He has a dark tan beard and eyebrows, as well as a few wrinkles which show he has had a hard life in battle. On one side he has a fairly neutral expression, and on the other, a wide open mouth which expresses his anger and determination as he rides in to battle to defend Helm's Deep. He wears a simple dark green cape which is very nice indeed, the fabric used to make these new capes seems to be a little thinner than what was used before but it still looks marvellous and matches his shield very nicely.</p><p>His torso is printed on both the front and back with some silver chain-mail armour and a dark red tunic with some metallic silver flower patterning on it. He wears a brown belt around his waist with a golden buckle too just like in the film. On the back this belt is continued with some pockets and lots of detail, as well as the rest of his chain-mail armour. The tunic is also continued and there are some silver patterns on the back of the torso, similar to the ones on the front. His arms are dark grey and his hands are flesh in colour. The hips and legs are printed as well with some more fabric of the tunic on his dark grey hips, and on the legs are two strips of chain-mail which run down from the top of the torso to just below the knee as well as some long dark red ribbons which hang from his belt. He comes with three accessories, a brown and pearl grey spear which also came with the Spartan from Series 2 of the Collectable Minifigures. His shield is my favourite piece however, it is cast in dark red inexplicably as it is almost entirely printed in dark green on the front of the shield, along with some golden patterns just like what is on his shield in the movies! A pearl grey sword is also included as an alternative for his spear.</p><p>The next figure included is the <b>Rohan Soldier</b> which is also wonderful. He wears the same helmet as Eomer, but his is left unprinted. Nevertheless, there is so much moulded detail here it stills looks amazing in my view. His head is excellent and is printed with two different expressions, like that of Eomer. He has a ginger beard and eyebrows which look lovely and on one face he has a determined expression with a closed mouth. However, I prefer the alternative face which has the same eyebrows and beard, but his teeth are gritted here showing his anger. There are also a few more wrinkles printed on this face. Around the neck of this Rohan Soldier is a brown quiver which has two arrows in it, this is an old piece, but is still brilliant in my opinion and I love it.</p><p>His torso is printed with some spectacular dark grey and metallic silver chain-mail and some leather neck and chest padding with the string to tighten it printed on it. There is also a brown strap running across his chest and a buckled belt at the bottom of the torso. All of the chain-mail, padding, straps and belt are continued on to his back but it is obscured by the quiver a great deal when he is wearing that accessory. His arms are dark green and his hands are flesh as he is not wearing gloves of course. His legs are plain dark brown with no printing and he carries a brown bow and arrow. I would have preferred the newer bow would be included rather than this one, but this is a very minor complaint.</p><p>Now, on to the evil <b>Uruk-Hai</b>. There are four of these Minifigures included, each of which can be customised to you preference using the many accessories. I will first discuss the basic figure, and then the pieces which one can use to adapt them as you wish. The head is cast in dark red and printed with two faces, one on either side of the head. On one side are two large yellow eyes, gritted teeth, and some dark tan highlights and wrinkles which look excellent. On the other side are the same eyes, but his mouth is slightly open with bared teeth and the white hand of Saruman is printed on his face which looks great. Both faces are supremely detailed and I like them both equally.</p><p>The torso is very highly detailed as well with plenty of leather padding and some metallic armour which looks fantastic. Some small studs are found on his torso and he has a large silver buckle on the belt he wears around his waist. On the back of the torso is some more of the leather garments the Uruk-Hai wear and the rest of his belt. The silver studs and buckles are also continued on the reverse of his torso. In all of the fabric and leather areas of printing there are some creases which add a bit of extra detail. His arms are dark red and the hands are dark grey. The legs and hips are printed with some more of the leather and studs which looks absolutely marvellous. However, the most prominent colour on his legs is the dark brown that the piece is cast in.</p><p>The accessories included with the set are two dark grey Uruk-Hai blades, two Uruk-Hai shields, two halberds, two pieces of pearl dark grey chest armour, and three Uruk-Hai helmets which are my favourite piece of all. A long&nbsp;black&nbsp;hair piece is included as well which is a great thing to have. The instructions suggest you have two Uruk-Hai armed with a halberd, a helmet and a chest plate. One with the&nbsp;black&nbsp;hair piece, a shield, and a sword. The&nbsp;last&nbsp;one has an Uruk-Hai sword, a shield, and a helmet. It is worth noting that a figure cannot wear chest armour and the&nbsp;black&nbsp;hair piece at the same time as the armour gets in the way so the hair does not sit properly on the head.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build takes about half an hour and is fairly simple, but there are some good techniques used here. Some SNOT is used to form the crumbling wall section and I like how some sand green bricks are interspersed with the light grey to break up the colour a bit and make it look a little bit more interesting. The use of a wall panel to form the arrow slit in the wall is ingenious and it looks outstanding. On the ballista I appreciate the way in which the wooden printed tile at the front of the vehicle is fitted at an angle which makes it look rather cobbled together just like in the film!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the construction phase is complete, the set looks amazing in my opinion. The new horse is reddish brown in colour and is printed with some reins on his head and a white patch between his eyes which looks good. The horse can rear up and is articulated at the head and the hind legs, but in a static position, the horse now looks more realistic than the older design. A dark grey saddle comes with the horse for Eomer or any of your other Minifigures to ride and two clips allow you to place some weapons here for storage.</p><p>The Uruk-Hai ballista can roll on its four wheels and fires two grappling hook tipped flick-fire missiles quite a distance if you push it correctly, approximately two feet is achievable, perhaps even further than that! The entire top section is angled to add to the range of the missiles using a Technic component which works very well and still keeps the model very sturdy indeed. Three tiles are included on the ballista which are printed with the wooden designs and they are used to good effect, really adding to the rustic appearance of the model and making it much more realistic.</p><p>The largest section to this set however is the wall section, which is wonderful. The brickwork is outstanding and uses masonry bricks, light and dark grey bricks, and some sand green to act as moss on these ancient walls. There are some rocks at the base of the wall and the entire structure is built on two dark tan plates which are suitable and match the colours used in set 9474, The Battle of Helm's Deep. On the top of the wall is a small catapult which can launch the three dark grey cylinders included at the enemy. This can easily be disconnected to be a mobile catapult, but I prefer to keep it on the wall. A dark green and golden flag is raised on a brown pole and a flaming torch is at the other end of the wall. At the back of the wall is some space to stand Minifigures and a flight of brown steps up to the ramparts. At either end of the wall are two Technic pins which allow one to attach this solidly to other sections of wall as the box suggests.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a truly excellent Lord of the Rings set and in my opinion this set gives you the most for your money. This is certainly a model which could be bought in multiples as you can build an army of both Uruk-Hai as suggested by the title and the forces of Rohan, however the price point may mean that only one or possibly two are really affordable for most. I highly recommend this set to anybody, the Minifigures are all superb, the models are all delightful, and there is lots of playability with all you need to create an exciting battle.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-06T21:10:04.717Z","""I don't know what I've been told, orcs strong but they not smart!"" ","The long-standing tradition of LEGO symbiosis (aka creative ways with which to part the consumer with his or her money) continues with the Uruk-Hai Army, and the road is surely ever-long with regards to this insidious but oh-so workable tactic. By this, I do of course mean that Uruk-Hai Army has been designed to fit in flawlessly with the Battle of Helm's Deep (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=9474-1"">9474</a>), this being the undisputed grandfather of the first wave of Lord of the Rings sets.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The symbiosis is much more explicit here, in that it is openly suggested - through art on the boxes and instructions of both sets as well as through the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=5001130-1"">combination platter</a> offered on LEGO's Shop-at-Home website - and therefore all the more convincing to the unwary and weak-willed consumer (of which I am one of). However, unlike more obvious cash-grabbing attempts (such as overpriced ""battle packs""), Uruk-Hai Army is an actual set and a pretty good one to boot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The immediate attraction here should be the Minifigs, an unusually high number for a set of this size, making it clear that this set is meant to be part of a larger framework. The scales are tipped in favour of the orcs, and you get four that are more or less generic with a couple of minor variations. All of them have identical head, torso, and leg pieces, but you get an assortment of helmets, a hairpiece, some armour, and a bunch of weapons that you can mix and match to create a little variety. This plus the Battle of Helm's Deep gives you a grand total of eight orcs, which will surely serve as a great starting point for staging a battle of your own (or for a particularly intense and well-attended diplomatic round-table discussion).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the side of men, you get Eomer, a great Minifig for a colourless character and one unique to this set. Eomer is highly detailed and looks awesome, and he can therefore be almost forgiven for being known for a grand total of perhaps two things in the movies. His partner in crime is a generic Rohan archer; ironically, though, given that he only appears in this set while Aragon, Gimli, and Frodo have multiple showings, he could actually be considered more ""unique"" than those members of the Fellowship! I do hope that more opportunities for generic soldiers are created in the future, because I think it would be nice to have a few more of them to fight alongside our heroes (though I guess it does give my Crown Knights something to do now).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set itself is split into two roughly comparable components: an orcish ballista and a section of wall. Neither of them are bad by any means, but it's clear that they're definitely meant to be part of a much larger display. Of the two, the ballista is probably much more interesting, featuring a suitably ""cobbled together"" look as befitting the orcs of Middle-Earth, and an interesting spin on the ol' flick-fire missile mechanism that works very well. Unfortunately, the ballista can change neither direction nor pitch, which means that the orcs will have to employ a fairly good knowledge of projectile motion to ensure that their missiles go where they want them to go.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The wall is...well, a wall. Perhaps that's being&nbsp;disingenuous - it has the fine details that make Helm's Deep look great, and it does provide a logical way for troops to get up to the walls (via a staircase behind the walls), something that the massive Helm's Deep set itself lacks. The wall also houses one of those little catapults for a little extra playability and an opportunity for the humans to fight back, which is nice. The wall has obviously been designed to attach to the rest of Helm's Deep, so you can be sure that it's a completely logical and aesthetically-pleasing extension to the left wall (assuming one is facing the fortress).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So is this worth the suggested retail price of $30 (or its equivalent)? The generous Minifigs do help to ease the conscience, and, like I said, it's not as if either of the builds is bad. It's probably not worth it on its own, but, once you've knuckled down for Helm's Deep, getting this set is more or less an inevitability. I don't know if there are any die-hard Eomer fans out there, but he's also nice to have for the sake of completion, and another horse to ride with King Theoden is a plus. In terms of price, the best comparison I can think of is Tower Raid (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7037-1"">7037</a>), which is quite a bit more impressive though with fewer Minifigs and not quite as detailed. As for me, I love the Lord of the Rings, so I'm happy to have it. It's up to you if you want to get this or say Uruk-goodbye to it. (I'll get my coat.)&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,2
"Almaras","2012-06-10T01:48:37.657Z","Great on its own, but brilliant when joined with The Battle of Helms Deep","<font size=""4""><p>The Uruk-Hai Army set is a fantastic army builder, but also works well as a standalone set. With four fighting Uruk-Hai and only two Rohirrim (One is Eomer, so all is not lost!) There is plenty of action in this set.</p>
<p>The Uruk-Hai have with them a mighty ballista, which is big, bad and just plain awesome! The wheels are cool – I thought they would be wobbly and unstable, but they hold well. The wings are adjustable, but that is only for personal preference, they don’t actually serve a purpose by moving. The wood panels are PRINTED! There is not a sticker in sight! And of course, there are the flick-fire missiles themselves. The launcher works well, firing the missiles evenly, which looks cool. But I was a little disappointed when I realised I wouldn’t be able to adjust the angle they fire at, so you can’t be too close or they will go over the top and, if you’re lucky, they might hit your archer in the head, but won’t do any damage to the wall. But they are fired at a surprising force and are strong enough to take out Eomer on his horse, if you angle it right.</p>
<p>The piece of wall, although cool, is kind of boring. It’s just that: a wall. There’s a small catapult, but it’s no match for the Uruk-Hai’s ballista. Behind the wall is a flight of stairs, so I guess they could call a truce and have fun sliding down on Eomer’s shield, but that’s about all. But that’s okay because it attaches to the deeping wall on the Battle of Helms Deep set, which is awesome to be able to extend the wall!</p>
<p>The minifigures are the best part of this set. Four fight-ready Uruk-Hai, two with full armour and pikes, one with a helm, and an awesome new shield and sword, and one with just the new shield and sword, but with a hair piece. They all have the same torso, with double sided printing, legs with printing, and double sided heads, one side which is angry, and the other side that is really angry and has the white hand of Saruman. And their armour and weapons are incredible! Excitement has been building for the new shield and swords since the first grainy picture was leaked, and they do not disappoint! But they’re not so good if you’re one of the two Rohirrim. The set comes with one archer, who has double sided printing on his torso and head (one grim face, one angry face), a plain helm, a quiver and a loaded bow, ready to pick off the Uruk-Hai below. And you also get Eomer, with his fancy tunic, gold printing on his helm, a Rohan shield, a spear, and a sword attached to his saddle. The only problem with including Eomer in this set is that if you want multiples to build your army and extend Helms Deep, you’re going to end up with multiple Eomer’s, but I guess you could make him blend in with the other soldiers.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great set and an even better army builder! It works well on its own, particularly the ballista, but for maximum epicness, attach to The Battle of Helms Deep!</p></font>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

A load of mini figures, a great catapult and a wonder full looking wall with a stairs. But the set is meant of course to expand Helms Deep and both your army&#39;s, still it&#39;s playable standing alone too.&nbsp;Now, a year on the market, it is getting affordable to buy it. Great set, great figures and great parts; definitely worth the 5 bricks. The set in total reminds me bit of the 1984 Castle set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6061-1"">6061-1: Siege Tower </a>only that one had a siege tower off course instead of the catapult. The set reminds me a bit to the small Castle sets of the 1980&#39;s that you could connect together with as result a big Castle !</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong>: Not to difficult to do, first you built the good working catapult with the 2 hooks. Looks like the weapon used in the movie, moves well and shoots good. Second built is the small wall with a mirrored left and right side in fact with in the back a stairs and on top a small catapult. Behind the wall you mount a stairs to enter the top, the center of the wall has place for a small catapult. All of this is an easy built so I stick to 4 bricks.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: The parts are outstanding, of course the<strong> 6 !!</strong> mini figures with all great weapons and shields&nbsp;and the new horse for Eomer. The catapult and wall parts are 99% useful, some of them with an extra remark like the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2431pb243"">tiles with wood patern</a> and of course the new <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=98283"">bricks with masonry profile</a>.&nbsp;The Light Bluish Grey with Sand green color mix for the wall is great.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: Looking at the result is reason 1 for the 5 bricks here but it is ment of course to put it together with Helms Deep where it reaches a 6 brick playability nomination.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong>: Just introduced the price in Holland in retail shops was &euro;40,00 which is a bit overpriced. Now, one year later, you can find it new for about &euro;30,00 which is a more reasonable price in my opinion. I don&#39;t think it will be a set that will turn out to be a collectors item. Maybe if you buy more and keep it MISB you can make a small profit after Lego will stop producing it.</p>

"123MrBrick","2014-06-29T16:25:25.66Z","Amazing!","<p>I got this one a few years back, and I still love it. Uruk-hai army is great for army building, and for a normal set. It is an amazing deal for 30$.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is one of the newer high quality boxes. The front of the box shows the whole set in action, set to a Rohan background. The standard minifig &#39;box&#39; is in the bottom left hand corner, as well as the top. The back of the package shows the features of the set and the mini figs battling. The instruction manual shows the same scene as the front of the box. As always, the booklet is clear and easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t many special parts in this set, as you are mostly just building a wall. However, there are some, such as the hooks and harpoons on the ballista&nbsp;and the molded bricks on the wall. Even though there are many standard bricks, they are still useful for MOCs!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has four awesome Uruk-hai. They are all the same but with different accessories. The torso and leg printing are astoundingly accurate to the Uruk clothing in the films. The printing also continues to the hips and the back of the torso. The head is double-sided. One side is an angry face, and the other is even angrier with the White Hand of Saruman. The entire minifig looks like it has just been shrunk down from the screen. One of the Uruks has hair, representing the warrior that stood on the rock before the battle began. This Uruk also has the new Uruk shield and scimitar, which are both amazing parts. The next Uruk is the same, but features the extremely awesome Uruk helmet instead of hair. I love this piece. It looks EXACTLY like the helmet in the films. The other two Uruks&nbsp;have the helmet as well as a chest piece and a halberd. All four look great together, especially the halberd carriers. Let&#39;s have a look at Eomer now. He has some nice leg and hip printing, but it doesn&#39;t really continue to the torso. Speaking of the torso, it looks just like the films. The only problem I really have is that the shoulders should be square, like in the movie. That was one of the iconic parts of Eomer. Eomer has a great double head. One side is neutral, while the other is angry. It really looks like Karl Marx&#39;s Eomer. Last comes accessories. Eomer has a dark green cape, a knight sword, the new spear style, and a shield. The shield is the same as Captain America&#39;s, but with a great Rohan design. Eomer&nbsp;shares his helmet with the Rohan soldier and Theoden. Eomer&#39;s&nbsp;is silver with a gold crest. It is extremely accurate to the films. The Rohan soldier has plain brown legs, which is disappointing. He has a nice chain mail torso and a plain brown quiver. This fig has a great face with an orange beard. His helmet is the same as Eomer&#39;s, but with a silver crest. He also comes with a standard bow. I really like this bunch of figs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty simple because it is mostly just putting a wall together. However, it does get a little tougher with the ballista.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. The Uruks are easily displayed and this set will be even better when I get Helm&#39;s Deep!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great starter for any LOTR or castle fan. I love it, and you can buy multiples to add to Helm&#39;s Deep.</p>

"jeroenaa95","2013-03-03T08:53:26.993Z","great army builder, for both sides.","<p>This set is €40, a bit too expensive, but it is a great army builder. It comes with one new horse. I'll start with the minifigures.</p>
<p>Éomer: He is unique to this set. He has nice printing on his torso and on his legs. He has two faces, one is angry, the other one is angry with his mouth open in a scream. He also has a green cape, very cool, a nice new helmet with printing, and he also has a new shield, green with gold, and a spear and sword. Overall, he looks great. </p>
<p>Rohan soldier: He is also unique to this set, but I hope there will be more of him in other sets. He doesn't have a horse, that is a big flaw in this set. Everybody knows that Rohan soldiers fight from the back of a horse. He has two faces, one angry face and the other one is angry with his mouth open. He has printing on his torso and on his back, and that looks very cool. He has the same helmet as Éomer, but without printing. Overall, he looks great.</p>
<p>Uruk-hai (4x): They look great, with heavy armor, new swords, new shields and old halberds, a new (I think) hairpiece and offcourse a new, awesome looking, helmet. Two of them have a halberd, a helmet, and armor. The other two have the new swords and new shields, one of them has hair, the other one has a helmet. The printing on the uruk-hai is great. They have leg-printing, and torso-printing, also on their back. They have two faces, one really angry, whitout the white hand of Saruman, the other one really, really angry, with the mouth open, and the with the white hand of Saruman. </p>
<p>Now the wall-piece: This is an expansion of the Helms deep wall. It has 5 new bricks, with a pattern on it, I don't know how to call it, but is looks great. The build&nbsp;of the wall isn't hard.&nbsp;I don't have Helms deep, but I want it. </p>
<p>And last but not least, the Uruk-hai ballista: It looks great, no stickers, that is great. It doesn't shoot the two hooks really far, but that doesn't matter. The build isn't hard.</p>
<p>Overall, a great set. I only have one, but I want at least one more. I higly recommend it to any Castle of LotR fan, it is a great army builder.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Telcontar","2013-01-12T20:12:32.5Z","Geat Expansion, But Good On Its Own","<p>The Uruk-hai Army set is meant to go with its big brother, Helm's Deep, but it's great on its own too.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nicely made showing the epic battle at the Hornburg.&nbsp; On the back it highlights several of the ""play features.""&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The part selection here is quite good and varied.&nbsp; We get some technic in the ballista, basic bricks in the wall, and several rare colored plates, pennants and minifig accessories.&nbsp; One of the highlights in this category are the new ""profile bricks"" with the engravings on the side to make it look more worn down.&nbsp; Those and the light, pale, green bricks really add texture to the wall.&nbsp; On the ballista LEGO printed the wood bricks so we don't have stickers which is really nice.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Being a battle back type of set we get lots of minifigs, 6 to be exact.&nbsp; First I'll start with the good guys:</p><p><strong>Rohan Soldier:</strong>&nbsp; He's one of my favorites in this set, if only there were two of him!&nbsp; His chain mail printing is very nice but his helmet is the real draw.  They are so accurate to the movie to the extent of even including the horse heads on the top!  People have complained about him not having leg printing and I can see why they are disappointed.  But I'm not going to throw a fit over it.  Plus it helps to further distinguish him from Eomer.  He is, of course, just a common soldier.</p><p><strong>Eomer</strong>:&nbsp; He is also fantastic.  His torso printing is very well done, especially on the back.  I'm glad LEGO went the extra step to print backs on all these LotR minifigs, even when they have caped or beards to cover them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I already talked about&nbsp;the helmet mold in the last section but&nbsp;unlike the&nbsp;soldier, Eomer's has&nbsp;gold highlights over the grey.  Also unlike the soldier, Eomer has printed legs.</p><p><strong>Uruk</strong>-<strong>hai</strong>:  These guys are tough, and they definitely look it.  From the heads to the color&nbsp;scheme, and especially to their weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's nice that LEGO gives us a little variety and mixes it up a little bit by giving some of them hair while giving others armour and so forth.  Their legs and torso&nbsp;have the Uruk's armour printed on them which looks very&nbsp;nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have&nbsp;extra grey armour too.  Their&nbsp;heads are all&nbsp;double sided.  The first face is their ""angry"" expression while the other side is their ""extra angry"" expression.  This ""extra angry"" side has the white&nbsp;hand of Saruman printed on it which explains for the extra surge of rage.  Their weapons&nbsp;(except for the&nbsp;ones with pikes) are all new molds and are very accurate to the movie, from the spike on the swords to the shape of their shields and&nbsp;especially to their helmets.  Fantastic job LEGO!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building the wall is,...well,...building a wall.  The extra extension out which makes room for the catapult on top makes things a bit more exciting though.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballista is the fun part though.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was curious to see how the firing mechanism would work for this one and it was kind of interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like flick fire missiles but you use this&nbsp;plate/tile built beam to fire them, not your finger.&nbsp; It's a neat idea but it doesn't work the best.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model by itself looks great.&nbsp; It's even better with Helm's Deep.&nbsp; But it is fun by itself too.&nbsp; It has tons of great playability and action but it probably wouldn't be as good for a display.&nbsp; The wall looks great with the profile and pale green bricks which really adds texture.&nbsp; The ballista, even though it doesn't fire well, looks menacing and very fitting for Saruman's fighting Uruk-hai.&nbsp; Hey, if you're frustrated with it's poor firing mechanisms it's the perfect height&nbsp;for a siege ramp.&nbsp; I know it sound silly but my siblings had fun doing that.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is a great extension to the short wall you get in Helm's Deep but it's fun by itself.&nbsp; Younger kids will love all the minifgs and cool battle features.&nbsp; My only complaint (other than the modified flick-fire missiles) is that the price is a bit high.&nbsp; Perhaps we could've gotten another minifig or two such as another Rohan soldier, a Lothlorien Elf, or even Gandalf the White.</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-12-12T07:28:26.977Z","Fantastic battle pack and add-on for Helms Deep ","<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by the price of this set, it is most definitely a battle pack. And while orcs may be readily available in every set (although not always Uruk&nbsp;Hai), Eomer&nbsp;and the Rohan&nbsp;Soldier are unique to this set. In fact the only other Rohan minifigure available is King Theodin in the larger <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9474-1/The-Battle-of-Helm-s-Deep"">Helms Deep</a> set which this one attaches to. Because of these two unique minifigures, and the Uruk&nbsp;Hai&nbsp;armor, this set has become outrageously expensive to obtain these days. As this was the only Lord of the Rings set that I didn&#39;t own, I watched this set on eBay for about 2 months before finding one that I could get at a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>So you get 4 Uruk&nbsp;Hai&nbsp;which is great to have. Two are identical, and they have armor and a helmet. The third would be identical but is without armor. And the last is unique and has hair. He actually reminds me of Lurtz&nbsp;from the Orc Forge although he is a different color and has a different design. It&#39;s hard to complain about getting 4 orcs, but...</p>

<p>You also get to Rohan minifigures. First is Eomer, and the other, a generic soldier. These minifigures&nbsp;have the same helmet mold as King Theodin, only Eomer, while featuring a printed design, isn&#39;t quite as fancy as Theodin (not gold), and the generic soldier lacks printing on his helmet. Unlike Theodin, neither of these wear armor although it is printed on their torso and legs. Eomer features a fancy shirt, but chain mail is visible on his legs, whereas the generic one only wears chain mail. You also get a single horse for the two of them which seems to be a pretty major oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, given Uruk Hai are included in Helms Deep, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9476-1/The-Orc-Forge"">Orc Forge</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10237-1/Tower-of-Orthanc"">Tower of Orthanc</a>, was it really necessary to include 4 in this set? Why couldn&#39;t Lego have replaced one or two of them with additional Rohan soldiers? Oh well...</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Model</strong></p>

<p>First you build the Uruk Hai ballista. While the build is very simple, it is a huge improvement over the typical catapults that come in other LOTR sets. Perhaps the biggest surprise about this build is how the wheels are created, it isn&#39;t revolutionary, but it doesn&#39;t use wheel bricks. Of course the other pleasant surprise is that there are 3 tiles with a printed wood pattern. This set has no stickers! But why couldn&#39;t Lego have used this print elsewhere in the LOTR line?</p>

<p>Anyways, the completed ballista looks amazing. It truly does look like what the orcs used in the movie, and is definitely threatening. The only problem, it&#39;s nearly as tall as the walls of Helms Deep, which I suppose means it is just that much more menacing! The firing mechanism is creative and more than sufficient for attacking the walls, just don&#39;t expect to get a whole lot of distance out of the hooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is the wall. As you probably expect, the build is very similar to the walls in the Helms Deep set. It is really nothing more than just basic stacking. But it has non-symmetrical detailing which keeps it interesting, and it features stairs, which are something not available in the larger Helms Deep set. It also features a very boring catapult, that looks even worse standing next to the Orc ballista.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself , while not great as a stand-alone model because there just isn&#39;t anything to it, is certainly nice when added on to Helms Deep. It actually reminds me of my <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6041-1/Armor-Shop"">Armor Shop</a> set from the 80&#39;s that connects to my <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6080-1/King-s-Castle"">King&#39;s Castle</a> set, and there are a handful of other add-on sets from the 80&#39;s castle line that are very similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I do like this set. Certainly a much better battle pack than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79012-1/Mirkwood-Elf-Army"">Mirkwood Elves</a> one (although that one does have a warg). While I would have preferred more Rohan soldiers instead of orcs, I really can&#39;t complain about this set. I suppose we should be very happy we got these two additional Rohan minifigures&nbsp;since all we got for Gondor&nbsp;is a single Aragon minifigure (and a Boromir, but he of course doesn&#39;t make it home). It&#39;s difficult to find this at an affordable price these days, but if you do, don&#39;t hesitate to buy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that said, should you want to build an impressively long Helms Deep, I would buy one of these sets complete with the minifigures. Then part out another wall or two on Bricklink. None of the parts are all that unique so it won&#39;t cost you too much. Of course you could get another ballista as well to beef up your orc army with, just sub out the printed tiles for plain ones as they are the only parts that will cost you a lot, and really aren&#39;t too necessary.&nbsp;</p>
