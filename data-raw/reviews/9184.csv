"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-22T09:36:20.077Z","""This was once the great Watchtower of Amon Sûl. Nowadays kids hang out there and smoke."" ","Back when Lord of the Rings sets started showing up in toy fair photographs, I was immediately captivated by one display in particular, and that was the Attack on Weathertop. It's not as if I have any particularly strong affinity for this scene in the movie or for this location in general - in fact, in the movies, anyway, the Weathertop scene is actually pretty brief and mostly serves as an exotic locale for Frodo to get stabbed. There was something purely aesthetic about the set that really attracted me to it, and, now that I have it in my possession, I feel that this attraction was not misplaced. I have little doubt in my mind that Weathertop is among the most unique designs ever released by LEGO, and the bottom line is that it looks every bit as fantastic as I thought it would.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>If there is anything at all to quibble about regarding Attack on Weathertop, it's probably price. The completed model does not look like a $60 one, size-wise, and there's a good reason for that: much of Weathertop consists of small pieces that are used to create a very intimate sense of detail that's rarely seen. To soften the blow of the price, Weathertop comes with five Minifigs: Frodo, who is the same as the one in Shelob Attacks (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=9470-1"">9470</a>) except for having a cape of a different colour; Merry, who shows up in this set only and is as adorable as the rest of the Hobbits; Aragorn, or, as he was known at the time of Weathertop, Strider, who shows up the Battle of Helm's Deep (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=9474-1"">9474</a>) as well; and a pair of Ringwraiths, both of whom are exclusive to this set (sadly, you'll need to buy four-and-a-half Weathertops to get a full complement of them).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[At this juncture, I'd like to make a general remark, since we're on the subject of Minifigs: it occurred to me that there are absolutely no female Minifigs in the entire LOTR line, unless you're going to count Shelob as one. The books themselves took some flack for featuring a grand total of maybe four significant female characters, but seriously - no Arwen? No Eowyn? I can only assume that a Rivendell set is in the cards later on. But anyway.]</div><div><br></div><div>A nice inclusion here is the pair of horses for the Ringwraiths, which look menacing and are all-round awesome. Initially, I imagined the ""rearing"" ability of the horses to be a bit of a gimmick, but the truth is that these new horses - which I imagine are going to remain as the mainstay of medieval sets in time to come - are a significant evolution over the traditional design that we've had for, what, twenty years now? The mould is a lot more detailed, and the simple repositioning of their legs gives a greater feel of movement even when not rearing up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is one secondary build included in this set, and that would be a bizarre rock thing that serves no purpose whatsoever. Sure, it looks nice and adds character to the environs, but I have no idea what to do with it. I guess Hobbits can play hide-and-seek there or something.</div><div><br></div><div>I should refrain, however, from getting distracted any further from talking about the true meat of this set, the Weathertop model itself. The general scheme is one of those ""fold out""-type sets, much like the houses in Medieval Market Village (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10193-1"">10193</a>) and so forth. Luckily, there's not much agony over whether to keep it open or shut, because the interior is mostly functional, featuring a rudimentary weapons rack, a weird black table thing which I believe is supposed to hold the <a href=""http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Palant%C3%ADri"">Palantir</a>, and a pair of flick-fire missiles (???), presumably so that Hobbits can defend themselves when the Allies invade or something.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For ease of reference, I'm going to say that the archway is the front of the set and the place where the curved sets lead up to the top is the back. The front of the set really struck me as a very fancy bit of LEGO engineering, for in order to mimic the curvature of the outer walls, several interconnected hinge pieces are placed together and slowly angled until the plates are able to fit together in their usual way. It's remarkably detailed and looks completely different from any other LEGO set I have, and I love it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The back is no less cool. The curved steps are a throwback to LEGO Harry Potter, I realise, but they're used to great effectiveness here as well. These steps lead up to the top of the tower, where there is ample space among the ordered chaos of the watchtower ruins for battle scenes of every kind, including one where <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/UtarEmpire/2012-05-22_09-25-41_591.jpg"">Captain America and Strider decide to team up against a&nbsp;Nazgûl goon</a>. If that doesn't sell it for you, I don't know what will.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I do think that Weathertop was designed with AFOLs squarely in mind, the result of which is a beautiful set with a non-standard construction that is sure to appeal to old and new fans of LEGO. I confess myself biased because LOTR plus Marvel has honestly been a licensed theme nerd dream to me, but I sincerely hope that either one (or both!) of these themes ends up having the longevity that the recently-retired Harry Potter theme had. All the same, I am certain that Weathertop will appeal to any fan of Castle or fantasy LEGO, and most certainly to any LOTR fan. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"icepick","2012-06-01T13:56:48.77Z","Totally worth it","<p>Overall I loved this set. Worth it for the wraiths alone for me. It has a great presence and detail to it.<br></p>

<h4>Parts</h4>Love all the new stuff. Especially the weapons. Obviously the horses are incredible with the articulation and printing. A lot of thought obviously went into the new horse design.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>They look stunning. The wraiths are a little plain, I guess. But they nail the look and feel of the ringwraiths, so it's admissible. The gold on Merry's chest was surprising and looks really good.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This was the hardest set I've ever built. It's detailed and intricate and wants to fall apart a lot. Or you drop pieces into nooks and crannies.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p> That said it's easily the most advanced thing I've ever built and I'm quite proud of it, haha. It looks amazing all together. It has a great crumbly presence to it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Worth every penny. Little hard to play with since the top arches like to fall off, but plenty of room to play if you remove the superfluous weapon rack and open it up.</p><p><br></p><p>I can't get over how awesome it is.&nbsp; :D<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"sudorum","2012-06-04T14:52:17.77Z","Stormy Weather Approaches ","<span class=""Apple-style-span"">Weathertop's rocky ruins and its wild, naturalistic setting look even better in bricks. Its lego adaptation perfectly captures the mystique of the Lord of the Rings series. Furthermore, it is unlike so many other sets not just because of its untamed appearance, but because of its rounded curvature. Consequently, quite a unique and entertaining build results. The minifigures, too, are excellent. Merry and Frodo both have hobbit-sized capes and weapons. Frodo's alternate face has ghostly blue eyes and is meant to make him appear as if he is under possession of the ring. By the way, the eponymous ring is an amazing little creation, and the set even comes with two extras. The darkly garbed Ringwraiths and their newly posable steeds are ominous additions.&nbsp;</span><p>The interior of Weathertop can be accessed by pulling the two halves of the set apart, possible through hinge pieces. An archway leads into the cavernous interior of Weathertop. The first half is decorated with a weapons rack and two small figurine statues (which are actually the minifigures used in the game sets that lego produces). The second half of the interior is somewhat curious. Located within is a strange black pedestal whose purpose still remains a mystery to me, and disturbingly enough, flick-fires. Now, flick fires are fine in Star Wars sets, but they don't have a place in the Lord of the Rings realm. Surely playability can be increased in a more creative way! Lego shouldn't have to succumb to the crutch of flick-fire missiles in every set. The exterior of Weathertop includes the hobbits' campfire, a spiral staircase, and the crumbled remains of a tower. There is also a classic trapdoor which works remarkably well. On the downside of things, this set is grossly overpriced. Truthfully, its unique attributes don't really make up for this. Also, I recall Weathertop appearing larger in the film. The brick version, though magnificent, is a bit downsized. If it was bigger, which I don't believe is asking too much, it would be worth its sixty dollar price tag.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,3
"captain_radda_radda","2012-06-11T03:37:31.493Z","Ringwraiths. Gotta Love Them Ringwraiths","To begin, I am obsessed with the Ringwraiths from LOTR. I don't know why, but they intrigue me and have always been both creepy and awesome at the same time. And now, I finally own one (well two actually!) That is the sole reason i purchased this set and honestly, I wasn't expecting much more out of it. However, I was blown away. This set is superb and a very interesting and innovative build with unique methods that sell the watchtower look. I love the weathered bricks and the moss coming out of the fortress that give the illusion of aging. Also, I enjoyed seeing the micro-figures being put to different use in the form of statuettes. 

The campsite in the front is also excellently detailed and a perfect fit with enough accessories to keep the fun going. The staircase is also superbly designed with hinges and studs to lock the pieces in place to ensure that they don't sway around. I'd also like to note that there is a nice amount of space on top of the fortress for the Ringwraiths and the heroes to battle. The trap door is a nice feature too that locks into place and is level with the rest of the upper story. However, my only complaint is the peg that holds the door in place, as it looks too protruding and out of place when you turn the set around. 

The little rock-moss-bush piece is cool too, but I don't really understand its purpose. The minifigures are easily the draw of this set, as it is the only way to obtain the iconic Ringwraiths. Aragorn is truly awesome. He is very well detailed and movie accurate and I'd like to note that his coat transitions nicely from torso piece to torso piece. His hair is perfect and I love the dual sided expressions. The hobbits are fantastic too, even though they annoyed the hell out of me in the movie. They are nicely detailed and the new hairpiece is perfect for they're shaggy look. (Actually it's perfect for me because I can finally make an accurate SIGFIG of myself with the new hairpiece from Frodo) Merry is also nicely detailed and I love the Hobbits' new swords, especially Frodo's. Speaking of swords, the new long swords (could they be Claymores?) are beautiful. 

They are excellently designed and nicely streamlined to make any character look mighty. Now, on to the true attracttion: the Ringwraiths. They are truly awesome creatures and although they are not extremely detailed, they truly capture the look of their movie counterparts. The ragged cape cloak give them a spooky look and ghostly feel. The cape actually is angled back to give them a flowing appearance while also allowing them to mount the horses without the cape being crammed into the saddle or forcefully bent. This adds to the ghostly look and captures the image even more. The head is somewhat of a paradox given the fact that Lego minifigures must have a head to hold a head accessory, yet 

Ringwraiths are faceless creatures with a hood that floats. I really can't argue with Lego's decision to place a black head, as a clear head would have given it an odd look since the head peg would be visible. Also, a head with printing would have been a bad move since the Ringwraiths literally have nothing there. Nevertheless, it works and the Ringwraiths are awesome minifigures. I want to state that these are the first minifigures in a while that actually look like minifigures.

 In an age of Hulks, Wampas, Arc Troopers, Boba Fetts, and Iron Men, it seems as though Lego minifigures are becoming less and less like block people and more and more like limited mobility action figures. Dear Lego, it's okay if your block people look like block people. Sincerely, old school Lego fans worldwide. Anyway, all and all, this set is phenomenal and an excellent build, yet beware the price as this is a little steep. 

Aside from that, this set is a masterpiece and a testament to the fact that Lego can indeed still innovate while keeping things true to the original Lego formula.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"mathew","2012-06-11T02:19:53.267Z","Brick Cake","Like others, Weathertop really grabbed me from an aesthetic standpoint. &nbsp;I love that it is a complete model and not just a facade like many sets. &nbsp;You get a bunch of really useful bricks and hinges. &nbsp;I enjoyed building the curved exterior walls. &nbsp;I also love the new horse. &nbsp;I love the ring (and that you you get 3). &nbsp;The minifigs are very cool as well. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But the true heart of this set is Weathertop itself (which looks like a cute little cake made of bricks). &nbsp;There's a ton of detail and no stickers. &nbsp;While I wish it were a little bigger, it's really perfect as it is. &nbsp;My favorite detail is the spiral staircase. &nbsp;My second favorite detail is the use of the mini-minifigs as statues. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Lego should consider expanding on the ""castle ruins"" set design of Weathertop when they re-introduce the Castle theme after LOTR and The Hobbit sets run their course. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A few cons: &nbsp;The Nazgul hoods easily pop off partially due to the cloaks. &nbsp;Lego should of made the hoods a little tighter or the cloaks a little looser. &nbsp;I've also found some color inconsistency amongst the bricks. &nbsp;Overpriced at $60 but perfect at $45-50.</div><div><br></div><div>With the current price drop ($45 or less from a couple of online retailers) I completely recommend Attack on Weathertop to any fans of Castle or aesthetically interesting models.</div></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Almaras","2012-06-10T01:51:33.617Z","Nazgul! Two of them!","<font size=""4""><p>This has to be my favourite set. For starters, it has Nazgul! Two of them! Not to mention Merry and Aragorn. The structure is so detailed, and is very well designed. The exterior looks fantastic: the mix of colours works great and the curvature around the back is a great feature – it’s only a shame that it is hidden at the back, but it’s a nice change from sets that couldn’t look better from the front, and couldn’t look any worse from behind. The arches are cool, but I can’t go past the micro-figs from the Lego games: to have them included as small statues is, I think, genius. They are my favourite little design feature of the set.</p>
<p>And if this wasn’t enough, it opens up to reveal more inside! In one half there are two more micro-fig statues and a weapons rack, which includes another hobbit sized sword and a spear. There are two more torches and a mouse. In the other half is a strange black table thing that doesn’t seem to serve any purpose at all, except maybe adding to the mystery of Weathertop? But even in that it fails, because the biggest mystery of Weathertop is: Why are there flick-fire missiles</p></font><p><font size=""4"" face=""Calibri""><font size=""4"" face=""Calibri"">?</font></font><font size=""4""> Where they in the extended edition and I just missed them</font><font size=""4"" face=""Calibri""><font size=""4"" face=""Calibri"">?</font></font><font size=""4""> Until these questions are answered, I refused to build them. I rotated the black 1x1 pieces 90degrees so that the solid sides are showing and I have left it at that, because flick-fire missiles and Weathertop are to things that I believe should not be mixed. Not matter how many Nazgul are attacking.</font></p><font size=""4"">
<p>Flick-fire missiles aside, there are plenty of other awesome features to make up for it. The trap door works surprisingly well, as the lever you pull to release the trap door also resets it so that you don’t have to do it manually, which is always a bonus. But the biggest thing I was impressed with was the stairs: they don’t wobble and spin around, something that has provided me with endless frustration in the Harry Potter sets. They still move a little, but for the most part they are held in place which is brilliant!</p>
<p>As good as the structure is, the minifigures are better. Included with the set is another Frodo in standard travelling clothes. He has a double sided head with what I call his Pre-Stabbed face and his Post-Stabbed face. The second Hobbit included is my personal favourite of the Hobbitses, Merry. His gold waistcoat has a wonderful swirly pattern with bulging buttons (perhaps he should move away from the cooking fire). But for me it is his smirk that I like best, and because of this smirk, I believe it is Merry who best reflects the actor he portrays. Defending the Hobbits is Strider (Aragorn). Lego once again blew me away with their intricate details on this mini-figure. I was pleasantly surprised to see the Evenstar Arwen gave Aragorn around his neck. But the Nazgul are my favourite. I wasn’t expecting them to have front and back printing, due to their cloaks, but they do, which is nice. Unfortunately one of my Nazgul cloaks mustn’t have been aligned right when they were hole punched as two of the three holes were incomplete, forcing me to resort to my [lack of] sewing skills. After only 20 minutes and 3 pricked fingers I had two magnificent Nazgul riding wonderfully evil steeds (complete with red eyes!) around my desktop.</p>
<p>This has to be my favourite set of all the incredible new sets. I’m not sure exactly why this one stands out to me, as they all feature impressive details, but something has just drawn me to it from the start.</p></font>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-05T11:16:29.863Z","Attack of Ringwraiths","<p><strong>Set #9472: Attack on Weathertop: </strong>The Lord of the Rings is one of those Themes that is just chock full of amazing detail and excellently designed sets. It's also a great Medieval/Fantasy/Castle based Theme for fans of such builds and it features a lot of brilliant Mini-Figures to collect. Just all around great fun, there are a few issues that some fans of the Theme have, basically LEGO is not reaching it's full potential, case in point so far this is the only set with Ringwraiths in it. This means that if you want to have all 9 you're stuck buying them off such sites as Bricklink or E-Bay or picking up 5 of this set just to army build them.</p>
<p>It's a real shame that LEGO has yet to realize the Lord of the Rings full potential, so many rich characters that haven't been made available yet and no true Battle Packs which would have really worked wonders on finishing off the proper number of Ringwraiths. Oh well, perhaps we'll see some awesome sets for 2014, anyway we're here to find out why this set is so good. Let's continue shall we?</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box design I really enjoy, it shows the set and all the features quite nicely and includes a list of all the Mini-Figurs in the set by name. This box design compliments the sets of Lord of the Rings first year quite nicely.</p>
<p>The instructions in such a large boxed set are not protected by cardboard, this can lead to problems if the packing hasn't been good. They are quite large though, mine suffered minor problems, the back is a bit crumpled at the top, but not too badly. Chances are they may not suffer as much packing damage as others because of the sheer size and thickness of this book.</p>
<p>The steps are straight forward and easy to follow. One aspect of the Lord of the Rings instruction manuals I haven't mentioned yet that I like a lot is the fact they include a checklist of what you build with each numbered bag at the front (at least as far as most of the larger sets are concerned). This means you have an idea of how many bags are in the set and what each bag will build before you get started, a really nice touch on LEGO's part.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set is chock full of parts, it has the excellent spiral staircase assembly that I really enjoy, a few great Mini-Figure accessories and there are a lot of special sculpted brick parts in tan, a tan bush, a lot of empty stems and a really nice touch LEGO Games Microfigures being used as statues.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of useful half-arch pieces and a load of bricks that MOCers will find uses for. It's just all around a great set for parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are five Mini-Figures in this set and three of them are unique to this set while one of them is shared with the largest set from 2012 (Aragorn) and the other is a common character with a unique cloth cape (Frodo).</p>
<p>The Ringwraith isn't anything special when you take a look at his print, the black double-sided torso is printed with a design that is similar (but not identical) to Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker from RotJ. The folds of the Ringwraith's robes are different, the print isn't what makes the pair of Ringwraiths in this set so impressive. The tattered hole filled black cloth cape, the dark black LotR swords the black horses with almost demonic looking facial printing... All of these elements combined make both Mini-Figures really impressive, it's partly why I feel that LEGO missed the boat in not making them available in a Battle Pack for 2013.</p>
<p>The best part about them though is the way the cape hangs off their back, it fits in such a way that it flows out behind him and isn't hindered while he's on horseback, it also makes it look like the Ringwraiths are constantly galloping after Frodo with their cloaks flapping in the wind. A really dynamic look that is pretty fun.</p>
<p>Frodo is identical to the Mini-Figure found in Shelob Attacks, the only difference for him is the use of a short dark&nbsp;green cloth cape instead of the grey elven cloak. He's still full of all the fun details we saw in Shelob Attacks so there's not much else to touch upon here.</p>
<p>Merriadoc or Merry for short is the other Hobbit found in this set and indeed the only set you'll find him in, to complete your Fellowship you'll need to buy this set, or track him down on Bricklink. He has a lot of nice detail, a double-sided torso print and a light green short cloth cape grace him. He's using the exact same hairpiece as the other Hobbits, in a&nbsp;darker orange&nbsp;tone compared to Sam. He also has a double-sided facial print, one smiling and happy the other yelling fiercely as he prepares to defend Frodo from the Ringwraiths. He has a short sword, a black pot, a carrot, a piece of chicken and a large rucksack/backpack piece as accessories. (Oh and a green apple.)</p>
<p>Aragorn can be found in this set from 2012 and The Battle of Helm's Deep, this exact same print is also found in the 2013 Pirate Ship Ambush set. This however is the cheapest method of obtaining his Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>He uses the same sword accessory as Gandalf for his weapon, he also has great printed detail, with a double-sided torso (the back of which is kind of plain), leg printing and a double-sided facial print. (One expression determined for battle the other more neutral.) His hair piece is the exact same as Prince Dastan from Prince of Persia (which by now has also been used for Thor and I believe one or two other characters).</p>
<p>All in all I think Aragorn is a great looking Mini-Figure, however I have noticed a slight inconsistency in the brown colours used for his torso and the matching print on his legs for the coat and belt he's wearing, the leg printing is a little lighter than it should be looking faded and washed out compared to the torso colouring.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>With 4 numbered bags you build weathertop in three installments and the first bag just builds a small set piece as well as the Ringwraiths.</p>
<p>This build works relatively free of any problems, though some of the steps involving the hinged plates can be a bit tricky to look right once you've started building on top of everything. Weathertop's build is really intricate and involves a lot of the pieces, naturally, the steps are relatively free of clutter and easy to spot where the parts go at each interval. Still it may need a bit of assistance if younger builders (particularly those under the recommended age limit) were to tackle this.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Weathertop looks a bit small for a mountain top, but that's the entire point. This model builds the actual top of the mountain, where the ruins are that shelters the Hobbits for a brief time during the night. These ruins look great, it's a really nifty looking representation of the top of Weathertop with a decent number of details.</p>
<p>With hinged bricks you can open it to play with more features such as a weapons rack with sword and spear and the flick-fire missiles which are included in this set. Yes, even though it makes no sense from an in-world perspective the Hobbits and Aragorn can shoot flick-fire missiles at the Ringwraiths, great fun for the kids I suppose who would still play with the set, a real headscratcher for older fans who know that Middle-Earth does not have missiles.</p>
<p>There's a trap door on one side of the upper portion of Weathertop as well so you can drop the floor out from the Ringwraith, or if you're feeling evil Aragorn and the Hobbits.</p>
<p>I really think the completed model in this set is pretty impressive, I love all the little details and the spiral staircase leading up to the top of the set is a great feature that I never get tired of. There's a lot to see and do, there's even a rat in this set. And the little cooking spot for the Hobbits which endangers them is a nice touch. I also think the small scraggly bush and part of a ruined structure microbuild model that is seperate from the main build makes a decent set piece.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I found this set to be surprisingly impressive and great fun to build. I do have a few minor issues with the set, mostly because it's the only way to get Ringwraiths, which is unfortunate because of how expensive it is if you wanted to get all 9 of them. I also do not like the inclusion of flick-fire missiles, fortunately they are built into the model in such a way as to be unobtrusive, so you don't have to worry about them if you don't care for them.</p>
<p>Everything else about this set is great, even Frodo since he has a different coloured cape is a welcome addition. The design of the build matches the on-screen representation as closely as it can in this scale. I would say the only really messed up detail about this set is the price, at 430 pieces 75$ CND is a tad on the high side, especially considering I recently picked up The LEGO Movie set Castle Cavalry which has a similar piece count and is 35$ cheaper. So I'd recommend this set, since it is getting harder to find I'd say if you can get a good deal on it take it, because you're going to want the set. I would suggest trying to get it on sale though. Half price would be a much better deal for this one.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"lkb57","2014-02-04T20:36:25.287Z","The Surprise MVP of the first LOTR Release","<p>I&#39;ll admit, when I first saw this set I was disappointed. It seemed a little silly to reduce Weathertop&ndash;&ndash;an entire hill&ndash;&ndash;down to a small 430 piece set. Boy, was I wrong. This is one amazing set, combining a fun/interesting build with great playability and a cast of awesome minifigures. If you don&#39;t read any further in this review, read this: BUY THIS SET!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Weathertop comes with 5 minifigures: Frodo, Merry, Aragorn, and 2 Black Riders. Merry and the Black Riders are unique to this set. As usual, TLC was diabolically clever and divided all the members of the Fellowship up among several sets, so if you want Merry, you either have to buy this set, or get him second hand. Luckily&ndash;&ndash;and also as usual&ndash;&ndash;all of these minifigures are superb. The Black Riders come with a new cape design that looks suitably ragged and spooky; the only problem with it is this particular cape folds over the minifigure shoulders, and the fabric is just stiff enough that the cape tends to buckle upwards and push the minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;hood off its head. I only struggled with this when first constructing the minifigures . . . . after I&#39;d pushed the hood back down a few times the cape softened up and it&#39;s not really an issue anymore. The Black Rider&#39;s torsos are printed front and back, and look excellent. Frodo, Merry and Aragorn all have double-printed heads with happy/angry expressions. Frodo&#39;s torso is the same as seen elsewhere. The printing on Merry and Aragorn&#39;s&nbsp;torsos is superb (the pattern of Merry&#39;s vest does an amazing job at capturing the movie look). The pattern of Aragorn&#39;s coat continues down his legs. In short, if you only buy this set for the minifigures, it&#39;s probably worth it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was not expecting building Weathertop to be as fun as it was. The designers use a lot of interesting techniques to construct the rounded shapes of Weathertop. Additionally, the whole set opens up to reveal a hidden chamber which&ndash;&ndash;though technically not in the book&ndash;&ndash;is incredibly fun in terms of playability, and is a sort of Easter Egg reference to the Barrow Downs that Frodo and his companions explore in the book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Despite it&#39;s small size, the finished model looks great, and does a surprisingly good job of looking like a ruined fortress while still being durable enough to move around and play with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I pretty much already said it, but: go buy this set. You won&#39;t regret it. This is one of the most iconic moments in the movie and book, and the set does an admirable job of bringing it to life. I don&#39;t think this set is being produced any longer, but if you catch a deal on Ebay, take advantage of it.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong>: Great fun building this set with for me some new techniques on how to built a round tower. Bags are numbered so a simple building sequence for this set. No big wall parts, but old fashioned brick by brick building. First the front part with small gate and second the back part of &quot;Weathertop&quot;, after that you built the first floor of this small ruin. When finished and clicked together simply a great result both opened and closed with also a nice interior&nbsp;!</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: Hard to mention all&nbsp;the good parts but the mini figures of course are outstanding as are the new horses. Overall a great mix of colors and some great parts like the stairs, the bricks with masonry profile, the 4 grey micro figures, the new weapons in different colors and a hugh amount of accessories. A great surprise were 2 extra Rings !!</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: What can I say, you can re-live the movie already with this set. It has all great features and figures for hours of fun, even for an AFOL like me. 5 Bricks with a bonus here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong>: I know licensed theme&#39;s are more expensive but in my opinion the official retail price in Holland being &euro;70,00 is a bit too much. Like said before, I waited for a good discount and got it for &euro;45,00 which is my opinion a good price for 430 part set. I think a normal retail price of &euro;55,00 would be reasonable here&nbsp;but still it&#39;s worth having it.</p>

Fantastic Starter set if you can afford it","<div><h4>Attack on Weathertop</h4><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>For passing my Intermediate 2 exams (Scottish Exams) with flying colours I was given £50 to play with, and I decided I wanted a Lord of the Rings set, and after a long think I chose this one so I wouldn't have any more money to throw around, as I buy lots of stupid little things in my spare time. &nbsp;I got this from Toys R Us for £49.99 and I was so excited that I was finally getting a Lord of the Rings set as I've been a fan for a while now! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Last Saturday (04/8/12) I was in that very Toys R Us, and I couldn't stop looking and examining the boxes of the Lord of the Rings sets as I thought they looked so superb in every aspect, so when it came to deciding which one to buy, it was difficult, but as I said, I settled on this one for many reasons (which I'll reveal to you in due course during the review).</div><div><br></div><h4><b>Box</b></h4><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11137.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Not an awful lot to say about the box, except that it probably could have been smaller as about a quarter of the space inside the box was unused, but that's me being picky, I mean the box was a good size but a little big.</div><div><br></div><h4>Bags</h4><div><br></div><div>Inside the box you get 4 bags (7 in total I believe as you do get smaller bags within the big bags) and the four big bags are numbered giving you an easy straightforward build as you know exactly which bag to use for the next part of the set.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bag 1</b> - In this bag you get a small cardboard box in which you get the Ringwraith's cloaks as well as the two hobbit cloaks. (which you need to set aside until Bag 4) &nbsp;You also get pieces to build the small rock formation that is used as a little add on to the main part. &nbsp;As well as those you also get the Ringwraiths, their weapons and of course their horses. You also get the saddles for the horses and the 4 pieces used as the fillers for the horses when you don't use the saddle, which they give you for all the animals in all the themes anyway. &nbsp;In this bag you get a brick separator (the new orange one) and 2 extra pieces (a flower stalk and a cheese slope)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bag 2</b> - In this bag (which was by far my favourite) you get Aragorn (AKA Strider) and the first half of the Weathertop build. You get the weapons for the weapon rack in the inside (a spear and a darker, smaller sword). &nbsp;This bag includes the trapdoor feature and 5 extra pieces (a spear, a cheese slope, a hook, a technic pin and a flame piece)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bag 3</b> - In this bag you get the second half of the Weathertop build which includes the stairs. This bag contains 3 extra pieces (a stud, a hook and a 1x1 flat tile)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bag 4</b> - In this bag you get Frodo, Merry, Sting, The Ring, Food and the pieces to build the upper part of the Weathertop build. This bag contains 7 extra pieces (Sting, 2 rings, a carrot stalk, a flower stalk, a stud and a flame piece.</div><div><br></div><h4>Instructions</h4><div><br></div><div>For this set you get 1 Instruction manual which has 67 steps of building, 84 pages, 1 piece count page (which shows Frodo's cloak to be a normal sized minifig one in error), a double page insert showing all the minifigures available in the wave and also the set numbers of the sets they come with (apart from the unreleased poly-bag sets), a page showing the URL of the LEGO The Lord of the Rings website, a page showing The Mines of Moria and the Orc Forge, a page showing Helms Deep and a page showing the Video Game promo with a promo for the upcoming Hobbit sets.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build Itself</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is pretty straight forward and uses some brand new techniques which in my opinion are excellent, it gives the MOCer the ability to incorporate the same techniques into their own creations. (I especially like the way they have made the staircase stay in position, if only they had done the same with the old Harry Potter sets...) The way the rocks have been done is brilliant and also the way they have made the set round is fantastic as well.</div><div><br></div><h4>Parts</h4><div><br></div><div>The parts in this set are fantastic! it contains 9 of the new brick brick pieces which are really nice and I love the new molds (sting, the Ring, the cloaks, the weapons, and of course the statues) &nbsp;Also the part which is used for the trapdoor mechanism, the technic pin, is brand new too! &nbsp;The sack next to the campfire is a nice feature too, albeit a little big for the hobbits.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div><br></div><div><i>Frodo Baggins&nbsp;</i></div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11145-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11146-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Frodo sports a dark green cloak and is basically the same figure you find in the Shelob Attacks set (set 9470). &nbsp;He has a double sided face, one expression shows determination whilst the other shows him gasping as he is stabbed by the Morgul blade (or in the case of the other set, Shelob's stinger). Frodo also has a torso which features some nice back-printing. The new hobbit hair is fantastic and really gives the hobbit figures some character, which is really nice. &nbsp;Frodo has been supplied in this set with Sting, which unfortunately is inaccurate as he doesn't recieve sting until after this scene in the movie when Arwen appears to take Frodo to Rivendell where bilbo gifts it to him. &nbsp;This is a small gripe that fans may have, but in my case I was delighted. &nbsp;I decided to get this set first, purely because it contained Frodo AND Sting AND the Ring. This was a plus for my first Lord of the Rings set!</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><i>Aragorn (Strider)</i></div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11151-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11153-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Aragorn is the only minifigure in this set who doesn't come with a cloak, but that's ok, I wasn't expecting him to anyway. &nbsp;He has a double sided face, one expression shows his neutral face and the other shows a fierce fighting face (both faces have stubble a plenty) He also sports a Prince of Persia like hairstyle, which makes him a look a little similar to Dastaan, but as I dont own Dastaan, or a Prince of Persia set, that is ok! His torso printing is lovely (he even features Arwen's Evenstar, which again is inaccurate to this set as he doesn't recieve this until the scene in Rivendell on the bridge. It may have been a little bit better if he didn't have this, but it doesn't bother me very much.) &nbsp;This figure comes with a sword which is the same as the Ring Wraiths but lighter in colour. he also comes with the flame he sports during the fight in the movie. &nbsp;Again this minifigure is identical to another Aragorn you get in the Battle of Helms Deep set (set 9474) but it really doesn't bother me, it's not like it's the case of Richard the Strong all over again where you got him in nearly EVERY set!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><i>Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry)</i>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11147-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11148-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Merry is the other Hobbit figure in this set and sports a yellowish cloak. He has the same hair as Frodo, just a different colour (which is the same for all the fellowship hobbits, and Bilbo anyway). He has a double sided face, one expression shows a cheeky wee grin, close to that of Han Solo's and the other side shows an angry fighting face. &nbsp;His torso also has backprinting and has a lovely design on it (even the waistcoat has detail). &nbsp;Merry also sports a small sword. <b><i>This is the only set you can get Merry in.</i></b></div><div><br></div><div><i>The Ringwraith (Nazgul)</i></div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11143-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11149-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In this set you get two Ringwraiths which in my opinion is great, I know many would have expected 5 as seen in the scene in the film, but this would have bumped up the price, and there is still potential for some more to be released in the future so we may indeed get all nine! The hood, legs and head of the figure is nothing new, we've seen these pieces before countless times, but the torso, which again is highly detailed, is brand new. The torso even has backprinting, but I think the feature that makes these figures are the new horses and the cloaks they wear. &nbsp;The Cloaks are excellent, and have been designed to make them flow outwards, which is great! There are a few holes in the cloak to make it look old and tattered. &nbsp;The horses, which have the brand new hinged legs feature, are both fantastic, even though they are identical. They even have red eyes and a silver harness printed on the face, which looks brilliant! &nbsp;The Ringwraiths themselves come with dark swords which are perfect for them albeit inaccurate. (but all the people who are really bothered by the can easily bend the hilt so it's accurate, but I'm not going to bother). <b><i>This is the only set (currently) in which you can get them.</i></b></div><div><br></div><h4>The Set as a Whole</h4><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11154-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>The look of the set is superb, it features the campfire where they made the food and even comes with some food to cook! It has a spiral staircase leading up to the top of the model, which is again a lovely feature! Any Lord of the Rings fan who looks at this set will recognise what it is and what scene it's depicting, even if it is a little on the small side. &nbsp;The interior is also a nice feature as you've got somewhere to store the weapons and even the figures when you aren't playing with the set. &nbsp;Now we get to the real gripes I have with this set. &nbsp;This set features two, very ugly, flick-fire missiles. I've even tried them out, and they are rubbish, yes LEGO now put flick missiles into a lot of their sets, but that was a little out of order if I'm honest as they aren't really needed. &nbsp;There is also a trapdoor, which is a nice play feature but again, not needed. (however I love the way it clicks back shut with just a tap of the pin). Now to talk money. &nbsp;I said this to my Mum that this set was a little overpriced and she agreed with me, but doesn't regret letting me get it. Definately a little overpriced for a set like this, but it's understandable due to the new molds and the fact it's a licensed theme.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall however, this set is brilliant. It features 3 members of the Fellowship and also the famous Dark Riders. &nbsp;If you like Lord of the Rings and are looking for a set to start out with, this is the one in my opinion. &nbsp;You get the Ring (3 rings in fact) and Sting (a favourite with a lot of fans like myself) and you get two of the new horses to enjoy as well.</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://i769.photobucket.com/albums/xx331/dalekgor/SDC11162-1-1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div><b>now for my final ratings I'll give it:</b></div><div><br></div><div><b>KFOL</b> - <b>6/10</b> I don't think many KFOLs will want this set or watch Lord of the Rings in general but those who do want it and get it will like the set I think.</div><div><br></div><div><b>TFOL</b> - <b>8/10</b> I fall into this category and I think that this set is a perfect representation of the scene, but I do think it's overpriced.</div><div><br></div><div><b>AFOL</b> - <b>7/10</b> I think for the Adult collectors, this set is fantastic, however I've gone lower because of the overpriced nature of it and I think adults are more likely to buy this set at a reduced rate. For adult fans of the films and the sets, I think that this set is good, but not the one everyone will go for, unless they want the entire fellowship so to get merry they either buy this or buy him elsewhere for a large sum.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway I hope my review was some use to you all, and it's my first Lord of the Rings review and when I get the other sets, expect to see more from me!

"Telcontar","2013-01-12T22:03:30.187Z","The Ruin of Amon Sul","<p>While travelling to Rivendell Frodo, Strider, and the other hobbits were attacked on the ruin of Amon Sul, otherwise known as Weathertop.&nbsp; This was one of the most important and memorable scenes from the movie (and book).&nbsp; Likewise, this&nbsp;model is also one of the most important and best sets of its theme.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nicely made clearly displaying the action and drama of the scene with a fitting background behind.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection in this set are fantastic.&nbsp; We get lots of rare earth colors including dark green and dark tan.&nbsp; We also get several of the new engraved 1x2 bricks to make it look more weathered.&nbsp; However, in this set we get them in tan, unlike in the Helm's Deep and Uruk-hai Army sets.&nbsp; Also included are 4 solid light grey microfigures which look awesome as statues.&nbsp; Another rare addition are the winding staircase pieces.&nbsp; Some of my favorite pieces in this set though are the hinge pieces which come in abundance.&nbsp; They are used to give the structure its round shape.&nbsp; Plus all the minifig accessories are great too.&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Being a midsized set we get several minifigs, 5 to be exact.&nbsp; Like some of my other reviews I'll start with the good guys:</p><p><strong>Frodo:&nbsp; </strong>You can't really have a Weathertop set without him.&nbsp; Frodo comes in his brown suit jacket with a red vest and a green cape, accurate to the movie.&nbsp; He has a little back printing but nothing too incredibly exciting there.&nbsp; His head come double-sided.&nbsp; On one side we see his ""tired"" face while on the other we see his ""Ow, I've just been stabbed by a Morgul blade"" expression.&nbsp; His dark brown hair piece is the same one we get with Frodos in other sets.&nbsp; He comes with 3 One Rings as well as Sting.&nbsp; (Extra Note: At this point in the story Frodo didn't have Sting yet.&nbsp; Bilbo would later give it to him in Rivendell.&nbsp; LEGO should have given him a normal short sword)</p><p><strong>Aragorn (Strider): </strong>Aragorn looks suitably like the weather worn ranger that he his with his scruffy face and worn out clothes.&nbsp; His legs are printed to match his torso.&nbsp; There's a few printed wrinkles on the back but nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; His head is double-sided.&nbsp; One face is ""neutral"" while the other is his ""fighting"" face.&nbsp; Really close observers will notice that he has the necklace that Arwen would later give him.&nbsp; That really isn't 100% accurate but it's not worth printing a different one.&nbsp; He comes with a sword and a flaming torch to battle the Ringwraiths.</p><p><strong>Merry: </strong>Merry looks exactly like he did in the movie with his red hair, green jacket, and yellow waistcoat.&nbsp; If you look close you can see the printed designs in his waistcoat which looks fantastic.&nbsp; He has a double sided head like Frodo and Aragorn.&nbsp; One side is ""neutral"" while the other is ""fighting/scared"".</p><p><strong>Ringwraiths (Nazgul): </strong>The Ringwraiths are unique to this set and that makes Attack on Weathertop a must have for the LotR completest&nbsp;(Merry is also&nbsp;exclusive by the way).&nbsp; Their torso is a new print with folds in their black cloak as well as a belt (which is also black except for the buckle).&nbsp; On the back side of their torso are some more printed folds.&nbsp; Their heads are plain black (as they should be) and their hoods are too.&nbsp; But the really cool thing about these guys are their capes which are completely new.&nbsp; Unlike most LEGO capes these ones have three&nbsp;holes in them to make them more accurate as well as more scary.&nbsp; They're bigger too, instead of having two holes that slide on top of the torso there are three.&nbsp; Some complained that their hoods popped off from this and I experienced the same thing.&nbsp; However, having having them for a while I'm not experiencing that problem any more.&nbsp; They also come with a dark grey sword and a new black horse.&nbsp; LEGO has made these horses more menacing by printing&nbsp;red eyes on their head which&nbsp;stand out and look really cool.</p><p>...</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build itself is quite fun, especially when working on the round part of the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may have just been the lighting in the room but sometimes it was hard to tell apart the greens, greys, and blacks in the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I've built trap doors before this one was fun, mainly because it is built in a new way&nbsp;which works a lot better.&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model itself looks extremely well done, even though it is undersized.&nbsp; LEGO has added play features to it which are not accurate to the movie (or the books) but make it more appealing to younger kids.&nbsp; For the purist who may be concerned about this don't worry.&nbsp; You hardly notice the flick-fire missiles and the trap door pin can be easily covered up.&nbsp; In conclusion: This set is one of my favorites.&nbsp; It has great playability, wonderful minifigs, and works wonderfully as a display.&nbsp; There's just one problem.&nbsp; $60 (USD) is just way too much for only 430 pieces, as wonderful as they may be.&nbsp; $40 would have been better, $50 would have been OK, but $60?&nbsp; Too much.&nbsp; If it wasn't for the price this may have been one of my favorite sets.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is a great set, except for its price.&nbsp; It looks great and is lots of fun.&nbsp; If money is no object to you I wouldn't hesitate buying this set.&nbsp; But if money is an object I would still seriously consider getting it.</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"Mineninja101","2015-04-08T14:32:31.617Z","One Fateful Day","<p>I remember that Thursday in April 2013 so well. I had gone to Kroger with my family that day, I had brought about $30&nbsp; leftover from my Christmas money hoping to find some 2012 Ninjago sets on closeout. Little did I know that I would find something MUCH better. That Kroger was having a HUGE sale on toys from 2012 that never sold. Guess what I found for $15? Thats right! I bought Attack on Weathertop. I also bought for $11 set 5885: Triceratops Trapper.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was about one and a half inches thick with nice detail. The instructions were easy to read.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with many great parts. My favorite is the moving stairs part.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It comes with five minifigs, Two ringwraiths, Aragorn, Frodo, and Merry. The ringwraiths and Merry are exclusive to this set. Frodo you can get in almost every LOTR set and this is the cheapest set you can get Aragorn in.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took me about 45 min to build. It was a very challenging set to build. The hardest part was the curved section. The box says this is for children 8-14 but I would say more like 10-14.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Weathertop doesn&#39;t have many play features. The first feature is that you can open it up by pulling it apart at the sides. It&#39;s easy to open, but not so easy to close. The second feature is the flick fire missiles that you flick from the inside. The third feature is the the trap door this is my favorite one. You put a minifig on the two green 1x4 plates, pull the brown nob on the front, and the minifig falls on to a weapons rack inside Weathertop. That has got to hurt!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great LOTR set for older builders I would not recommend it&nbsp; kids under ten years of age. This is my first review on Brickset, I just got an account yesterday. I hope this review is helpful and I plan to make more reviews of sets from my collection.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-09-14T07:19:12.217Z","Possibly the best of the LOTR sets","<p>So I&rsquo;ve been so impressed with the few Lord of the Rings sets that I own that when I found a bunch of sets for sale at a quarter of the original retail price (they were missing minifigures), I just had to snatch them up. Of the sets I got, it was this one that I had the lowest expectations for given its smaller size, but wow did this set surprise me.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>So this is the only set to contain Merry and I do wish I had him. However I have several Bilbo&rsquo;s and Frodo&rsquo;s, plus a Samwise, so it is easy to use them to round out my fellowship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aragon I already have from other sets, and he does look great. The Frodo in this set is unique, but I have several other Frodo&rsquo;s, including one with a cape, that missing this one isn&rsquo;t too big of a deal. As for the Ring Wraiths, all I had to do is put an all black head on Emporer Palpatine and I have a very believable Ring Wraith. The horse I also have from a few other sets, and while they look similar to the horses from the 80&rsquo;s, their rear legs bend allowing them to stand which is really cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>this set sure does have a lot of useful parts. First up, you get 4 all gray microfigures to use as statues. You also have a pot and lots of food for Merry to cook. A good collection of weapons. But the best part is probably all of the hinges that come with this set, and there are a lot! Plus you get a spiral staircase, which is always fun to have.</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>This is what this set is all about. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever done a more complex build than this one. The way that hinges are used to create the curves is absolutely brilliant and looks fantastic. I&rsquo;ve used hinges for round construction before, but I think it must be the height of the curved walls that most impressed me. Yes, they may be a little repetitive, but you won&rsquo;t even notice that since you will be so amazed by how this little set was designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combine this with a boatload of details and the spiral staircase and this build is just pure fun from start to finish. More importantly, it&rsquo;s the kind of build that you can learn a lot from.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>The set is an excellent interpretation of Weathertop, it looks very true to the movie, and while it could have been a little bigger, it&rsquo;s size seems very appropriate. The Little Rock and bush that is separate seems rather unnecessary, I feel like it was thrown in simply so they could justify a higher price for the set, but it can fit in nicely with any other LOTR set that is set in a natural place (Attack of the Wargs, Mirkwood Elves...)</p>

<p>But of course what you don&rsquo;t see from the pictures is all the play features, and while none of them are true to the movie, they are sort of there out of necessity, filling in empty real estate below the mountain. This is a big reason why this set works so well, there is room under the mountain.</p>

<p>There is a trap door activated by pulling out a pin that works great. I have several of these with Indiana Jones sets that always seemed to have too much friction, but this one works perfectly, dropping a minifigure onto an arsenal of weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, if a minifigure can fall inside, then you can also open it up to get them out. When you do this you are presented with a sort of cave filled with weapons (perhaps Bilbo&rsquo;s troll cave). There is a flick fire missile which seems very misplaced, but it blends in and is very easy to simply ignore it. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult getting it to close again, aligning the technic pin with the hole is not easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>The highlight of this set is without a doubt the build, which is saying a lot given it is a very nice looking model. For me there is nothing more fun than building a set, and perhaps it is due to the smaller size of this set cramming in such a complex design, that the build keeps you excited the whole time and never gets tedious. I have built more complex functions using technic, but for standard bricks, I&rsquo;ve never seen a better build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can get your hands on this set, do it. Lord of the Rings is easily becoming my favorite Lego line, and while I don&rsquo;t own Helms Deep or Isengard yet, this in my opinion is the absolute best set!</p>
