I simply can't recall another set with as many decals as this one; even &nbsp;the design on the book located next to the dwarf tomb is a decal. Blast.&nbsp;<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>On a more positive note, the minifigures are the crown jewels of this set. The details of the torso and leg designs are intricate and crisp, and Lego goes the extra mile here by printing designs not only on the back torsos of Legolas, Gimli, and the orcs, but by printing double face designs on every character, excluding of course the troll and the skeletons. Unfortunately, the second face expression of the orks is kind of pointless because the two expressions are so similar. The only difference is that one side of the face appears to be a bit more ravenous for hobbit flesh than the other. And in case you were wondering about the elf and ork ears, they're attached to the hairpiece, not the head.</p><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The set itself is comprised of four main parts: the well, the tomb, the barricaded door, and a sort of stage with collapsing pillars. The well is a simple but nice addition that allows the skeleton to fall within by pulling a plank out the side of the well. The plank is slightly clumsy, so it doesn't take much for a ""Fool of a Took"" like Pippin to knock the skeleton in. A plank is also used in the tomb to pry open the lid and reveal a skeleton, and I suggest pressing down forcefully on the plank to ensure the lid is removed properly. However, it would have been interesting if the skeleton had been crafted to dwarf size to increase the accuracy of the set, if only by a little. The doors of the entranceway are sturdy, and it appears that the inscription directly above the doors is the same one that Frodo translates to gain entrance in the film. A part of one side of the entranceway can also collapse by pressing a lever that lifts the portion of the wall away when it catches a jutting piece. The stage area is the largest portion of the set and is constructed by sliding three portions together. The middle section is hollow at the bottom allowing a chest of diamonds and a gold crystal to be pushed out by another sliding plank. The two bordering sections feature pillars that collapse when levers located beneath them are depressed in the back of the stage.&nbsp;</div><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>In a world when the 1/10 price/piece ratio no longer applies that often, I suppose that the price could be considered a decent one. After all, the set does include seven new weapon pieces that include a hook contraption, an axe, a mace, a sword, a small bow and arrow, and two small knives. But those blamed decals are enough to drive anyone as raving mad as the ring does to Gollum.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Energyarrow","2012-07-13T11:54:07.057Z","Exclusive Minifigures, Useful Pieces, Great Design - and $80? This Set Has its Flaws...","<p>One of Lord of the Rings' most memorable scenes has been made into Legos.&nbsp; Who could forget the frightening cave-troll, or the epic bridge crossing, or the wonderfully animated Durin's&nbsp;Bane? I can answer that question... your wallet! Reenacting your favorite scene doesn't come cheap.</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>The Mines of Moria is composed of four main parts: one wall, the doors, a well, and a coffin for the king of dwarves.&nbsp; Heroica weapons are also included to spread around the floor, which makes for a nice setup, even if these tiny weapons are too small to function in a battle.</p>
<p>The well is&nbsp;a nice design, but putting the skeleton on it and then wrapping him up with the bucket/chain can prove quite&nbsp;difficult.&nbsp; I actually attatch the chain's stud to the skeleton's foot, which makes it much easier to stay together.&nbsp; Then you can pull the slide and... there goes Mr. Dwarf, here comes drums in the deep!</p>
<p>The coffin is also a nice design, although its launch feature doesn't work very well.&nbsp; If you apply a very quick, hard force on it, the coffin lid will at least partially fall off - or move - but that's about it.&nbsp; If you take the lid<em>, then</em> launch the late dwarf, he goes very far.</p>
<p>The doors are very thick and make a good barricade.&nbsp; Around the actual doors, there are stickers that provide detail - cobwebs, and some orcs peeking through the dark.&nbsp; Also a&nbsp;feature that pushes part of the wall off, and some places to put weapons and torches (one torch and a spear included).</p>
<p>The main wall, which appears to hold books and is some type of library, has a device in which you can push a treasure filled chest out from inside a little cave.&nbsp; Both pillars fall off of a black base.&nbsp; For some unknown reason the sides of this part are left open, and so is the back - clearly meant to be left unseen.&nbsp; You have a bone, diamond, bottle, and book to scatter around; also a bucket holding a pick-axe and a spear that have certain places to go.</p>
<p><strong>Minfigures</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set includes two Moria orcs, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, Pippin, and a cave troll.&nbsp; The two Moria orcs have detailed shirts and a rather queer switch-face.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One side is a snarl, the other a sneer - both are hardly different.&nbsp; I just give one orc the snarl and one the sneer, so you can distinguish which one is which.&nbsp; But not easily.</p>
<p>Boromir has the typical switch-face, as does Legolas and Gimli.&nbsp;&nbsp;All are very detailed,&nbsp;and I&nbsp;particularly like Legolas' hair.&nbsp; Gimli's helmet is modified to go over his beard, so on a regular minifigure it's short.&nbsp; The axe included is also too large for him, so I just use the smaller one.&nbsp; Boromir's shield is nice, and Pippin has a mini cape.</p>
<p>The cave-troll was a delight.&nbsp; Yes, it comes in its own back (indicating Chinese origin), but boy is it huge! It's larger than the wampa from&nbsp;Star Wars, and is made of seven pieces: two hands, two pieces to attatch the hands to the arms, two arms, a the main body.&nbsp; You also&nbsp;put a chain&nbsp;on, and a large club which throws the troll off balance.&nbsp; You have to position it up&nbsp;high in the air or touching the ground to keep him from falling over.&nbsp; Stink.</p>
<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>
<p>There's not really a point in listing all the pieces, so I'll keep it short.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;parts are mainly basic, grey building&nbsp;bricks and light gray tiles that are great for building castles or anything for that matter - as long as it's not colorful.</p>
<p>However, there is a major throw back (hence the four stars in pieces)...&nbsp;EVERY DESIGN IS&nbsp;A STICKER.&nbsp; There&nbsp;is a large sheet of stickers,&nbsp;which cover the walls and interior.&nbsp; Even the book is&nbsp;covered with&nbsp;two stickers.&nbsp; This, of course, does not include the minifigures.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Ok, this&nbsp;is a great set, but it does have its flaws: a cave-troll that doesn't balance, a huge amount of stickers, and a&nbsp;not very fair price.&nbsp; Yes, it is very brick dense, but Lego should cover for appearence too.&nbsp; Once the whole thing is built, it looks more like a 70$ or even 60$&nbsp;set.&nbsp; 'Back in my day', you could get, say 7621 for 80 bucks.</p>

"Almaras","2012-06-10T01:55:23.297Z","Held back by a sheet of stickers ","<font size=""4""><p>Wow. Just wow. This is set is almost perfect, and would be if it weren’t for one thing. Actually, 34 small, hard to place and even harder to place perfectly, stuck for eternity things. The stickers. They are the only thing that hold this set back, and I just don’t understand it. At least 18 of them could have been printed, like in other sets. What has Lego come to when not even the book is spared from the agony of stickers, when there are books in, say, Harry Potter sets that have wonderful printing? But the stickers are only one small downfall in an epic set, so I’ll move on.</p>
<p>To make it easier, I’ll focus on the different constructions in the order they were built, which means the well is up first. The well itself is quite good. It’s a suitable size and is of decent construction, but has three stickers. When it came to placing the skeleton wrapped in the chain attached to a bucket, I had trouble getting it all to balance. Once it was balanced, although still dodgy, I would pull out the support to send it all crashing down to awaken the drums in the deep, only more often than not the skeleton got caught on the support and would stay clinging to it or flip over the side and land at Pippin’s feet instead. Until I removed the two 1x1 cheese slopes at the end and all my problems were fixed. The skeleton had a place to sit properly, which allowed the bucket to balance, and when it came down they all fell down the mighty three-brick-deep oblivion, never to be seen again. Until I wanted to do it again.</p>
<i><p>Balin son of Fundin. Lord of Moria.</p></i><p> To look at, Balin’s tomb is quite impressive. The ruins on top are straight out of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, which is a nice touch. But there are two issues I have with it, excluding the non-dwarf sized skeleton. Firstly, the lid doesn’t fit properly. The width is perfect, but the length is one stud too long. I know that stud is needed for it to be even, but it means the lid moves. A lot. And the second problem isn’t something I actually have a problem with, but it goes against what Lego has said, in that hitting the lever to send Balin’s skeleton up to knock the lid away doesn’t work. If I hit the lever hard enough the lid will shudder, which would be enough to creep you out, but the lid isn’t pushed off. The dwarves book of records is also included with the tomb. It is a fine book and looks great, as long as the stickers are placed carefully and exactly. </p>
<p>Next is the doorway that the cave troll can bash his way through. I never thought I’d be impressed by a doorway, but Lego has proven me wrong. The doorway is very solid, which is great. There are some fantastic details, such as the ruins above the door, which I translated to: ""Diordie Was Here"". I’m not sure who Diordie was, or if that’s even correct, but I thought it was a great touch that he took the time to write that he was here. The doors are cool with their wood detailing. If you push on the doors the axe holding them shut will eventually flick up with potential eye hitting force, but I guess that’s part of the security measures. At least there are no flick-fire missiles. The final part of the doorway is a level that lifts up part of the wall to simulate the cave troll bashing his way in. This works as expected and can even crush a well-placed orc.</p>
<p>Finally there is the, umm, I’m not sure what to call it so I’ll go with the stage, where Legolas can perform and show off his awesome archery skills. Before I had this set and could do nothing but drool over the pictures, I was excited to see a certain ruin on the spine of one of the books, the ruin Tolkien says in the Hobbit represents a hidden door. My imagination took that and went crazy, so I was quite eager to see how this hidden door worked, but alas there is no door. Just a fancy, yet fixed, bookshelf. Luckily there is a lot more to this stage to hold my disappointment at bay. I’ll start with the treasure, because everyone loves treasure. You can push from the back and slide the treasure chest forwards. Inside there is some gold and a couple of jewels, so you can’t really go wrong there. The second feature is really quite cool. The two pillars can be released by a lever at the back and fall forwards in a last attempt to crush the cave troll. On the stage are a couple of torches, a skull and a single bone, a barrel holding a pick-axe, another jewel, an old bottle, a book and a spear in a stand.</p>
<p>Those are all the constructions, but the best is yet to come. Introducing: Legolas, Boromir, Pippin, Gimli, two Moria Orcs and a freaking cave troll! Legolas has two faces, a serious face and an angry face. His hair piece is really detailed, even including plats down his back, and of course, the pointed ears. He has his bow, but unfortunately, due to his long hair, he can’t have a quiver. I will be trying to find a cape for him though, because I think the whole fellowship should have their capes. Boromir as a minifig is awesome. The colours of his torso and legs are great and his shield is just perfect. His face and hair piece are the coolest, though. Even if his serious face does remind me more of Eddie Izzard than Sean Bean. Pippin has been translated into a minifig well – you can almost see him trembling as the cave troll approaches. The blue torso is great (it’s good to see he and Boromir are colour co-ordinated!) and I love that he has his scarf. You can’t help but feel bad for him when he has his scared face. Gimli looks even shorter holding his double bladed axe, but once he is standing on Balin’s tomb he is ready to take anything on. His helmet is brilliant, as is his beard. But I found it interesting that he has a double sided head, considering all you can see is his eyebrows and eyes. The two Orcs are identical, apart from their weapons of choice. Someone is clearly the favourite, though, because only one of them has a shield. Granted, the other has a cave troll, but that could be more of a liability. They have two faces, one with a slightly more open mouth than the other, but very little difference. Their hair pieces are the same as Legolas’, with the ears attached. But the cave troll steals the scene. He is massive! His arms spin all the way around, and his hands rotate likewise. The club is great, but must be too heavy for him because it pulls him over unless it is above his head. But my favourite feature is that he can hold a minifig by a leg, which is just awesome. (But again, only above his head so that he can balance.)</p>
<p>And that’s about it. The set also comes with a weapons pack to be scattered around, which is a great added detail and I think it really makes the set when it is on display. Despite the couple of let downs (*cough* stickers *cough*), this is a fantastic set and one that everyone should get. It looks great on display, yet still has tons of playability. </p></font>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

Rex in my son's 5886, which has pivoting legs, arms, tail, and jaws, plus a head that moves in 2 dimensions). &nbsp;Worse, the balance on the troll is off, so he wants to tumble forward, even more so with his club in his hand. &nbsp;He really needs legs that can be moved (as does the Hulk, but that's another set/story...)</div><div><br></div><div>With regard to the play set, the ""fool of a Took!"" well was really disappointing. &nbsp;The mechanism to allow the skeleton/chain/pail to fall in simply doesn't work well - it is too bulky to get out of the way, and there is hardly enough room for the skeleton, etc. in the well as it is. &nbsp;Balin's tomb is a little better, but the mechanism requires a perfect hit to spring the top in a satisfying way, something which my kids find elusive. &nbsp;(I actually had the same nitpicky thought as the previous reviewer, about Balin's skeleton being too large - geek minds think alike!) The ""collapsing"" section of the wall next to the doors mechanistically works very well, but it just seems arbitrary; a piece of wall that just falls off for no good reason. &nbsp;In the movie scene, the troll burst through the doorway (although I appreciate modeling a collapsing doorway might have been hard to get just right.) &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I feel like the level of creativity that goes into the little moveable parts of kits like these is often suboptimal; lots of the little tricks and movement elements I've seen on MOC websites and at the one Lego enthusiast show I attended surpass the ones used in the kits. &nbsp;Sometimes I feel like Lego's passion isn't in it - it is as if Lego designs cool looking pieces and sets, and then they add on these half-baked little mechanisms to recreate some scene from the movie. &nbsp;Designing a well with a simple yet satisfying ""trap door"" style mechanism does not seem too much to ask. &nbsp;That said, the twin&nbsp;falling towers work well and have simple, easy-to-use-and-understand mechanisms.</div><div><br></div><div>OK, so for my first review, this one has been pretty gripe-y, and probably my expectations were simply unreasonably high! &nbsp;Still looking forward to all the other LotR / Hobbit sets to come...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,2,3
"Telcontar","2013-01-13T14:38:37.167Z","""Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria""","<p>Finally after years of waiting we get this famous scene from the movie in LEGO!&nbsp; I think It is pretty well done, except for a couple minor flaws.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box for this set shows the characters in action frighting the orcs and cave troll.&nbsp; When I opened the box it seemed like it was a little over sized but that's not too big of an issue to me.&nbsp; You get two instruction manuals.&nbsp; The first one contains directions for the gate, Balin's tomb, and the hole that Pippin tips the skeleton into.&nbsp; The second covers that back main wall with the collapsing pillars.&nbsp; Just as a note, it's not obvious from the box of the second instruction manual, but on instruction book 1 you can see that the background is actually the same one used in Shelob Attacks, the Stairs of Cirith Ungol which really isn't accurate at all.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In this set you get a lot of dark grey bricks which make up most of the set.&nbsp; But you do get some light grey and black as well.&nbsp; 19 of those dark grey bricks are the new ""profile"" bricks with the engravings on them to make them look more weathered.&nbsp; Plus there are tons of minifig pieces which are great.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Being a large sized set you get a fair number of minifigs.&nbsp; Like my other reviews I'll start with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Legolas: </strong>Being one of the most popular figures from the movie fans eagerly awaited the release of this minifigure.&nbsp; I'm glad to say he does not disappoint.&nbsp; His printing is fantastic, accurately representing the elf we saw in the movie.&nbsp; His leg printing is pretty good to which is a continuation of his top garments.&nbsp; He also has quite a bit of back printing even though you don't see it under the back of his hair.&nbsp; He also comes with a new bow mold which suits him much better than the old one would have.&nbsp; Back to his hair, some have complained about it because it doesn't leave room for a quiver.&nbsp; I actually like the hair piece he comes with quite a lot contrary to what other may think.&nbsp; I'm more concerned with his face.&nbsp; LEGO added lines on his cheek which doesn't really look like Legolas to me.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Pippin: </strong>Since Pippin is the one who sets this scene in motion I think it was a good choice for LEGO to include him.&nbsp; He comes with his blue jacket and scarf which, by the way, is excellently done.&nbsp; There's a little back printing but like other hobbits, isn't too exciting, especially since his light green cape covers it up.&nbsp; He comes with a double face, one side is ""neutral"" while the other is ""scared"".&nbsp; His hair is like most hobbits only in light brown.</p><p><strong>Gimli: </strong>The minifig that LEGO has made for Gimli may be my favorite of the theme, and that's sayin' a lot.&nbsp; His beard piece, which makes up most of him, is fantastic on the front and the back.&nbsp; LEGO included all the braids, lines, and everything.&nbsp; His head is double sided but when you put him together you can't tell the difference except for his eyebrows which go from ""normal"" to ""angry"".&nbsp; His torso is amazing, from his belt and his tunic to the chain mail that shows at the top.&nbsp; His back is even more incredible with lots of detail.&nbsp; But the most astounding thing about this is that we never see it!&nbsp; It's all covered up by his immense beard!&nbsp; LEGO could have gone cheap on this guy but they didn't and I'm incredibly glad about that.&nbsp; Well done LEGO!&nbsp; One last thing I haven't mentioned yet is his helmet.&nbsp; All the lines are so accurate and clearly depict the dwarves' nature.&nbsp; I was so amazed I went back and watched part of the movie.&nbsp; Then I was even more impressed because <em>all of the lines and designs match the movie perfectly!&nbsp; </em>All in all I would buy this (or Helm's Deep) just for him alone!&nbsp; But fortunately I don't have to do that since there are lots of other great elements too.</p><p><strong>Boromir: </strong>Boromir, heir to the Stewardship in Gondor is also great in minifig form.&nbsp; The detail and colors are very well done.&nbsp; In this scene he's wearing his dark red shirt with an extra dark blue vest/light armour thing (I can't remember the name for it at the moment).&nbsp; His leg printing is a continuation of this and matches up with his torso perfectly.&nbsp; On the back is a little more printing but nothing impressive.&nbsp; He comes with a brown cape, a sword, and a specially printed round shield which is accurate to the move.&nbsp; His face is double sided.&nbsp; One expression is ""neutral"" while the other is ""angry/fighting"".&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Moria Orc(s): </strong>Every good battle scene has to have a villain(s).&nbsp; This set comes with two orcs, Moria orcs to be exact which are a little different from other orcs and I'm glad LEGO distinguished them by using a green color (which is accurate to the movie).&nbsp; Their legs are plain dark grey with a black belt.&nbsp; Their torso is a different story though.&nbsp; The armor is (again) very well done and is very ""orkish"" to say the least.&nbsp; Their heads are double sided but both faces are extremely similar.&nbsp; The main difference are the wrinkles between the eyes.&nbsp; That is still hardly noticeable and I've seen lots of reviewers overlook it.&nbsp; That part about them seems strange but I guess it's for people who don't want to have two of the exact same minifig.&nbsp; Their hair is like the elf ones except that their ears are more rough and stick more plus their hair is cut unevenly short.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Cave Troll: </strong>I wouldn't normally label this guy as a minifig but if Brickset does I guess I can too.&nbsp;:-)&nbsp; He is a great replica from the movie with the grey spots on his back to the lines and shape of his head, and even to his 4 grey toes.&nbsp; With his roaring, open mouth he looks quite terrifying, for a LEGO piece that is. ;-)&nbsp;&nbsp;There's just one problem with him, he's unstable.&nbsp; If you take his club away he's fine but with it he won't stand up, unless you put him on a baseplate.&nbsp; The only way he'll stand up with his club is if he holds it above or behind his head.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty fun, maybe not quite so exciting since you're mainly building walls but it was enjoyable nevertheless.&nbsp; The main problem with this build (as many have pointed out) are the stickers which come in abundance.&nbsp; I don't think any other LotR has more than this one so people who&nbsp;don't like&nbsp;stickers beware!&nbsp; But they look nice when put on well.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished the model looks pretty nice.&nbsp; It doesn't have that awe factor like some other sets but it still looks impressive.&nbsp; I don't think it works as well as a model but it has tons of playability with all the minifigs and play features.&nbsp; Speaking of play features most of them work well.&nbsp; The hole that Pippin knocks the skeleton down is the worst.&nbsp; It's hard to set up and then most of the time it doesn't work properly.&nbsp; The other problem spot is Balin's tomb.&nbsp; But this can be fixed by putting his legs straight up in the air, then it works very well.&nbsp; The gate part of the model feels quite a bit bigger than it looks in the pictures.&nbsp; It and the other wall are very dwarvish with their crystalline, geometric shapes which is pretty easy to do in LEGO.&nbsp; I haven't mentioned this yet but it comes with lots of extra weapons which&nbsp;is a nice addition.&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all I like this set.&nbsp; The minifigs are superb, (most of) the play features work well, and there are lots of good bricks for building.&nbsp; But I still don't think it's my favorite of the theme, even with all the great features.&nbsp; The cost isn't too bad,&nbsp; $80 (USD), but it could have been better.&nbsp; This has tons of play opportunities for kids and it's a must have for LotR fans&nbsp;since all the minifigs (except Gimli) are exclusive.&nbsp; It doesn't work as well as a display&nbsp;though with all the loose parts and structures, but it could be&nbsp;managed.&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-06T20:59:25.883Z","They Made a Cave Troll","<p><strong>Set #9473 The Mines of Moria: </strong>The Lord of the Rings Theme is just chock full of great sets there are very few stinkers in the bunch, and this set is no exception. It's a great set with certain members of the Fellowship that are not available in any other sets. (Though Gimli and Legolas have appeared in other sets by now.)</p>
<p>The second most expensive set this one recreates a very familiar scene from Fellowship the discovery of the Tomb of Balin (A member of Thorin's Dwarven Company) it's a brilliant set with a host of Mini-Figs I shall now delve into the reasons this set is such a great one.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box for this set is pretty large. It includes an image of the set showing off all of the features quite impressively on the front and back, it also gives us a handy checklist for all of the Mini-Figs found in the set by name on the front however it doesn't include two hidden characters that LEGO often doesn't consider proper Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>The instructions in this box are protected in a large bag with a cardboard backing, the piece of cardboard is larger than the Instructions for better protection, there is also a sticker sheet. You have two sets of instructions in thie set, numbers 1 and 2 which splits the build up between the four numbered bags. The first manual not only has the steps to build three sections of the model, but also includes the Mini-Figure checklist for all the Lord of the Ring sets and an image of The Battle of Helm's Deep, as well as a sneak peek saying that The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey sets will be available later in the year.</p>
<p>The second manual is where you'll find the piece list and a promo for the Lord of the Rings Video Games. Both manuals are quite nice, suitably thick and with easy to follow steps for the build.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are a lot of nice pieces in this set chief among them is the 19 sculpted brick 1x2 bricks, the brown pail with handle and two long chains. It's a great set for parts and I think a few MOCers out there would agree with me.</p>
<p>I also love the Brick Seperator, it's a very useful tool and I've gotten a decent number of them this past year. I kind of wish LEGO would make them in more than just orange for the colour, still I can understand it would be cheaper to stick with one colour for the tool.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are 9 Mini-Figures in this set, two of which are not named on the box because... Well they aren't characters from Lord of the Rings. So we'll mention them first.</p>
<p>Skeletons, yep there are two old school LEGO&nbsp;Skeletons in this set, the kind that use the older arm attaching feature without the c-clips, but the floppy loose armed ones. Not really much to say about them, they're bonus Mini-Figures that are in the set and count towards your Mini-Figure collection, but there's not much to say about&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Moria Orc: These pair of Orcs have identical prints and look quite nice actually. They use the long black&nbsp;hair piece with ears that most Orc use, they have double-sided torso prints matching the armour worn by the Orcs of Moria and also have double-sided facial prints. The problem is that the faces are so similar it's hard to tell&nbsp;if this is a good thing, I mean the expressions are nearly the same, the only difference is that one side has a closed mouth the other&nbsp;open. One of them has the nice new Uruk-Hai/Orc shield piece and a large scimitar for weapons, the other uses that flail piece from Ninjago and I still think this is a terrible looking weapon to give to Orcs from The Lord of the Rings. (I just don't think that these weapons existed in Middle-Earth)</p>
<p>Legolas has a different print from his Hobbit Mini-Fig, this print is a double-sided torso with leg printing that matches his outfit from the three LotR films quite nicely. He also has a long hair piece, the same one we've seen on all elves and he has a double-sided face (one side neutral the other angry and prepared for battle). His bow is a brand new piece for LEGO&nbsp;different from the&nbsp;original Castle Theme&nbsp;longbow. I think the only real flaw in this Mini-Figure is the fact that his hair piece prevents him from also wearing a quiver, unfortunate though not the worst thing. This figure I believe is also in Pirate Ship Ambush, originally it was only available in this set which meant that you needed it to complete your Fellowship.</p>
<p>Gimli the Dwarf as the first Dwarf from Middle-Earth in Mini-Figure form looks really impressive, he has a large two-handed&nbsp;double-bladed axe and a much smaller single bladed axe for accessories. His torso is double-sided&nbsp;and he also has a double-sided facial print. The best aspect of him is his unique beard and helmet pieces, they look great and I love the detail put into the helmet's sculpt. It looks&nbsp;just like the one from the movies. He's not a rare Mini-Figure either, you could find him in this set, The Battle of Helm's Deep and the 2013 Pirate Ship Ambush and Council of Elrond sets. He's a great looking Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>Peregrine Took or Pippin for short is another great looking Hobbit figure who shares the exact same hair sculpt as all the rest. This time it's a lighter shade of brown than Frodo's. He's wearing a short green cape,&nbsp;has a nice double-sided torso print, a&nbsp;very familiar sword accessory (many other characters have used it as well from both film series' Themes.) and has a happy or terrified expression on his double-sided face. I think the best aspect of&nbsp;this Mini-Figure is actually the scarf printed around his torso's neck.</p>
<p>Boromir is an awe inspiring Mini-Figure, the ill fated member of the Fellowship comes complete with double-sided torso and facial printings, leg printing, the new round shield accessory with printing on it also and the new sword piece. He's also wearing a nice long rich coloured cape which we haven't seen before. Boromir is a great looking Mini-Figure, his hair piece is shared with Prince Dastan, Thor and other characters now, this is the only version of it in this particular orange/reddish toned colour.</p>
<p>The final character/Mini-Figure in this set is the superbly detailed excelently scaled Cave Troll, with bulky looking arms, tree trunk like legs and broad muscled shoulders this menacing creature from the depths of Moria looks suitably impressive. My only complaint is that his buildable club is such a massive accessory that it tends to send him toppling forward whenever you try to raise it so much as a milimeter above his head, he can't even move his arm a tiny bit to bring it up otherwise he'll become too top heavy and unbalance. A shame, still it is nice to have such a great detailed looking brute of a creature that is capable of carrying Mini-Figures in his hands.</p>
<p>A great cast of Mini-Figures with this set, the highlights of which are Boromir, Legolas, Gimili, the Cave Troll and to a lesser extent Pippin.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set features 4 numbered bags and each bag builds something stand alone, for the most part, bags 3 and 4 are connected via Technic pins to make up one whole section of Balin's Tomb's room, but each component is built seperately and self contained.</p>
<p>This makes for a fast, simple build in spite of having over 750 pieces in this set, each model is built one step at a time and when complete put aside until the end. There are a lot of stickers for detail, certain stonework detailing and Dwarvish script is all printed on stickers which are then placed on the bricks, this is unfortunate as it would have been something else to see actual printed LEGO pieces with Dwarvish script. There's even a pair of stickers for a LEGO book piece, most unfortunate, when I remember that Harry Potter sets used to include printing on their books and now the same piece is useing stickers instead. Ah well.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This is truly a play set style LEGO set, it does not have a large baseplate, there are no real structures here, instead you build up set pieces for Mini-Figures to interact with. The first such model is the well inside the room, this includes one of the LEGO chain pieces to wrap around the Skeleton, so when Pippin touches it, it will fall into the well arousing the Orcs of Moria to their presence.</p>
<p>There's actually a slide-out piece that works as a play feature for the well, pull it out from under the loosely placed Skeleton/Chain and Well Bucket and it all comes crashing down inside the well. I find this feature a bit worthless honestly, for one thing the skeleton is so loosely placed and the chain and bucket weighs him down so much that it will fall off the well itself at the slightest provocation. A slightly bigger well might have helped stabilize this play feature a little bit better, unfortunately then it wouldn't match the look of the well in the scene.</p>
<p>Balin's Tomb is a nicely decorated little build who suffers from the lid being part of another play feature, this one works a little too well. You losely place the lid over the coffin and then when the Cave Troll smashes his club into one section it flips the lid up and sends the Skeleton inside flying through the air. This play feature is actually quite fun, the real problem I have is that if you're not careful when you pick up the coffin the lid will just come off and the coffin will tumble to the floor to become slightly in need of some repair work. (In other words you'll have to rebuild some of it.)</p>
<p>Bag 2 is where you find the familiar looking double-doors that our heroes bravely barred from entry, until the Cave Troll came smashing through bringing with it a legion of Orcs. Foul creatures. Er, anyway I like this build a whole lot, it's a big bulky door from a Dwarven culture and looks great, you also get a spare axe to slide between the door handles to try and keep it closed. Actually considering the size of the box I was pleasently surprised to see just how small this model actually is, it works great and doesn't take up nearly as much space on a shelf or kitchen counter as I thought it would.</p>
<p>The final model is a large section of the room with big collumns, a secret treasure stash and a bunch of LEGO Game weapon pieces to litter the floor with where dwarven warriors fell in battle. It's also where a good sized bulk of the stickers will go. I really like the look of this model, each side is asymetrical, meaning that while one side is still intact the other uses less pieces to show the crumbling nature of Moria, it is in disrepair and there's very little hope that the Dwarves will ever reclaim their lost kingdom.</p>
<p>The best feature of the model is the central colomns, designed with a play feature in mind these things will topple down when you press a technic handle dealie in the back... Er not sure on the official name for the part, sorry.</p>
<p>Really this whole set comes together quite nicely and even though it's just a series of stand alone models with no real baseplate or building/structure to keept them all together in one place, it's a pretty darn impressive one. A shame LEGO relied more on stickers for the details rather than printing.</p>
<p>You also get a bunch of set pieces to dress up this place, there are two book pieces, one of which get's stickers to look like the book Gandalf read from in the movie. There's a pick axe in a barrel, a glass bottle piece, the LEGO Games Heroica weapons, a spare Skeleton head (I really don't like when LEGO includes these to just have them lying around, they're easily lost then.) and a few jewel pieces and a gold crystal peiece that goes inside the treasure chest.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a really great set, it's loaded with great details the models all look spectacular and fit the scene quite accurately. I think the only real problems I have with the set are the large number of stickers for details and the fact that they gave us two Skeletons instead of Four Moria Orcs or at least replace one of the Skeletons with another Orc to fight. Then again considering the size of the Cave Troll perhaps more Orcs wouldn't have been possible.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 LotR sets are slowly being phased out at retail I'd say track this down if you don't already own it, it's a great looking set with very minor problems. I do wish that the Canadian Price was closer to the American one, still that's what Holiday sales are for, and back during November the set was on sale for a very nice price.</p>
<p>I kind of hope LEGO gives us more of the Mines in a future set, provided LotR isn't a dead Theme, we haven't heard any words yet about new sets for 2014, hopefully Toyfair will change all that. More Moria Orcs and a set with Gandalf fighting the Balrog at the Bridge of Kahzad-Dum would make for a great add-on to this set. (And I'm pretty sure I didn't spell that right.) Highly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"lkb57","2014-02-05T04:58:55.707Z","Cave Trolls, Goblins and One Amazing Set","<p>For me, this was the set I was most excited about when I first found out that TLC was releasing LOTR sets. Not only is the battle in Balin&#39;s Tomb <em>still</em> my favorite scene in the LOTR movies, but the set is chuckie-jam full of amazing minifigures. Plus, of course, there&#39;s the Cave Troll. And who wouldn&#39;t want to own a Lego Cave Troll?</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">Parts</span></p>

<p>Now, to be fair, there are a lot of stickers in this set. Personally, that doesn&#39;t bother me, in fact, I found that in this set, the stickers really enhanced the model. In particular, I really liked the stickers used to make the Book of Mazarbul . . . a little easter egg that really adds to the feel of the set. The stonework stickers and the wood stickers aslo helped accent the set. Call me crazy, but I liked them.</p>

<p>As far as parts go, there are a few standouts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The set comes loaded with minifigure accessories, including jewels, torches, books and more weapons than you can shake a stick at</li>
	<li>Less common nowadays, but still exciting, are the numerous gray 2x1&nbsp;&quot;brick mold&quot; bricks . . . you know, the ones that look like the side of a brick wall? Yeah, infinite uses with those babies</li>
	<li>Finally, the set comes with a ton of lesser-known slope and cheese pieces, again, a treasure trove for any castle builder&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As should be expected, the minifigures are fantastic all around. This set comes with 4 exclusives: Boromir, Pippin, and the Moria&nbsp;Orc (5 I guess, if you count the Cave Troll). Additionally, the set also includes Legolas (also available in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79008-1/Pirate-Ship-Ambush"">79008</a>) and Gimli (also found in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9474-1/The-Battle-Of-Helm-s-Deep"">9474</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79006-1/The-Council-of-Elrond"">79006</a>, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79008-1/Pirate-Ship-Ambush"">79008</a>). So if you&#39;re hoping to collect the entire Fellowship, this set is a must-purchase. All of the minifigures have double-sided faces (Legoals, Gimli and Boromir have angry/neutral expressions, Pippin has scared/confused expressions, and the Moria Orcs have angry/angrier faces). The printing is fantastic all around, with Boromir and Gimli&#39;s torsos being a particular highlight for me. The torso patterns for Legolas and Boromir&nbsp;are both continued on their legs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was a blast, with multiple parts of the set incorporating fun/challenging builds. Balin&#39;s tomb was particularly awesome&ndash;&ndash;more for it&#39;s importance to the scene than for anything else. Also enjoyable was the fact that TLC managed to include a lot of fun play features in the set, like collapsing walls, skeletons that tumble into wells, and hidden treasure chests.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set and Bag End are probably my two favorite Lego sets of all time. There are so many reasons to buy this set (minifigs, parts, collectibles, etc.), that I&#39;m finding it hard to narrow my focus down to anyone thing. In short: buy this, and fast.</p>
