I can use all those elves I hunted for!","Full Disclosure: &nbsp;I'm a pretty big fan of Tolkien's middle earth, so much so that before the LOTR sets were announced, I had been hoarding mini-figs and Castle/Kingdoms sets in hopes of building a MOC Helm's Deep.<div><br></div><div>But I'm happy to say that even though I never completed my project, this flagship set from the new LOTR theme is pretty much everything I wanted in a Helm's Deep model.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll start with the bad I guess: &nbsp;the price. &nbsp; I understand that the MSRP on this set is $129.99... &nbsp;which is pretty good for a 1368 piece set. &nbsp;However, since I had to buy this on sight, I was forced to deal with the Toys R Us mark-up. &nbsp; They had it for $159.99... &nbsp;and that kinda sucks. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But with that price you do get 8 minifigs, and pretty huge playset that has some interesting building techniques, neat details and fun play features.</div><div><br></div><div>Building things like the Hornburg, the archer slots and rounded Keep itself required techniques I never saw in any Castle/Kingdoms sets in the past... making this probably the most ""fun"" build of any medieval-ish set I've ever come across.</div><div><br></div><div>You get some unique parts as well with this set. &nbsp;I'm not sure what you call them... but the brick-facade... uh... bricks (?) along with the sand-green bricks give the set a weathered look, adding to it's authenticity. &nbsp; The minifigs themselves are unique in that the armor of Haldir, Gimli and Theoden have amazingly intricate details... while the new cannon-fodder Uruk-hai makes me laugh at all the money I wasted on Dragon and Lion knights the past couple years.</div><div><br></div><div>When all is complete, you find yourself with a sprawling playset loaded with details from the films such as Aragorn and Gimil's dwarf-tossing escapade, the blowing-up of the Deeping Wall, Gimil's climb of the Hornburg, etc. &nbsp; So as long as you've got the space, there's tons for us kids (old and young) to do with it.</div><div><br></div><div>No set is perfect though. &nbsp; As mentioned the TRU price is a joke, but you can get around that with patience. &nbsp;I felt that the Deeping Wall was too low, and too short. &nbsp;I understand that the Uruk-hai Army set (9471) lengthens it, but I'm almost FORCED to buy at least one (probably two) of them get a proper length... &nbsp;that's another $30 (or $60) on top of this set's price. &nbsp;Bummer.</div><div><br></div><div>The inner-keep is pretty empty, and a bit cramp, so recreating scenes from the film in there would be difficult.</div><div><br></div><div>All-in-all, &nbsp;this is without-a-doubt MY favorite castle-themed set I own right now. &nbsp;It looks great, plays well, and only makes me wish for more of the same. &nbsp; I will need to buy some additional sets so that I can properly use all my Elves and Peasant minifigures I've been stocking up on... &nbsp;and I will have to raise the wall a bit, &nbsp;but in the end, &nbsp;this will go down in Lego history as one of the ""must-have"" sets for ANY Castle-themed fan or LOTR fan!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"donutsftw","2012-05-25T11:29:38.583Z","The word ""epic"" is overused, but it's a fitting description","<p>I ordered this set and 9471 almost as soon as they became available from Lego, and awaited their arrival with great anticipation. Let me just say: They do not disappoint!<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>As you can imagine, the box is quite large, and the bags of parts fill almost the whole box. There's four instruction booklets, each for different sections of the castle, so if you're willing to let others build parts of your set, everyone can work on their own sections. The instructions and the few stickers that are included are in their own separate bag with a sheet of cardboard, so there's no real possibility of the stickers peeling or the instructions getting all messed up.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The selection of parts is fantastic: lots of 1x1s, 1x4s, and 1x2 tiles in sand green, a bunch of the new brick patterned 1x2s in light grey, and plenty of 1x1 and 1x2 ""cheese slopes"". There's also plenty of the angled 2x2 corner bricks and hinge bricks and plates in light grey, which I didn't have any of, but if you've got 10223 Kingdoms Joust, that probably won't be as big a draw. There's also a few large castle wall pieces, but they're mainly used in the inner keep and tower, and just looking at the finished model you might almost forget they're there, since the set doesn't feel like it was designed around them. The parts are broken up into 9 numbered bags, and there's no loose parts in the box, so if you're only opening one bag at a time, there's little chance of parts getting lost or not being able to find them when you need them. The set also includes one of the new orange brick separators, although it doesn't really seem necessary.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>8 minifigs (and a new horse!) feels pretty good for a set of this size. Aragorn, Gimli, and the Uruk-hai all look nice, although Aragorn looks rather plain in comparison to the others. Haldir and Theoden are exclusive to this set, and both of them look great. In particular, Theoden's armor and helmet are incredibly well-printed (as is Gimli's); I'm amazed at the level of detail Lego was able to include. Personally, I think I would have preferred to have one fewer Uruk-hai and a generic Rohan soldier in its place, but I suppose then the set wouldn't quite have the feeling of being heavily outnumbered by Uruks. There's also a ""Berserker Uruk-Hai"" which is unique to this set; he's got printing on the front and back of his torso and head, but compared to the other minifigs he's not very interesting.<br></p><p>As for the new horse, it's quite nice; the head has been slightly redesigned so that it's a little rounder and a more realistic shape, but this means that horse armor for the older horses doesn't fit. The barding does fit, but the horse can't rear back if it's wearing it, as its tail gets in the way.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The whole set took me about 3 hours to build. Even though several sections are constructed fairly similarly, the build is never too repetitive since the patterns of sand green and brick patterned pieces varies. Each section comes together pretty quickly, and looks nice on its own, so the time really flew for me while building. <br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Even without 9471 Uruk-Hai Army, the finished castle looks great from the front. The interior doesn't look as pretty, due to the parts used for the arrow slits being two studs thick while most of the walls are one stud thick. There's also nothing to connect the inner keep to the outer wall securely, the bridge between them simply rests on top of the ramparts of the outer wall. Each section of the castle is connected together with Technic pins near the bottom, and a few bricks at the top, so it's pretty easy to make some minor modifications and get a different layout if you want. The curved walls are nicely done, and there's very little wiggle room once they're finished. <br></p><p>The play features are a bit of a mixed bag though: The minifig catapult works well, and launches them right onto the causeway if there's no other minifigs in the way, so you can recreate Gimli and Aragorn's dwarf-tossing adventure easily. The exploding wall is pretty disappointing, however. Most of the time, the bottom part of wall just pops up, and the parts on top fall down rather than ""blowing up"". You can use the extra parts you get to improve it (by making the bottom section sit closer to the levers that activate it), but even then it's not ideal. The Uruk-hai ladder fits pretty securely onto the outer curved walls, but you'll have to modify it if you want to use it on the straight wall sections. I also wish there was a mechanism to bar the door, like there is in 9473 The Mines of Moria. Still, there's lots of nice playable details, like the opening slots on the wooden section over the gate, and the tower with the horn of Helm Hammerhand for Gimli to blow.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a fantastic set. The MSRP of $129.99 is great, given the number of parts, the quality of the minifigs, and the design of the castle itself. I'd highly recommend getting 9471 to go with this, but as I've said, the set's definitely good enough without it. Unless you've got a particularly strong loathing of LotR or castle sets in general, I'd say this set is a must buy, and may well be the set future castle sets are measured against.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5

"Almaras","2012-06-10T02:00:45.953Z","""What's happening out there? ""Would you like me to describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?""","<font size=""4""><p>This has to be the most impressive Lego set I have built to date. I knew it was going to be big, I even set aside a whole shelf for it, but that wasn’t big enough. Its size is incredible, and the minifigures included are fantastic. </p><p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things that stand out in particular for me. First of all, blowing up the Deeping wall. This works so much better than I was expecting! One of my complaints every time Lego includes an exploding function is that it all ‘explodes’ in one chunk, which isn’t at all realistic, but not here. When the Uruk-Hai Berserker reaches the bomb, five separate chunks of wall will rain down upon him, which is a huge improvement on pretty much every other exploding function I’ve seen! Sure it takes longer to reset, but it is definitely worth it.</p><p>
</p><p>Second thing is the Helm of the Hammerhand, up which Gimli climbs to blow the horn. This tower is really well constructed and doesn’t wobble as some taller structures tend to do, which is always helpful. The ladder goes straight up the inside, but it is in three pieces, so trying to keep it exactly straight can be challenging. The tower has a side door, which I wasn’t expecting, but doors are always welcome in my book. But my favourite inclusion is a box for Gimli to stand on at the foot of the ladder. One of my favourite moments in the Battle of Helms Deep is when Legolas offers to go and find a box for Gimli to stand on, so that he can see over the ramparts, so I thought it was funny for Lego to include a box. </p><p>
</p><p>But, unfortunately, that’s about it. I was disappointed and really missed the little secrets and hidden surprises that I’ve come to expect from Lego. In a set of this size, it thought they’d be everywhere, but there was nothing but a single skull playing peek’a’boo. I knew nothing would top the surprise of having flick-fire missiles on Weathertop, but I was expecting, well, something.</p><p>
</p><p>Being a big set, there are eight minifigs included, but only three are unique to this set. I don’t mind having an extra Gimli, because I’m sure I’ll be wanting all the dwarves I can lay my hands on when The Hobbit sets come out, and you can’t have the Battle of Helms Deep without Aragorn, you just can’t. The more Uruk-Hai the better if you want a massive army, so there is no downfall there. So the minifig collection here is pretty good. The three unique to this set are: the Uruk-Hai Berserker, Haldir and King Theoden. Both Theoden and Haldir have gold printing, which looks really nice! Although Theoden is impressive, it is Haldir who is my favourite for this set. Everything about him cries ‘Elf!’ which is brilliant. His dark red colouring with gold arms and gold detailing looks fantastic, and you can’t go wrong with elf ears! He stands out as one of my favourites, not just for this set, but for the entire range of TLotR sets.</p><p>
</p><p>The Battle of Helms Deep is an incredible set. I think it could have been better, but I cannot deny that it is a great, quality set.</p></font>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

"Sudofranz","2012-07-17T11:43:21.897Z","The wait is over!","<p>This set is a must for Lego LOTR fans who find themselves buying Castle Legos to construct/recreate fantasy scenes. When I first came across images of the Helm's Deep set online I was utterly captivated and in awe of what Lego had created for this theme and instantly purchased it the moment it was released.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>I had ordered this online and it arrived in a massive box, upon opening it, the box for Helm's Deep took up most of the space inside.&nbsp; It is full of numbered bags that coincide with the instructions; as mentioned previously, there are four instruction booklets and each booklet covers a different section of the keep, which is great if you want to build it with someone(Girlfriend and myself split the work).<br><br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Helm's Deep is full of a plethora of parts that can make castle building relatively easy. Most of the keep is assembled with 1 x 4 or 1 x 2 bricks that differ in color to achieve a very weathered look; much like the Helm's Deep in the film, which this set is based off of.&nbsp; My favorite bricks though where the 2 x 2 angled pieces that create a very dynamic look<br>when assembling castles, making the architecture more appealing visually rather than a bunch of right angles. Lego also made assembly a lot easier on the builder by organizing all of the parts in numbered bags that are used to create each part of the keep.&nbsp; If you like sharing the building experience with others, then this orderly method of dividing up bags saves tons of time.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures in my opinion are the best part of the set!&nbsp; There are 8 figures and most are completely unique to the lego world! I'll start with the Uruk-hai; they are probably the&nbsp; most common, they are just your generic filler army, but the added bonus of more cannon fodder is always a wonderful addition to any set.&nbsp; As with most Uruk-hai in the series they come with some armor and swords which you can either equip according to the instructions or gear them up your own personal way.&nbsp; There is one unique Uruk-hai however, the torch runner is included, but unlike the others who get helmets this figure has a helmet painted on his head.&nbsp; I wasn't too bummed out about this, yet it would have been nice just to have another helmet.<br><br>Aragorn and Gimli are also present in this set, which is to be expected, yet Legolas is not.&nbsp; You receive duplicates of these two in the Weathertop set and&nbsp; the Mines of Moria;&nbsp; Legolas sadly is only in one set at the moment and mysteriously missing from Helm's Deep even though he is part of the hero trio in the books and movies.&nbsp; It would have been nice to have had the trio present and an extra Elf is always needed. Aragorn and Gimli are both very detailed; Aragorn comes with one of the new styled swords and some detailed leggings while Gimli has a very detailed helmet and two giant axes.&nbsp; Having more Dwarves is always a bonus! <br><br>Personally one of my main reasons for purchasing this set was Haldir and King Theoden.&nbsp; Haldir has very decorative armor, etched with runes that shimmer when moved in bright light.&nbsp; He also is the only Elf released that isn't wearing green armor and is a very unique addition to anyone's figure collection.&nbsp; Theoden is also in very ornate armor, his breastplate and helm are both covered in designs that make him stand out in a collection of armored knights.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>My Girlfriend and I built this together, it was a repetitive build, but when you are building with someone else it's always fun!&nbsp; It was a brilliant idea to have each section individual of each other and then have them come together in the end to create a massive castle!&nbsp; Since I was working with someone it only took about 2 hours, it probably would have been shorter, but there was a lot of goofing around and talking.&nbsp; Overall it was a very straight forward build that you don't have to think about too much.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Helm's Deep in my opinion is the most unique castle build in Lego's history.&nbsp; Most Lego castles tend to be a square shape with four towers, one on each corner with a draw bridge like feature.&nbsp; This set, even though it was based off of Lord of the rings, is very well done and truly exemplifies how creative Lego can be when it comes to building castles.&nbsp; <br><br>I had also purchased 9471 as well with this set and is really needed to extend the wall.&nbsp; The keep itself is great, but the wall is very short compared to the massive keep.&nbsp; I'm even thinking about purchasing another 9471 to extend the wall again and full up<br>the ranks of my army.&nbsp; The wall even with one extension is bordering being too short, so another wall extension is probably necessary if you want a long wall.&nbsp; Sadly though, there are not enough archers to man the walls, so if you want a fully equip keep you'll need<br>to bring some reinforcements from other sets.<br><br>Strangely enough this set does not come with enough ""good guys;"" most castle sets are filled with hordes of knights that are on the good side of the fight and it is always hard to find enough enemies for them to fight.&nbsp; With 9474 and 9471 you find yourself with a lot of Uruk-hai(which is great) and not enough disposable good guys!&nbsp; I'd love to see more Elves and generic Rohan soldiers! <br><br>Someone mentioned that there where no random things about Helm's Deep, such as hiding skeletons, but if you move the ramp leading up to the front gate there is a skeleton head under there.&nbsp; Just putting that out there for those of us who like random skeletons or ghost haunting your castles.&nbsp; Also mentioned in a previous review is that the gate has no locking mechanism like in the Mines of Moria; this is true and probably one of my least favorite features about the completed model! The Uruk-hai can just walk right up and push the door open!</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all this is one of my favorites, a unique castle that has a lot of fantasy elements and heaps of castle bricks for future projects! Any lego collector would be upset if they let this set go by!&nbsp; Loads of unique weapons and random elements which is probably why this set is a bit more expensive than most.&nbsp; I would have preferred it to be a bit cheaper, but with all the grand elements this incorporates I can see why Lego increased the price a little!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"plantman","2012-09-08T03:05:18.093Z","Don't hesitate with this set.","<p>Nevermind it being a LOTR set, I think this is the greatest castle set Lego has ever produced.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a much more realistic feel to it.&nbsp; Instead of merely consisting&nbsp;of a facade, or a cramped little interior, this set is&nbsp;almost as deep as it is wide, and is open enough to be playable inside and out.&nbsp; The castle conists of 5 modular wall elements that can be connected&nbsp;in any order, and&nbsp;set 9471 can also connect to make an even bigger wall.&nbsp;If money isn't an issue, you could buy two and make a giant castle layout.&nbsp;This set just ends up having an epic feel&nbsp;I think is worthy of Helm's Deep.&nbsp; There is a separate&nbsp;throne room section that sits inside the wall, but isn't connected (there is a ramp on the top that can be layed on the outer wall).&nbsp; One of the wall sections has exploding action to recreate the movie scene, but instead of just a wall section falling over, it literally explodes into 5 seperate sections and gives the action a satisfying feel.&nbsp; It also contains a total of 8 figures, orcs and heroes, to reacreat the battle.&nbsp; Add in 9471 and it feels more like the epic battle scene of the movie.&nbsp; $130 is a lot, but you are getting a lot with this set!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Gandalf_the_brick","2012-11-05T15:59:44.793Z","""Legolas shoot him"" oh wait he isn't included!","<p>Well... This is by far the best Lego castle lego has ever made. It's large and fun and amazing to look at. Read on to find out why I think this set is so great</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>…the box is very attractive supporting a dark mountain where helms deep is set in the movie, the two towers. There is rain heavily pouring to give it the dramatic feel from the movie scene. It shows the minifigures supporting there double sided faces whilst in battle against the four urukhai included. It also promotes the new horses rear leg feature, where it can pivet upwards. The instructions are split into four large books, two for the towers and curving defence walls, one for the inner helm and one for the wall and helm tower. There were no mistakes in the instructions and were very clear. All include a advertisement for other sets and the 4 th book has a large gallery with all the themes figures and a very large part list. In the top right of the box, the one ring is boldly seen with The Lord of the rings logo is seen in the top left. The minifigures included are displayed in the bottom left. All in all very well done.</p>
<h4>Parts&nbsp;</h4><div>...the parts will be a big draw for hardcore fans, what with the 1368 pieces. Averaging at 7.309 p per piece it is very affordable and a good deal, considering there are a lot of large pieces in this set. There are 40 of the new texture (brick) pieces and many other corner and pillar pieces. They come in numbered bags up to nine so not a quick build! All in all this set makes a great parts pack for those that don't need or want the castle.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>…the 8 minifigures included in this set are perfect and 3 of them are currently exclusive to this set. Firstly we get 3 Uruk hai warriors. 2 of these are fully equipped with a chest plate and a brand new shield and sword. They also sport the urukhai helmet piece which covers most of there detailed head, which is double sided, one with the white hand of sauraman, the other looking very angry. The other only wears a helmet and carries a large Lego axe, no chest plate or shield, so you can see the great detailing on the torso. The 4th urukhai is exclusive to the set, the berserker urukhai. He is incredibly detailed, sporting a new face print with back detailing and also a brand new torso print. He carries the famous torch in which he uses to light up the bomb. On his chest he has the white hand printed on. On to the heroes in which we receive four, two of which are exclusive. Firstly we get Aragon and Gimli, two of the three members of the fellowship to fight in the battle. These ate both in one other different set, however they are quite expensive meaning there not at all that common. They both have double sided heads and Gimli is very nice, with his short legs and long beard (almost to long?!?!) they are very nice figures but the question we all want to know, where is legolas. I know he is included in mines of moria but it would of been nice to receive him in this set. However the two exclusives redeem his lost. Fitstly we get halidr, the elf to bring the Elven warriors to helms deep. He is amazingly detailed with gold and burgundy patterns on his torso and legs making him insanely detailed in appearance. He has a cape ( I found the material much more flimsy than usual, my set came with 2) and a very nice double sided head. He sports the same long Elven hair as legolas which is very blonde. Fmyou don't own a legolas figure halidr could be a appropriate replacement. Finally is king theoden. He is very nice with his brown helmet (same mold as workers in urukhai army and the rohan soldier) with amazing gold patterns printed on. He has a nice torso print, but this is covered up by a very nice chest plate which is covered in gold printing. He carries a green and gold shield and a sword. All in all very nice figures but could include a rohan soldier and a legolas.</p>
<h1 class=""productName"" style=""margin: 0px; ""><br></h1><h4>The build</h4><p>…the build took me around 4 hours and was very straight forward with some intresting techniques. It was separated into 9 bags so a very simple build. It was enjoyable and due to separate manuals, it could be a family project so every one could build a different modular to the castle. I built it alone but young children may struggle due to theolder age range of the set ( box says 10-14). You build five different modulars to the castle towers, 2 curving walls, tower and deeming wall and the inner helm (room). A very fun and relaxing build and not to challenging.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>…the completed model looks extraordinary. Lego really have proved themselves worthy of making a great castle with this model. The inner helm has a detailed dining hall where you can sit figures at the table whilst theoden has a well built Brock throne, includes sticker. There is panels all around the walls so figures can stand around. The creeping wall is nice as it includes a very nice exploding wall function where it explodes into five pieces to reveal a gaping hole in the wall. The wall can also connect to urukhai army to increase the size, just slot it into the pins. The tower wins the tallest build with a fantastic ladder leading up to the top where you can see the helm hammer head horn. A Verny nice touch. Lego also included a box for Gimli referring to the famous line in the movie. On the edge of the towers is a door where Aragon and Gimli can escape and jump onto the walkway, using the catapult feature. Again accurate to the movie. It really does look epic and looks great on the shelves. An amazing play item.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>…all in all the best set of the year in my opinion. It really is large, around 50cm wide and is definitely worth the high value. So if your thinking about it don't hesitate, go and buy one. Makes a great holiday gift. Thanks for reading and I hoped I helped you.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Telcontar","2013-01-16T00:45:28.647Z","""Forth Eorlignas!""","<p>Out of all the first LotR sets this one is the best.  It accurately depicts the fortress from the movie plus it has great playability for a fantastic price.  Read on to find out why this is one of the best sets ever made... </p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is like all other LotR boxes with a dramatic, action packed scene on the front.  On the bottom left is a 'box' where pictures of all the different types of minifigs are displayed.  In the top right is a picture of Sauron's finger with The One Ring on it.  The box seemed pretty full to me which is a good thing.  There are four instruction books included.  The first and second books have instructions for the gate and outer walls.  The third book shows how to build the tower and the exploding wall and the fourth book shows how to build the inner keep.   </p><p>One curious thing about the box though is that it cuts off a couple studs at the end of the wall.  On the box it looks a bit shorter than what it really is which is kind of surprising to me.  You would've thought they'd try to show as much set as possible to make it look bigger. </p><p>…</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts in this set are light grey bricks which are always nice to have, especially for castle builders.  There are 40 of the new engraved bricks in this set which is fantastic.  These are used with the pale, light green bricks to add a lot of texture to the walls and to make it look older and more weathered.  There's also a fair amount of dark grey slopes which are nice.  It's hard to see from pictures but there are also a fair number of large castle wall pieces like the ones used in other generic castles.  Unlike those however Helm's Deep is not built around those, instead they are used in effective ways which work well.  (It seems like other castles designed around a few large bricks).  We also get lots of fantastic minifig parts as well as some rare gold and green colored pennants.     </p><p>…</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures in this set are amazing.  Like most of my other reviews, let me start with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Gimli: </strong>I have a detailed review of him in my Mines of Moria review but let be say just this.&nbsp; All the detailing on him is amazing, especially his helmet.&nbsp; I went back and watched part of the movie and checked them side by side and the LEGO pieces are as accurate as can be.</p><p><strong>Aragorn: </strong>I also reviewed him before, this time for Attack on Weathertop.&nbsp; But let me just say this,&nbsp;he is also very accurate and looks&nbsp;suitably like the weather worn ranger that he his with his scruffy face and worn out clothes.  His leg printings are nicely done plus he comes with one of the newer sword molds which is fantastic.</p><p><strong>Haldir: </strong>Since some Lothlorien elves came to the battle in the movie (unlike in the book) Haldir was included and I'm so thankful for it.  His torso has some of the best printing I've seen.  Included are all the intricate and detailed parts and elements of his clothing and armour.  When I first saw him I was almost at a loss for words.  Incredible job LEGO!  His leg printing is fantastic as well which matches up perfectly with the rest of his body.  He also has a very nice back printing but that can't be seen under his two capes.  Yes, 2.  I don't know exactly why he has two but I suppose it makes it a bit thicker and a little less flimsy.  Anyhow, I'm certainly not going to complain about it.  His face is double sided.  One expression has a ""neutral"" look while the other is his fighting expression.  At first I thought his head was the same as Legolas's but after close examination I found that they have slightly different eyebrows and mouths.  Other than that they look identical.  Hmm.  I suppose all elves sort of looked alike.  (At least in Peter Jackson's films).  Haldir's hair is identical to Legolas's though and so is his fantastic longbow.  </p><p><strong>King Theoden: </strong>King Theoden is just as good as Haldir or maybe even better.  His legs are printed with a nice chain mail.  His torso is designed to look like his green tunic with a red undershirt like the one we see in the rest of the film(s).  His head is double sided.  One side is ""happy"" while the other is ""angry/fighting"".  But the really incredible part about him is his armour.  I've never seen such fabulous printing on a LEGO armour piece before in my life!  All the lines and designs in it right down to the two horses on his chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes his helmet.  It's the same mold as Eomer's but the level of detailing is astounding.  All the designs are so accurate to the movie.  He also comes with a sword and a round shield with, again, amazing detail.  Out of all the licensed themes I don't think I've ever seen so much detail and effort put into its [the theme's] minifigs.  Incredible, fantastic job LEGO!</p><p><strong>Uruk</strong>-<strong>hai</strong>:  Again, I reviewed these in the Urak-hai Army set so I'll just make a few notes here:&nbsp; Again, they are incredibly accurate, as well as menacing and tough looking.&nbsp; They all have fantastic new weapons.&nbsp; They both have double-sided heads too.&nbsp; One side is angry while the other is even more angry.&nbsp; On that side there's the white hand of Saruman on them so I guess that would explain for the extra surge of rage and anger.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Berserker Uruk-hai: </strong>These guys were the toughest soldiers in Saruman's army.  Their job was to simply&nbsp;get as many enemies before they were killed.  Consequently these guys got the toughest jobs including this one who lit the bomb to blow up the wall.  His legs are a simple brown with a grey middle section.  His back and torso are nicely printed with two white hands across the chest.  He also has some back printing too.  Instead of giving him a helmet they made his head grey.  I like this decision because the Berserker's helmets were fir tighter than the other Uruk-hai.  Consequently there is no double face but there is back printing on the head.  His mouth is open showing his teeth suggesting that he's yelling as he runs to the bomb.  All in all he's quite intimidating, for a LEGO minifigure.  Especially with that big, black, flaming, torch.  </p><p>…</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is quite fun even though some sections are a mirror image of each other (e.g. the outer walls).  But I had no problem with this.  It's always a challenge building round structures with LEGO but the designers did a fantastic job with this one.  It looks nice, even, and is surprisingly sturdy.  In the walls are periodically placed the engraved and pale green bricks to add more texture to it which looks outstanding.  </p><p>The set is built modularly which makes it nice to build as a family or other small group.  Especially since each instruction book is for a different part.  Even though I get quite a few LEGO sets <em>and</em> even though it is mostly walls I haven't had so much fun building a set in ages.  </p><p>…</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks fantastic.  Even though it is downsized it captures all the awe and ""epicness"" from the movie.  From the causeway up to the gate to the tower, it look incredible.  It looks wonderful as a display but it has tons of playability with it too.  I don't exactly know what the skeleton head inside the ramp is for though...  Inside Theoden's throne room are some nice additional weapons plus some golden cups and plate.  There's also a nice banner on the wall too.  The exploding wall is also one of the best parts.  It's one of the most original ""play features"" I've seen.  Instead of exploding into one of two pieces this explodes into several (5) which looks a whole lot better (even though it takes a little longer to set up).  Occasionally when I didn't press the lever fast enough the bottom piece wouldn't fly out.  But, when I turn the top part of the lever so that it faces in towards the stream it solves the problem. </p><p>&nbsp;LEGO also added in a touch of humour by adding a box at the bottom of the ladder that leads to the horn.  (If you don't understand what I mean you'll have to watch the movie).  The only problem with that is that they didn't include Legolas which puzzled a lot of fans including myself since Legolas was a key part of the battle.  Oh well, I guess they just wanted to make you buy the Mines of Moria (which I would've done anyway even if he was included).  One more great thing about this set is its price.  Most licensed sets are overpriced but this one isn't.  9.5 cents per piece is a good deal, especially with all the great elements and features.  Thank-you LEGO!  All in all this is one of my favorite sets that I own. </p><p>…</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>This very well could be the best set of the theme and maybe even one of the best sets of 2012 (maybe Bag End would take that spot, I don't know).  Whatever the case, this is one of my favorite sets I recommend getting it before it's discontinued.  Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Illixos","2013-01-14T04:22:05.507Z","One of the best of 2012","<p>The Battle of Helms Deep recreates those scenes in the movie where Edoras' inhabitants are at Helms Deep to defend from a Uruk-hai attack orchestrated by Saruman. Is this worth $200 AU, or should it stay on the shelf? Read on to find out!</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is shiny. That was my first thought. It has the Lego logo where it should be, and the LotR logo next to it. On the other side of the top banner, there is a close-up of Sauron's finger, and the One Ring. Underneath, there is a very nice photo of the set and all the minifigures in battle. Usual stuff, age rating, piece count, etc. are just underneath the logo. The back shows the usual, play functions, the other side of Helms Deep, more close ups.</p><p>Upon opening the box, 9 (!) bags full of 1,368 small, plastic bricks fall out, along with 4 (!!) instruction booklets and 6 stickers. Not much to say here, really.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many parts are really notable, and if they are I'll mention them in the next two sections. Mainly the next section.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>All of the minifigures are amazing, and really deserve to be in this set. They are separated over bags 1,3,5 and 7, which is a shame.</p><p>First, there's the three&nbsp;<b>Uruk-hai</b>, who only differ from their weapons and armour. They all have a double-sided head, one angry, and one angry with the White Hand on it. Each has a wonderful helmet (hardly giving their faces any difference), with two having Orc Shields, two having Uruk Swords (one with shield), and the sword-wiedlers having chestplates. The other shielded Uruk has some dirty great axe thing, which is just way too big. The Uruk are just amazing.</p><p><b>Aragorn </b>also appears in Weathertop, but I got him here with a misprinted shirt, but I think this one looks better and more accurate. He also has two faces, neutral and sneering. His hair is the same as Dastan's (colour and all, I'm sure) and his shirt, going off my Weatertop Aragorn is supposed to be a blue shirt with a brown coat thing, which continues onto his legs, and they're the same colour as his boots in the movie. He has a new sword, which I expect to become the standard sword for all themes. Aragorn is a little bit plain compared to other figs in this set, though.</p><p><b>King Théoden </b>is one of three exclusives, and he deserves to be in this set more than any other. I think the helmet might be a new mould, but it is definitely a new and great print, which is good. The chestplate is also well-printed and underneath is a nice shirt piece that, unfortunately, doesn't run with his shirt. His face can be either smiling or sneering, even though he smiles the least in the movies. He wields a sword and a Rohan shield, which is in Uruk-hai Army and is the same mould as Captain America's Shield. Théoden is probably the best figure in the set.</p><p>The <b>Beserker </b>is another exclusive and is the last Orc in the set. His head should be brown, but it's gunmetal instead, which is actually his mask. Oh well, at least his chest is nice and brown, and it has the White Hand print on it. His legs have no print, and he holds a torch to set the bomb off. More on that later...</p><p><b>Haldir </b>is the final exclusive, and probably the most disappointing. He looks a LOT like Legolas, and that can get very confusing. He even has the same hair as him, and expressions, with subtle differences in the face. He wears a reddish cape and a mixture of red and gold, and holds the same bow as Legolas. He could be used as Legolas, but Legolas never wore gold. Overall, he felt like the worst figure in the set, but none were too bad.</p><p><b>Gimli</b>&nbsp;also appears in Moria, and no misprints with this one. He uses short brown minifig legs, and has a nicely printed shirt that is covered by his fantastic beard mould. Seriously, I don't think any beard, even from the Hobbit sets, beats this one. His two faces are unimportant because the beard an the helmet cover them. Speaking of the helmet, it is just fantastic, printing and all. Even though you can get him in Moria cheaper, this set just wouldn't be complete without him.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Very long. If you're going to do this in one go, like I did, prepare for the long parts in bag 6. Unless you have the rest of it clicked together perfectly, they will be a bit frustrating. Otherwise, it's both simple and fun.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Oh man, this is one big set. Longer than the Star Destroyer of 09, this is full of stuff, from exploding walls to 'Toss me.'</p><p>The main gate is where the Uruk-hai try to get in, with nice brick-built doors and catapults that I never use. On top, you can easily find a spot for Haldir and possibly Legolas, if you have him. It is surrounded by two walls and the keep, which I will explain later. The walls are perfect for the ladder to cling on to and the Orcs to climb. There is a play function where you can put Gimli on a catapult-like thing and toss him. It ends up overshooting most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>The horn tower can easily fit a minifig on it's ladder and they can blow the horn. No sound brick, but you can think something up.&nbsp;</p><p>The exploding wall really explodes! (Plastic bomb included) Using a simple Technic mechanism, and flat tiles, the wall can be forced to tip over. (Does not explode 10 feet in the air. Always read the label.)</p><p>The keep is where your heroes can go and rest after a hard day battling. There really isn't much in here, but there is a chicken leg and a mouse. Something could be made up about a cheeky mouse stealing chicken legs...</p><p>But that's not all! You can even connect set 9471 to make an extended wall. That gives you Eomer and a Rohan soldier as well as 4 more Uruk-hai to make your armies bigger.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is probably one of the best sets of 2012, and would be a definite purchase if I wasn't for the horrendous price in Australia. Overall, this is definitely a great set. I would recommend it any day.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,2

<p>The set comes in a standard box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some great parts, including a few mossy green, gray brick pieces along with rails to make the ladder. They also included an elephant trunk that is used as a horn for Gimli to blow.&nbsp; Also, the set comes with little slanted blocks that go great with the castle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with&nbsp;3 exclusive minifigures, including the KING THEODEN!!!! This guy has amazing detail on his shield, torso, and helmet. Haldir also comes in this set, and he has an Elven bow along with great torso and pant printing, and an exclusive face. The berserker Uruk-Hai, who has a metal plate on the back of his head, and has a torch. Also, King Theoden has his horse. The one thing I could&#39;ve asked for would be maybe one more Orc? Or some Rohan guards? Lego makes you buy the Uruk Hai army to get them!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build takes a while, considering there is so much detail! They have&nbsp; an amazing new door that you have to build along with water in the drainage part. and arrow slits for archers to shoot out of!</p>

"Fauch","2015-06-27T22:16:25.97Z","Great castle","<p>Parts</p>

<p>The part selection is rather boring for a 1300+ pieces set, since it&#39;s mostly grey bricks, though it includes mason bricks, many panels in different sizes and lots of hinges. Otherwise, very little to note, a golden plate, a chicken leg... also weapons are very nice, way better than in the castle theme. Overall, very good source of grey bricks and that&#39;s all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigs could be the best as well as the most lacking part of the set. They are excellent, though 3 of them are clones. 3 are exclusive. I would say the berserker is the weakest one due to no leg printing. they all have back printing. they all have double sided face. 1 printed armor. 2 printed helmets. I would say it&#39;s my best set for minifigures, except maybe for pirate ship ambush. Now, what is lacking? Well, too little of them of course. At least getting more orcs or uruk-hais isn&#39;t too hard, but there are only 4 defenders for the whole castle. There should have been some generic elves or humans soldiers, especially when those are so rare...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a rather easy and repetitive build. advanced technics include building at various angles and SNOT, which is hardly more challenging. I would say the rear section was the most interesting to build.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, not a ton for a set of this price. you have the mandatory 2 opposing armies, 4 ways to enter the castle (main gate, hidden gate, ladder, and blowing up a wall), there is not a lot of interactions, except for blowing up a wall (more like collapsing actually) and some catapults.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice. I knew it wouldn&#39;t be very tall, but it is large, it must be close to 50 x 40cm. I think the tower is 25cm. It is larger than the picture shows, but the rear section isn&#39;t that high, it&#39;s lower than the main gate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like how the layout is very 3 dimensionnal and has several layers, instead of just being a flat fascade like many lego buildings. Now the castle is noticeably low, and uruk-hai could climb the wall very easily which is innacurate to movie, but it is consistent with the way lego castles are built, they always have irrealistically small dimensions. One possible improvement could have been to make the moutain under the main gate higher.</p>

<p>Yeah so, lots of 3/5 ratings and the final mark is 5. Makes sense, right? As a display model I think it does well, I like it better than I thought (and the minifigs should be a 5 too). Now for playing, I would rate this lower. Of course it looks fun, it&#39;s a castle, and it&#39;s Helm&#39;s Deep, but there are many cheaper sets which offer many more play features.</p>

"KongZilla","2017-09-01T02:06:46.83Z","Helms Deep Review","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let me start this off by saying, I <em>loved</em>&nbsp;the Lord of the Rings movies, and when I heard Lego was releasing a theme based on this I had to get them. My collection started with the Orc Forge and quickly grew to include many other sets as well. The one that stood at to me above all else was by far the Helms Deep set. There are so many different possibilities with this set, all of the minifigures you could want to play out epic scenes from the movies.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was especially happy at the berserker orc and loved the detail on the head. The Uruk-Hai army is nice as the armor differentiates from one main set and so allows you to have what looks close enough to be an army but yet doesn&#39;t look absolutely identical. Gimli and Aragorn are in many of the other sets but still give multiple options for playing or dynamic set-ups. Haldir&nbsp;looks great and you can almost picture him shouting orders to his men. Theodin&nbsp;looks great alone, but when you put on his chest plate and helmet he really looks like a great king of Middle Earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though the age range is from 10 - 14 I suggest any adult to purchase this and as long as a child can build it, he/she would have so much fun playing with it. Though the build can be tough I would say it&#39;s a moderate model as most they break&nbsp;it down into easy to handle parts and then snap them together with pins. This also allows it to easily be taken apart and transported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is absolutely huge as it sprawls over a 22 inches&nbsp;wide and the tower is just under 15&nbsp;inches tall. Playability has no limits as this model has everything from an exploding castle wall to the working&nbsp;catapults placed strategically along the wall. I also love how you can buy the Rohan set and connect it with this one to create an even larger scene. You could even buy 10 of them and have an even larger castle. While this may not sound like a good way to spend your money (and trust me it isn&#39;t) it would definitely improve the scene and playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All in all I would definitely give this model 5 stars!</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-11-18T04:54:01.047Z","An absolute must for any castle or LOTR fan","<p>As a kid my favorite Lego set growing up was the King&#39;s Castle set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6080-1/King-s-Castle"">6080</a>). However it is still the only Lego castle that I own.&nbsp;My only other set from the castle theme of the 80&#39;s was the Armor Shop (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6041-1/Armor-Shop"">6041</a>), and I&#39;ve never gotten anything castle related since. So I was pretty excited to get this set, and while it&#39;s very different from my childhood set, it is a fantastic set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The minifigures to this set are incredible. In fact, it is because I had received this sets collection of minifigures from a friend who was moving that I got into the whole LOTR/Hobbit line. With 8 minifigures in this set equally divided between good and bad you sure have a lot to play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 4 orcs. 3 of them are identical with the only exception that one of the three doesn&#39;t wear armor, and they all look great. The unique orc is the berserker orc who lights the fuse to the bomb. He is actually completely unique to any of the orcs in the entire line, so he is definitely a minifigure you will want to get your hands on. While his legs aren&#39;t detailed, and he has no hair or helmet, he still looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you get the good guys. Two of whom are Aragon and Gimli&nbsp;(surprisingly Legolas is missing). These two are very common appearing in several other sets each, but still very nice to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the elves, we get Haldir. Personally I don&#39;t think he looks all that unique and is certainly interchangeable with some of the elves from the Hobbit line. However this isn&#39;t a bad thing since those elves could then easily be brought into this set to join him, and we really don&#39;t need another Legolas minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally we get King Theodin&nbsp;who is without a doubt the highlight of this set and maybe even the entire line. The printing on his torso and legs is the clothing he wears and while very accurate are nowhere near as exciting as the attire of some of the elves. However what sets him is his armor. His body armor is the same mold that two of the orcs from this set wear, however Theodin&#39;s armor is printed magnificently. His helmet is also amazing, I&#39;m not sure if it is the same mold as Gimli&#39;s helmet, but even if it is the printing looks great. But how do you make a great minifigure even better? Give him one of the new horses with the poseable legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set contains an absolutely amazing collection of parts for anyone wanting to build a castle, including 10 window panels and 4 corner walls. Now these parts have changed a lot since the 80&#39;s, but if anything they are probably easier to use as they are now square. Besides them you of course have mostly light gray, but unlike the monotone Tower of Orthanc, you also have a healthy collection of dark grays, blacks, browns, sand greens, and a few other colors. Not to mention you get lots of large parts and tons of hinges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent 4 hours building this set, but much of that time was spent sorting and looking for bricks as I got the set used and the bricks were all mixed together in a large container. Because there are so many different sections to the build, it is constantly changing and introducing different techniques which keeps it pretty exciting. Even the symmetrical builds require you to pay attention as sand green bricks get scattered randomly throughout the builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The curved walls are reminiscent to the Attack on Weathertop set in that you alternate stacking hinges and bricks, only in this set each curved panel is much larger. I was more impressed with Weathertop as it packed this technique into a much smaller space, but it is definitely nice to see this technique used on a much larger scale as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The breakaway wall is interesting as at first it seems very simple, but then as you continue building you see that you are stacking breakaway section after section to create a rather complex and compelling explosion when you activate what is this sets one and only play feature (aside from a couple of tiny catapults). Unfortunately the effect doesn&#39;t work great as the wall chunks don&#39;t go flying, but they do definitely fall apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The build is also completely modular, allowing you to connect any section to any other section on either side. Including the large section containing the throne room which wouldn&#39;t normally be attached. This is of course how you attach 9471 if you have the add on set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;What&#39;s amazing about this set is how much it is able to achieve with just simple stacking. There is very little technic or SNOT in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I absolutely love this set. It definitely is a castle, and the throne room is incredibly well detailed (even though it relies on stickers). Unlike my childhood set however, it is not a complete castle as it does not enclose itself but is rather just a facade with one interior room. But because it all comes apart and can be repositioned, you could certainly lay it out to create an enclosed space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, I highly recommend this set to any castle or LOTR&nbsp;fans. It truly looks amazing and is impressively large as well. Combine that with a fantastic collection of minifigures, a constantly changing build, and the ability to be rearranged to create any look you like, and you have one of the best Lego sets ever made.&nbsp;</p>

"gorf43","2021-10-26T04:49:20.403Z","The Battle Of Helms Deep","<p>As a big fan of LOTR, it was only a matter of time until I put my Lego money to this set, and was it ever worth it, even&nbsp;nine years later! Obviously, I can&#39;t recommend the current price for a sealed version of this set, but given that it was nine years old, sealed, and above all is just a great set, the price I paid was fair. On to the set:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I admit, I&#39;m not a castle fan, buying this set only because its from LOTR, but if there was a set that could get me into castles, it would be this one. The overall shape whilst being small, is sufficiently accurate to the film. I am happy with the height of the walls and they all have about the same proportions. The pieces used to make the windows slightly smaller is quite clever although they take up some space inside. The small wooden doors above the gate actually work, and you can drop small items on the Orcs from above. (All I want is a PJ minifig to go with that particular feature.) The interior of the main castle is quite empty, which isn&#39;t a big deal for me, but for kids at the time, it would probably have been disappointing. The detail is saved for the inner wall which is simply placed inside the outer wall. One problem it has is that it&#39;s not tall enough compared to the outer wall. I raised mine two bricks high and it looks a lot better on display. Its interior has been influenced by the keep, which is actually inside the mountain. It is inaccurate, but the details are welcome! It has King Theodens campaign throne, some weapons, and a table and chairs. I also like the large stickered banner with a white horse on a green background. The tower Hornburg is noticeably shorter than the real one and the top is kind of a mess of bricks. Still, it has the horn, and a long ladder to climb to the top. I also mustn&#39;t forget the Gimli (and Aragorn) tossing function. It has been the most played with feature on my set, its quite fun to toss Gimli and send the Orcs toppling! Also included is the small door for them to sneak out of, a detail which actually surprised me was included. Next is the Deeping Wall. The wall is obviously too small, but as purchasing #9471 Uruk Hai Army at the same time is basically a given, it quickly becomes a suitable length. Something I don&#39;t find fault with, the set is designed to be expanded on. One surprising thing I noticed was the complete failure of the exploding function! It actually did not work! The lever directly connected to the technic axle has two pieces on the end. Push it down, and the adjoining piece hits the table and the wall maybe tips a little. Easily fixed by removing those two pieces, but I&#39;m quite surprised that they designed it that way. Once fixed however, it works seamlessly! (I still think that if the Gondorians had just built the culvert grate flush with the outside of the wall, Sarumans bomb would have failed miserably lol) The set also has a nice amount of torches which really brighten up the boring grey and green. Well, thats probably enough on the build itself, but it is quite solid, and whilst being too small overall, is very accurate looking. Minifigs next:</p>

<p>This set comes with eight minifigs, four for each &quot;side&quot; offering nice battle action. The set on its own looks quite sparse, but once again, when added to its counterpart, it gets another four Uruk Hai, Eomer, a Rohan soldier, and another horse. Add Legolas, and you&#39;ve got a very fine fifteen minifigs. On a humorous note, I always thought the elf in the set was Legolas. Fast-forward to me actually getting the set and realising that I did not in fact have Legolas and would have to spend more money on Lego. Haldir was a very welcome addition though, and thirty dollars for a Legolas really isn&#39;t bad. King Theoden, Aragorn, Gimli, and Haldir are all included. Gimli has a nice helmet, but in order for him to request a box, you have to remove his legs. Aragorn and Haldir aren&#39;t anything amazing minifig wise, but are excellent to have.&nbsp;King Theoden is where you start admiring the amazing printing. He is an exclusive minifig, and a handsome one as well. He has a standard Rohan helmet, but it has beautiful golden horse printing on it. He also has a cleanly printed shield and exclusive printed armour. The included Uruk Hai are the same as #9471, but are detailed well. There is also the exclusive Uruk which lights the fuse of Sarumans bomb. He is a somewhat basic looking minifig, but offers some nice variation to the Uruk army. These minifigs on their own aren&#39;t quite enough for the castle, but add a few more and you&#39;ve got an army!</p>

<p>This set just makes me wish all the more that I had got these sets when they were available An impressive set then, and now! I can&#39;t speak for everyone on the price, but if you want one, buy it now before these go up in value with the new Amazon show coming out soon! Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>
