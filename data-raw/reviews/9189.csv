It also is a unique vehicle compared to some of the other&#39;s we&#39;ve gotten from past Themes. I think it&#39;s a pretty worthwhile set to pick up or track down and here&#39;s why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all LEGO Friends sets I find the box design for this set really fun and stand out. It shows a lot of fun creativity for the builders who are interested in these sets and features a lot of details in a great display setting for the set you build. Overall a great box that really attracts the eye while on the shelf.</p>

<p>The instructions match the box designs for LEGO Friends in all levels. They share some of the images on the front and involve easy to follow instructions for building the models. My only complaint is that some sets don&#39;t have cardboard protection, which really hurts the manuals due to the sheer amount of empty space found inside the boxes. And since LEGO Friends sets rely a lot on stickers for details I feel that LEGO needs to introduce small sticker protection bits of cardboard to prevent damage or creasing/bending.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of great parts, the Horse Trailer itself uses great pieces in unique colours and the car/jeep used to pull the trailer has some nice dark maroon parts also. The horse and saddle are fun pieces too even if they don&#39;t match other Themes design aesthetics, they work quite good for LEGO friends sets. The sheer number of Mini-Figure accessories is also a great deal for this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like most Friends sets this one only includes a single Mini-Doll, for a set of this size some might find it a bit disappointing however considering the horse included with the set with only one mini-doll to ride it makes sense.</p>

<p>As Mini-Dolls go, since this is an early release set there aren&#39;t many unique pieces for Emma, she&#39;s got the same torso found in other sets and is&nbsp;sporting white riding pants. The only thing unique to her is the hat, this riding hat for the Mini-Dolls works great because unlike the helmets some sets have featured this piece is sculpted with the Mini-Dolls hair in mind. She has a ponytail in back and bangs on the side, so she doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s bald underneath it.</p>

<p>Accessorywise she includes a lot of the same ones found in other animal based sets, there are a lot of ribbons and bows, a bar of soap, a few brushes, combs&nbsp;and a squeeze bottle for water for washing the animal. There&#39;s also an apple and a carrot to feed her horse. Overall it&#39;s a great Mini-Doll to include in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build in this set is very satisfying, it comes in two numbered bags the first of which builds the car/jeep and the Mini-Doll while the second builds the horse trailer itself and a small open air stable or something like that for the horse. It uses stickers for the details and is just all around fun to build. It&#39;s also quite straightforward with out any tricky sections for the build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Emma&#39;s Horse Trailer looks great, the car/jeep from bag one is a really impressive build. It&#39;s thick and chunky looking, making it stand out as a great looking and powerful vehicle, this one could go offroad if necessary.</p>

<p>The trailer is also a solid build and works great, we don&#39;t see many of these types of vehicles in LEGO and when you do find one it&#39;s great to see them look like solid fun to play with builds. Admittedly it does suffer from having too few pieces for the actual trailer build and a load of stickers instead of printed details. Some people might call it a juniorized build, but honestly I don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>The small outside stable thing for the horse is a nice little build as well, featuring three of the sculpted brick pieces and has a fun little lantern build on the side. The yellow crate is a nice piece too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I honestly think this is a really great and unique set, it works great with the Summer Riding Camp and Stables sets and is a solid stand alone set as well. The horse is a bit of a different piece, but it still works in the land of Friends. I do wish Emma had an extra hairpiece so she could drive the car/jeep without wearing her riding hat, but it isn&#39;t a deal&nbsp;breaker.</p>

<p>I really recommend picking this one up if you can still find it, it&#39;s a great overall set and stands out as a rare vehicle build from LEGO.</p>
