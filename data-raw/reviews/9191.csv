Meanwhile Andrea is the one who sings, and performs music, however with the Summer 2012 wave of LEGO Friends Mia got a set of drums in her bedroom and here, we find Andrea hanging out with a little bunny rabbit. (Perhaps her pet.)</p>
<p>Out of the three Summer Wave sets of 2012 in this price range, I have to say this is the least interesting out of the bunch as far as potential fun factor goes. While Mia's Bedroom and Olivia's Speedboat offered up some interesting new builds or fun looking little playsets, this one is slightly less bang for your buck.</p>
<p>There is only one model built in this set, with two small attachments, or side-on set pieces if you will. The main model is a large Bunny House (or Hutch if you prefer) where Andrea's pet (I assume) lives. The model uses an 8x8 base plate in dark green for the primary model, it includes a lot of white, light orange, pink and dark rose pieces to build. There are three of the smaller fence pieces used... Well I always thought of them as balcony railing pieces honestly, to prevent Mini-Figures from falling off their balconies. These pieces are nice, but the two larger white fence pieces new for the Friends Theme (though perhaps introduced with Belville I'm not 100% sure on this.) are much more desireable for parts use.</p>
<p>The Bunny Hutch doesn't have too many features, the roof opens and closes on two c-clips, there's a small water bottle build on the left hand side and a push-broom for Andrea to use. Despite what the box art implies, Andrea looks more natural using the broom with her hand behind her back holding the handle than in front. What can one say about a Bunny Hutch? Honestly? The parts are great, the colors are nice, but the overall appeal of this set isn't really there for this adult.</p>
<p>Two 2x8 smaller light green plates are used to make small ancilliary set pieces, one side in the instructions is used to hold a fence piece and the red bucket, while the other holds the flower and the carrot. (This is how the instructions tell you to build them, the box art shows the reverse, with the flower by itself and the bucket on the same piece as the carrot.) I like the new Carrot piece that LEGO has created, unfortunately it just looks too big to be sticking out of the ground like that, as carrots don't typically grow this way. Fortunately there is an extra stem in this set, so if you'd prefer you could place the carrot stem in the ground/tile and just have Andrea holding the carrot.</p>
<p>Andrea's a lovely looking Mini-Doll, wearing the top found in her previous set Andrea's Stage, and the lower torso from City Park Cafe, she's a wonderful looking Mini-Doll with great details and designs in her print. The light blue skirt compliments the green top with the music notes much better than her white pants did in Andrea's Stage set. The bunny is also a nice animal, some have complained that it doesn't really fit in with regular Mini-Figures, I however say that if you can combine LEGO bricks with DUPLO bricks and build up a whole slew of brick-built animals that look out of place next to LEGO Mini-Figures in the Creator Modular Houses 3-in-1 sets than you won't find a thing wrong with this bunny. Although, she does look strange with that hole in the top of her head for bows and things.</p>
<p>Overall, as far as my thoughts go, this is an ok set in this price range. According to Brickset right now it's on sale at LEGO.com for close to US price in Canada. And while it's uses are limited for Adults it's definitely much better for the target age range of the LEGO Friends line. Young girls will adore the rabbit and it's home, the Mini-Doll and even the building experience here isn't too frustrating or difficult to follow. It includes a spare flower stem as well as the Carrot stem, so there's more on offer here than you might otherwise think. With all the extra petals and things in the Friends line having enough stems to&nbsp;go around is never an issue. Recommended for the target age range, adults might find use for the parts, however as a model for display goes, unless you're really into rabbits or want to expand on the Heartlake Vet set you might want to skip this in favor of the smaller Bunny House from the Series 2 Friends Booster Pack line. (For lack of a better term.)</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4
