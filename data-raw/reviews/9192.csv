<p>Mia's Drum Kit: A fun looking little model with some parts you might not have expected. The build on this is easy to follow, with a bit of cleverness to it that allows you to use the standard LEGO rocket engine found on such Mini-Starships as the TIE Bomber for the bass drum. Then you've got two cymbals on stands and two other drums as part of the kit, all useing such pieces as black telescopes, yellow radar dishes and light tan lightsaber blades for the drum sticks. Mia sits on an orange stool behind the drum kit and can bang on them to practice her music. Once again I am getting some old fashioned Jem and the Holograms similarities, here is Mia who plays the drums, her friend Andrea is a singer and Emma designs fashions perhaps for their band to wear. All that's missing is a keyboardist, a guitarist and a Synergy. (Heh, heh.) The drum kit also includes a neat little music stand with a new clip style piece and a printed music sheet. Welcome parts to anyone who enjoys MOCing.</p>
<p>Mia's Nightstand: Or maybe it's a desk, this model uses some pink and teale pieces, curved bricks and plates, it also includes a book in Dark Rose (Which is a type of Pink, however you don't just say pink when describing the variety of colors in a LEGO Friends set.) This model isn't as impressive as the drum kit, however it does have two impressive elements to it. The small radio and the flower vase are fun little builds that sit on the top, clever use of the clear Mini-Figure head yet again as a flower vase. Naturally there is a spare stem piece in this set. The book just slides into a shallow groove left open in the front of the nightstand/desk, it sticks out perhaps a bit too far, and does seem to be an odd place to store a book, but I know some people like to keep certain books close at hand so who knows. Perhaps it's perfectly natural.</p>
<p>Mia's Bed/Dresser: This model is fun and fun to build, we don't get many call for beds in LEGO sets so when a Mini-Figure recieves a nice place to sleep it is a welcome addition for MOCs or Modular Houses. The bed is mostly smooth plates on top of curved pieces to simulate sheets, and bricks, mostly in the lighter pink with more of that dark rose for the headboard and the foot of the bed/blanket. The pillow is a sloped piece found in many other sets, in standard white coloring. One odd choice in the design is to include an orange 1x2 tile piece, and I say odd because while the designers used it as a place to lock in the basket that comes in the set, when you don't have the basket sitting on the bed it seems like Mia would be rather uncomfortable sleeping on it. (Nothing a good spare 1x2 tile can't fix though.)</p>
<p>Beside the bed, literally right beside it is the dresser, this is an odd placement in only that I know very few people who sleep with their dresser's right up alongside their beds, however the base it is attached to is left with one space on the end unused, in case you want to move the whole thing over one to give it a better look for Mia. There is only one drawer, a small nook with another 1x2 orange tile for placing something, the basket fits in a bit too tightly there to get it in and out for easy access/play, though it will fit there. And a curious looking style of lamp on top, almost like some kind of new-age retro lava lamp thing or something. Very top of the line artsy.</p>
<p>This version of Mia is wearing her light blue shirt with the animal paw prints, previously what I mistook for a partial sun-rise. She's also got on a light pink skirt and some matching darker rose shoes. Mia's a peach, I love her design, the hair color choice for her. It's a nice rich red almost Mary-Jane Watson red (or Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane at any rate.) and I adore her freckles, they are just too cute. And this is coming from a Male AFOL.</p>
<p>Overall this Bedroom set for Mia is a great buy, well worth tracking down before it vanishes completely, as the 2012 Friends sets might not be so easy to find now that we're in 2013. You get a slew of great looking models, great pieces, the CMF Series 7 Grandma Visitor Basket, a transparent Mini-Fig head and something else for Mia to do when she's not taking care of animals. (Rocking out as it where.) Strongly Recommended, in 2013 Andrea is the next Mini-Doll to recieve a Bedroom set, let's hope that the designers wow us again and don't simply repeat the same basic model elements from this set. We'll have to wait for the Summer wave to find out.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>This set has many rare pieces such as the basket, mail card, drums, book, music notes, drawer, and flowers. Book fits into the bottom of the desk. Very nice to play with.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The shirt on Mia rubs off. I guess that&#39;s the only con!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set. I rate it 4 stars.</p>
