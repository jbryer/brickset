"Rolyat24","2012-06-05T10:59:14.99Z","Great For A Spinner Set","<p><b>9569 Spitta</b> is a $9.99 Ninjago spinner set with 20 pieces. &nbsp;It's a nice set for a spinner, but doesn't offer too much playability on its own. &nbsp;I purchased this at Target for the full price, however I may suggest you wait for it to be reduced. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box (if you can call it that) is the same as all of the other spinners. &nbsp;Known as ""blister pack"" it's plastic covering the pieces, with a backing of cardboard. &nbsp;On the back it shows other sets you can buy and Spitta in action. &nbsp;Great if you're planning on leaving it packaged, but not if you want to open it and resell it used. &nbsp;Once opened, the pack is ruined.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are, as usual, two sheets of &nbsp;paper folded neatly into rectangles. &nbsp;One shows ads for upcoming sets and the pieces included in <b>9569 Spitta. &nbsp;</b>The other sheet explains the game of spinjitzu and how to use the cards. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The main parts of <b>9569 Spitta</b> are the spinner, weapons, cards, and minifig. The spinner is transparent lime green on top, making it one of the brightest spinners out there. &nbsp;It is printed with green designs. &nbsp;The bottom is gray with a lime circular piece. &nbsp;It does have the holes for putting blades on the bottom that the 2011 spinners were lacking. &nbsp;The crown is a new piece for 2012 which is placed on top of the spinner. &nbsp;Spitta's crown is transparent purple, contrasting with the green spinner. &nbsp;It is made to look like two snakes circling Spitta: one purple and black, the other green. Altogether, this is one of the best spinners yet.</p><p>As with all spinners, <b>9569 Spitta</b> comes with three weapons. &nbsp;The first, a scimitar, is now quite common in the Ninjago theme. &nbsp;The clip at the bottom is neat in that you can attach a bar piece. &nbsp;The next weapon is a transparent purple viper that is held in the hand like a whip. &nbsp;This is probably my favorite weapon and one of the reasons I purchased this in the first place. &nbsp;It is really nice and detailed. &nbsp;Spitta's golden weapon is a venom pickaxe made up of four pieces: a gold wand piece, a gold modified&nbsp;light-saber hilt, a small white tooth, and a transparent green dome piece. &nbsp;It works great with the spinner and was well thought out.</p><p>Although I don't use the cards, it is worth mentioning that this comes with <i>Spitta, Electric Maelstrom, Use Surroundings, Panic Stations</i>, and <i>Assist.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The minifig is the main part of any spinner set and is what makes it or breaks it. &nbsp;I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Spitta. &nbsp;The front is lime green with scale patterns and red (Not water balloons: see my review for <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=42573"">9562&nbsp;</a><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=42573"">Lasha</a>)</span>&nbsp;venom capsules. This pattern is continued on the back. Spitta's arms are dark green with black hands. &nbsp;The dark green head is the best part. &nbsp;It is a new mold used only for the Mezmo minifigure and this. &nbsp;A hood comes down over the head and ends in two big white teeth. &nbsp;Spitta has four yellow eyes, a great detail added by Lego. &nbsp;The top of the hood is printed with a lime green and black scale pattern. &nbsp;Altogether, Spitta is a wonderful minifigure and<b> 9569 Spitta</b> is the cheapest way to get him.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>There isn't much of a build at all. &nbsp;It takes, at most, 2 minutes to complete. &nbsp;You add the crown and rounded plate to the spinner, build the pickaxe, and then the minifig. &nbsp;The build is balanced, however, by the playability.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model has a lot of playability, but only if you have another spinner and another person. &nbsp;Although spinjitzu doesn't appeal to adults, children seem to enjoy it greatly. &nbsp;Spitta does excellent on his spinner and the weapons work well with it. &nbsp;The cards add to it and help make the game more exciting. &nbsp;So although it's not great for display, it's fun to play with.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This concludes my review of <b>9569 Spitta</b>. &nbsp;Overall, it's a great set to add to a spinjitzu collection and is also good for the minifig. &nbsp;At $9.99, it's a little expensive, but if you're a Ninjago fan it's definitely worth it. &nbsp;Buy it? &nbsp;If you're (like me) into snake minifigures, don't hesitate. &nbsp;If you like parts, don't buy it. &nbsp;It only has 20 pieces. &nbsp;If you enjoy playing with your models and have other spinners, this is the set for you. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Topcop999","2012-09-21T14:30:27.82Z","Great value and parts especially to KFOL's.","<p>I thought I would review this set as it was a very&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;good set in my opinion.
</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very nice unique Snake minifig.</li><li>Nice variety of weapons. (The Viper is very cool)</li><li>Vibrant trans coloured spinner &amp; crown.</li><li>Cards - a nice extra.</li><li>Great playability to younger fans.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The price is a bit&nbsp;expensive but not a lot.</li><li>Blister packaging - in my opinion this is&nbsp;inconvenient&nbsp;because&nbsp;they are annoying to open and in my case dropped out the spinner.</li></ul>
<p>I would not&nbsp;usually&nbsp;buy Ninjago sets as they don't really interest me but these new Spinners such as the NRG Ninjas, this one and Slithra are very, very detailed minifigs with great designs and colours on the spinners making me want to pick this one and NRG Zane up.</p><p><br></p><p>I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set to anyone who likes Ninjago, the minifigs or wants something unique.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,4
"Super_Mario_64","2013-02-18T14:19:34.663Z","Ninja(Snake)- Go!","<p>This is the 4th-best 2012 spinner set(see my BrickList)<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box(if you can call it that) is pretty well designed. On the front, an overdone design of Skalidor and Chokun is shown along with a picture of what pieces the set comes with. On the back there is a turnstile showing the weapons, minifig, crown, and spinner that the set comes with. In the first fold-out instruction booklet it's pretty much all advertising. In the second, the instructions explain how to play the game of Spinjitzu.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The pieces the set comes with are pretty nice: the spinner is transparent neon green with unusual dark green&nbsp; and red markings. The crown is a transparent purple&nbsp;snake head crown with black and green markings. The set comes with two navy blue 1x2 bricks and a 2x2 flat brick, all three for holding the character card. The three weapons are the venom pickaxe, the scythe blade, and the snake minion. The pickaxe is a very nice weapon and comes with an extra white tooth. the scythe blade is a nice blade that works well. the snake is transparent purple just like the crown.&nbsp;It also comes with the lime green spinner base.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set comes with one minifig: Spitta. Spitta's head comes in it's own bag of softer plastic. The head design is the same as Mezmo's. Spitta has two enormous teeth, four yellow eyes and black and green markings. The torso has  snake scale printing along with two vials of venom that leaks out of his mouth. The legs just continue the scale pattern.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's a spinner set. What did you expect?</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The spinner spins very well and looks cool while it's spinning.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Spitta is a very good value for ten dollars and I would reccomend this set to any Ninjago fan.</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
