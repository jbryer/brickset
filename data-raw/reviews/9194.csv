"Big_Green","2012-06-08T09:02:47.14Z","Neat little set.","<p>I found this set&nbsp;at my local Tesco, along with NRG Cole and some of the older spinners. I wasn't really interested in him at first glance, but as I started to inspect the him, I soon realised that it would be a shame to give him a miss. Here's why...</p>
<p>NRG JAY</p>
<p>What an awesome little chap he is.&nbsp;His ninja head gear is the new mould, allowing it to turn a little more than the old ones. It's painted&nbsp;in blue with a small&nbsp;chrome finished lightening decal&nbsp;on the forehead. His face&nbsp;is blue, and has the same colours as the rest of his body: Blue with chrome yellow and blue. The markings are the same as the normal Jay figure, painted in the blue and yellow colours. His body has a big blue lightening fork running down the right side, with Jays' ninja logo on. His body is also double sided, the other side is basicly the same, only a bit bigger and without the ninja logo.</p>
<p>THE SPINNER, CROWN AND WEAPONS.</p>
<p>The spinner is nearly as cool as Jay himself! It is again the blue and yellow colour, only on the spinner it's translusent, like the old Sensei Wu and Garmadons' spinners.&nbsp;It has four little forks of lightening in&nbsp;each corner aswell, which is a nice touch.&nbsp;His spinner is cool aswell, as it has new raggedy blades on each side, plus nice colours. The weapons that he comes with are a ninja sword, a chrome spear and a big gold spear. The sword and chrome spear are just avarage ninja weapons, but the gold spear is deafinetly the best, as it comes with a new golden lightsaber handle.</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>I would highly reccomend this set, as it has a great little figure, cool colours and best of all, the parts are NOT made in china, unlike the old spinners! The weapons could do with a bit of work though!</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,3
"Ernst","2012-07-01T18:01:54.97Z","NRG Jay, great stuff for the Ninjago fan.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : This review is both as a parent and as AFOL. A nice set with a nice minifigure Jay NRG with in stead of the yellow face a blue face. Comes with a spinner, several weapons, some bricks and the cards. Considering my kids enthousiasm a nice set so 4 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No building so 1 brick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : Besides the great minifigure, 2 spears (black and gold) and&nbsp;a sword there's also a Silver blade you can mount on the great looking spinner and 2 trans blue bricks and 5 cards. The spinner is trans blue like the bricks with great drawings on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : I'm not a Ninjago player (I'm a builder)&nbsp;but I can imagine the fun this gives to kids. I tried the spinner and it works great I must say, in the future I will go and see how to play with these fun sets and how to use the cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : Price was â‚¬9,95 and you get a great minifigure, spinner etc. so worth the money in my opinion.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
