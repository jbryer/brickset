<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Not much to say here. &nbsp;The package is the same ""blister pack"" used for all spinners. &nbsp;With ads on the back and the contents on both sides. &nbsp;Although I'm getting tired of these packages, I've become better at opening them without completely ruining them. &nbsp;I've said before that the packaging isn't great if you fancy selling it used, and I still agree. &nbsp;However, if carefully opened, the blister pack can be saved.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are (surprise, surprise) two pages folded neatly into rectangles. &nbsp;On one is a bunch of ads for newer Ninjago sets, and on the other are the instructions for how to play spinjitzu. &nbsp;Very detailed, as always.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The weapons included in&nbsp;<b>9571 Fangdam </b>are a mace, a viper, and a toothed staff. &nbsp;The mace is silver and nothing we haven't seen before. &nbsp;Due to it's short length and flimsy structure, it does not work as well as some weapons with the spinner. &nbsp;The viper as a weapon is kind of odd. &nbsp;I do like the inclusion of it, as it adds more playability, but as a weapon? &nbsp;Anyway, it's white, held in the hand like a whip, and works quite nicely with the spinner. &nbsp;Last but not least is Fangdam's golden weapon, a toothed staff (or so I'll call it). &nbsp;It consists of a staff, modified&nbsp;light-saber hilt, and two small fang pieces all in pearl gold. &nbsp;It's long enough to work the best with the spinner, but not too long to unbalance the whole model.</p><p>The best part of this model has to be the spinner. &nbsp;It has a dark gray bottom with a transparent red top, printed with white spikes. &nbsp;The crown is also transparent red and is made to look like two snakes curling around one another: one red and one white, both with black markings. &nbsp;It's the color scheme that makes it the best spinner of the year. Most of the snake spinners in 2012 have been opposing colors (Ex: <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9591-1"">Chokun's spinner</a> green and orange) &nbsp;but Lego really did a great job designing this. &nbsp;The colors red, white, and black match the minifigure perfectly. &nbsp;It also makes it look excellent while spinning. &nbsp;The markings work really well with Fangdam too.</p><p>Although I have no interest, it should be noted that the cards included are <i>Fire Fields</i>, <i>Crushing Bolt</i>, <i>Unsteady</i>, and <i>Crown of Fire</i>. &nbsp;Fangdam's character card had SP 500 for Fire, 300 for Lightning, 200 for Earth, and 100 for Ice.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>Although the spinner is the best of the year, the minifig is relatively boring. &nbsp;Fangdam has appeared in two other sets as of 2012 (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9445-1"">9445</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9457-1"">9457</a>, plus gear <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/853404_LEGO_Ninjago_Magnet_Set:_Sensei_Wu,_Fangpyre_and_Ninja_Jay"">853404</a>). &nbsp;This is the cheapest way to get him though. &nbsp;Fangdam has white arms and hands with the rest of the body being red. &nbsp;There is a white/black scale pattern on both sides of the torso, with the front extending onto the legs. &nbsp;Great detail. &nbsp;Perhaps the most disturbing part of this set is Fangdam's head, or heads. &nbsp;Yes, Fangdam has two heads, using a new mold used only for him and Fangtom. &nbsp;Despite being slightly creepy, the head is actually well designed. Both heads are detailed with eyes that rise out of the head. &nbsp;The back is printed with black scales, and extends partially over the back of the torso. &nbsp;So, although it may not be a very rare figure, it is definitely quite interesting. For more information on Fangdam and other figures, see <a href=""http://ninjago.lego.com/en-us/world/characters/default.aspx"">here</a>.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build, if it can be considered a build, takes about 1-3 minutes. &nbsp;There are no hard or unclear steps. &nbsp;An extra gold tooth is present.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The completed model has a lot of playability, but only if you have another spinner and another person. Although spinjitzu doesn't appeal to adults, children seem to enjoy it greatly. Fangdam does fine on his spinner and the staff works well with it. The cards add to the model and help make the game more exciting. So although it's not great for display, it's fun to play with.</span>
</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This concludes my review of&nbsp;<b>9571 Fangdam. &nbsp;</b>Overall, it's a great set and probably the best spinner of 2012. &nbsp;As with all spinners, $9.99 is pricey, and waiting for a sale on Amazon might be a better option. &nbsp;Buy this set? &nbsp;If you are only looking for parts, then don't bother. &nbsp;There are only 20 pieces and this isn't the best way to get most of them. &nbsp;If you collect minifigures, this is the best way to get Fangdam and he is really a nice figure. &nbsp;If you are a big fan of spinjitzu, then definitely buy it. &nbsp;It includes some cool weapons, a great figure, and the best spinner of the year. &nbsp;This is definitely the set for you.</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-01T20:53:31.357Z","Two Heads for the Price of One","<p>Set #9571 Fangdam: Another great spinner, this one comes with, Fangdam's Character card, Crushing Bolt, Fire Fields, Crown of Fire and Unsteady cards for the Ninjago game. The spinner is a nice black and translucent red with scale pattern and a translucent red crown with more snaky scales printed on. It looks great.</p>
<p>Fangdam is a member of the Fangpyre tribe, second only to Fangtom, and like his brother he has two heads. A very impressive sculpt for a head piece. His torso is a double-printed one with scale pattern that matches the top of the print on his neck, and he's got leg printing as well. Mostly red he has white arms and hands, this is a great looking Mini-Figure. There are two orange bricks and a square plate as a card holder, these pieces are too few for any serious MOCing, but they are a welcome change from the typical colors these pieces come in.</p>
<p>Fangdam includes a standard mace weapon, a white serpent or Sly Viper according to the Ninjago Character Encyclopedia and his gold weapon is known as the Golden Staff of Control, according to the book it's a very powerful weapon. There's a spare gold piece as well, in case you lose one or want to use it in building a different type of weapon.</p>
<p>Overall this spinner is a great bargain, it comes with some very cool looking weapons and cards, the spinner itself is a great mix of colors with some brilliant printing and Fangdam is just an awesome Mini-Figure. The head piece alone is just so unique, and the printing on it is top notch. I strongly recommend tracking this one down, but I also caution you to avoid crazy E-Bay prices. The inclusion of a white serpent/viper weapon is a huge bonus.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
