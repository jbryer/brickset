"Dragon_Master_48","2012-05-23T00:20:47.14Z","Cole Reaches Full Potential!","<p>Recently released, <strong>9572 NRG Cole</strong> is one of four spinner sets released with the full potential form of the ninjas:&nbsp; <strong>9570 NRG-Jay</strong>, <strong>9591 Weapon Pack</strong>, <strong>9590 NRG Zane</strong> (which has not yet been released), and this set. It is a very strong spinner, and, in my opinion, holds its place among the best of the Ninjago Spinners</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Exclusive NRG Cole figure.</li><li>Newly redesigned Scythe of Quakes is ready to reap any opponents.</li><li>Magnificant character card artwork.</li><li>Unique and appealing spinner and crown design.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Rather simple spear and staff.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this set is worth the money, and any LEGO Ninjago might want to purchase this set. </p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-11-15T19:02:50.953Z","Cole Advances in Training","<p>Set #9572 NRG Cole: As far as I can determine NRG Cole is a unique Mini-Figure found only in the Ninjago Spinner assortment and represents power above the ZX form found in most Serpentine sets and the Kendo form.</p>
<p>Ninjago Spinners are a bit pricey, however well worth investing in for fans of Ninjago MFs and of course the game involved with them. This spinner's real selling point though is definitely the Mini-Figure as it is the only method for obtaining him at this time. And what a Mini-Fig, this character looks breath taking. He is all black with an electric red printing running all over his torso, front and back, as well as his legs and even his face. NRG Cole appears to represent living energy in LEGO form.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of the new hat/ninja mask piece they've introduced with the Ninjago Theme, in 2011 they just used the old school Castle Ninja Theme masks, but for 2012 they introduced a much nicer looking piece. It means he can't hold a weapon clipped to his back, however it isn't that big of a loss when you have the new shoulder armor to use. Sadly the NRG forms don't seem to include that bit.</p>
<p>Accessories wise his three weapons are a bit, plain, compared to the Slithraa and Jay ZX Booster Packs I've picked up, even Bytar has a bit more impressive weapons. NRG Cole comes with an ordinary Kingdoms Era Spear colored dark stone gray (I think), a brown staff we've seen many times over and a golden scythe. Really the best weapon out of this set is that scythe, it does not appear to be the Quake Scythe though.</p>
<p>The Spinner looks great, the&nbsp;crown on it is a golden piece with the scythe printed on each of the four corners. The card stand pieces are just a black 2x2 plate and two smoke clear 2x2 bricks, which are kind of a rarity I believe. The five cards are: NRG Cole's Character Card, Master Archer, Snake Quake, Provoke Anger and Sensei's Teatime. Again I do not know specifics of card types, but they are addictive as far as collectibles go.</p>
<p>Overall if you're interested in a complete set of MFs from the Ninjago Theme then you can't pass up getting this spinner, for the target audience the spinners are all around great fun with endless hours of play time, and for MF collectors on a budget they are worth tracking down.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
