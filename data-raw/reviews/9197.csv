<p>Moving on let us begin with the price. Something I neglected to comment on with my Jay ZX Booster Pack review. Ninjago Spinners prices are a bit high for what you get in my honest opinion, we're asked to pay 12.99 for these things and really that seems like such a high price to pay for just getting the Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>It does however count as a bargain when compared to the high costs of most Ninjago sets which feature these Mini-Figures, if you're on a budget and yet strongly desire to pick up these Ninjago Mini-Figures the Spinners and Booster Packs are ideal. Just try to avoid Toy's-R-Us if you can, there they cost 13.99$ and that's before taxes. Sadly, at this late stage of the year and with Spinners and Booster Packs constantly selling out it would appear I had little choice in the matter.</p>
<p>What you get: The piece count is listed at 20 pieces, I've counted the number of pieces and honestly... There are 15 actual LEGO pieces in this set, counting the extra 1x1 stud for the Hypnobarai Staff, the other five 'pieces' are apparently the cards. Definitely a bit pricey, but is it worth it? Well all together you get some pretty interesting items in this little set, the character of course in MF form, Slithraa, three types of weapons, the Hypnobarai Staff as I mentioned a Hypno Viper in transparent blue (I'm not sure if that is the typical color for these serpents.), a Chain Sai (according to Ninjago CE) and of course Slithraa's personal spinner. There is also a Card Stand, but it isn't much.</p>
<p>The weapons are neat looking accessories, I'm particularly impressed by the Hypnobarai Staff and the transparent blue Hypno Viper, but the Chain Sai looks suitably menacing as well and probably dangerous with it whipping about in the MFs hand while he's spinning. I definitely caution you not to get to close, you could injure your eye.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is highly detailed, with scaled printing on the front and back of the torso, as well as running down the legs, and the head piece. It's gorgeous, I've been itching to get my hands on some of these rare Serpent themed MF heads and LEGO has not dissapointed. I believe Slithraa is the leader of the Hypnobarai Tribe of Serpentine according to the mythology.</p>
<p>These spinner things are addictive fun to play with, spinning them around is great fun even if you aren't trying to play the game, considering how tough it is to get them to work as intended I'm not surprised. The detail work on the crown is interesting too and the fact that you can incorporate it into a LEGO build of some kind is a nice touch.</p>
<p>The cards, you get five cards, which from what I understand is to add more challenge to the game than simply just spinning away and seeing who knocks who out first. This pack includes Slithraa's Character Card, Gates of Ice, Spirit Guard, Wrong Turn and Even the Odds. I still don't know enough about the cards or what type is what to explain that part of it, however I felt sharing the names this time would help. I am really impressed with the collectibilty and design of these cards.</p>
<p>Overall I am pleased that I took a chance on getting the Spinners, the game involved with them looks and sounds like a ton of fun, so there's a great deal of playability involved for the target age group. And depending on your preferences it can be just as fun to fool around with for AFOLs. The inclusion of a varied assortment of weapons, and the improved nature of the spinners (I've heard the initial 2011 spinners weren't as well recieved as the newer 2012 ones.) make this a strongly recommended pick-up for fans of the game, the series, the character of Slithraa and the Mini-Figures in general if you're budget concious.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
