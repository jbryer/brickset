He has 3 weapons, and a cool spinner. Onwards!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are not many parts, its is a ninjago spinner though, but its still cool. The main higllight is NRG zane, who is exclusive. he has white hands and light blue everything else, even his face is light blue though (what is he, white skinned then drunk some collodial silver? lol) but anyway, his weapons are silver katana, a sythe of quakes coloured&nbsp;grey and&nbsp;white and a golden pole with a chain that has a shuriken and knife at the end. Weird weapon indeed. The last pieces are the spinner, silver on bottom and trans clear on top with an ice patteren. The crown is trans also, with more ice pattern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Build</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well.... theres not much to build. Its a figure and a weapon. Not much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Set</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Its a nice spinner, its got a lot of charm to it and its fun to spin, a lot more than the 2011 ones (which i only bought 2 because of how bad they were) and glan that they no longer use chinese plastic. The sad news is their price goes up. :( But&nbsp;i digress, the set is actually pretty good. Its a good range of weapons and pieces and you wanot regret buying it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Overall</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As my first reviwed spinner (fangdam was the first 2012 one i bought) i am pleasantly suprised in the up quality of the spinners. The pieces are good, but when i comes to playability, one other spinners all you need to have a whole lotta fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4/5</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.S Check out my slithraa review too... and my thoughts on him</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-31T18:21:57.203Z","Shurikens of Ice","<p>Set #9590 NRG Zane: Ninjago Spinners are part of the LEGO Ninjago game, a big part, kids enjoy collecting the sets for the vehicles and many awesome Mini-Figures. Some however get a kick out of all the Spinners, these things are such good sellers as they are pretty much sold out at most stores in my area. (And once again I'm late to the collecting party.)</p>
<p>The LEGO Ninjago Spinner game is, well I'm going to say it sounds like great fun, as an AFOL I don't really play the game. But I can't help spinning the spinners around and seeing how far they'll travel across my desk before colliding with an object or sliding off of it. Still, the Spinners don't offer much for LEGO builders outside of playing the game. NRG Zane's includes a nice clear white crown piece with some printed silver detailing, and a transparent blue/silver spinner with some printing to show off the powering up effect that Zane has undergone when attaining the level of NRG Ninja.</p>
<p>This set includes the following five cards for the Ninjago Spinner Game: NRG Zane's Character Card, Spin-o-Rama, Diamond Coated, Crumble to Dust and Snowblind. The cards add an extra level of play for the game, and an extra level of addictiveness for collectors. There are a total of 125 cards given out through all of the Spinners, Booster Packs and Spinner Related Items such as the Weapons Pack or Starter Set, these cards are a nice thick stock material and feature excellent and even exciting looking artwork. Some are foiled, looking metallic, while others are simply plain unadorned cards. All-in-all I'm sure a lot of parents have heard kids demanding for more spinners to collect them all, because these cards are pretty impressive. It's just unfortuante that I also believe they count towards the piece count of the set. Or at least some times I think they might, it's hard to tell honestly as counting every single piece included in the Spinners tends to come up a bit short sometimes without adding the cards to it too. (The cards also get a few pieces dedicated to them, a square white plate and two clear 2x2 bricks are used to build a small stand for holding the cards upright during game play.)</p>
<p>NRG Zane is a really great bargain for fans of the weapons in the Ninjago line, not only does he come with a silver katana, but he also includes a buildable Scythe using standard colored pieces instead of the gold ones used to build the Scythe of Quakes, a Golden Dagger (though really Two as they come in a set.) His Shurikens of Ice, both of them, and using one of the Shurikens of Ice and Golden Daggers along with a chain and gold lightsaber blade you can build the Golden Chained Fang. (According to the Ninjago Character Encyclopedia.) This is a pretty great deal, kids can make the Golden Chained Fang or give Zane his Shurikens instead, so it's pretty cool as this is one of the only Spinners to actually give the Ninja his Elemental Weapon.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mini-Figures, NRG Zane is outstanding, he has achieved the highest level of Spinjitzu you can reach without the 2013 Weapons, and his Mini-Figure just looks quite unique. He's all one color of baby blue, with white hands, then comes the printing to add details. Electrical energy is crackling all around him, with a double-sided print on his torso and printing on his legs. His face is surrounded by a white boarder with silver inside of it drawing your eye to, well, the eyes. And a serious looking white mouth completes the look. He also has the great new mask piece LEGO introduced with this year of Ninjago sets. (Or last year if you live in a time zone where 2013 has begun.)</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great looking little item for Mini-Figure fans on a budget, looking to score the awesome NRG Zane. It's a great addition to the kids who collect and play the Spinjitzu game, and you really can't go wrong with something this cheap for getting the Shurikens of Ice. I believe the only other way to get those weapons cheaply would be to pick up the Zane ZX Booster Pack, and that is very hard to come by at this late stage of the game. Strongly reccomended.</p>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,4
