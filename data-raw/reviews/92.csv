It also has numbers zero through nine for both the left and right sides of the helmet.  If you collect several lego hockey sets, you can start exchanging pieces to make whatever team look you want, and these stickers will really come in handy for that.

As for the figure itself:  There are two basic kinds of stick action for these:  The &quot;swing&quot; action, used here and in the 'puck passer' and 'flip shot' sets, and the &quot;twist&quot; action used on the 'goalie' and 'slap shot' sets.
The twist action is much better, as the swing action gets less effective after the head is slammed a few times.  I've tried to correct this problem with Lego parts, but it looks like it may take some gorilla glue instead.  Parts can be improvised to convert between the two, except for the stick.  So you're pretty much stuck buying a twist-action player to get the better function, though you could swap parts for the look you want.

The multiple shoulder pieces here are a nice bonus--you get six different colors; enough to supply multiple figures.  But the players that use the Bionicle-type shoulders need some different pieces to wear these shoulders.  I found those pieces in the tiny hockey sets--there's one used in the goal, and two used for one of players' hands.

I don't know if emails are allowed here, but I'd love to exchange pieces, stickers (need Blue Jackets), and tips.  I'm in the US; email me at markschmidt@hotmail.com",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
