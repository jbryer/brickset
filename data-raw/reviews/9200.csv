<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2012-05-23T00:08:20.89Z","The Battle Begins!!","<p><strong>9591 Battle Pack</strong>, or <strong>NRG Kai vs. Chokun</strong>, is unlike many of the other spinners sets (including the equally expensive starter packs): As well as including spinners (and crowns, with the new 2012 Ninjago Spinner line), this set also includes blades and shields. It also has some extra weapons, instead of the usual three-per-character.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>NRG Kai figure is exclusive to this set. Chokun only appears in one other set</li><li>Includes blades and shields for the spinners.</li><li>Extra weapons for more firepower (no pun intended).</li><li>Artwork on the character cards, especially NRG Kai's, is magnificant.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Chokun has shorter legs, putting him at a disadvantage against NRG Kai.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a wonderful set, and a great addition to both my spinner and LEGO collections; I would recommend this to any fan of Ninjago!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
