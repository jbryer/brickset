"jeroenaa95","2012-07-04T05:54:20.9Z","cool set, a must-have.","<p>I ordered this set on a dutch website, because I live in the Netherlands. It was on sale for €124,99. It is a good price for this set, but the original price is a bit too much. The original price is €150,00. That is just too much for a 1092 piece set. It comes with 6 minifigs and a 60 cm long ship, the Malevolence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I will do the minifigs:</p>
<p>General Grievous: </p>
<p>He is the same in General Grievous' starfighter. I don't have that set, so this is my first General Grievous. He is a great minifig. He has his 4 lightsabers and a very awesome head. He is not very acurate to the ""real"" one in the clone wars, but he still is very cool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battle droid:</p>
<p>He is the same as every other battle droid, with one straight arm and&nbsp;one bend arm. He has&nbsp;the same&nbsp;blaster as every other battle droid or clone trooper, stormtrooper and a lot of other soldiers in all the six movies and TV-series. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battle droid commander:</p>
<p>He is a new minifigure and my first commander. He is different than the old commander, that one had an entire yellow body and this one has only a yellow dot on his body and yellow markings on his head. He also has a normal blaster. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Padmé Amidala: </p>
<p>She is a new minifigure and she is pretty cool. I like the ""real"" Padmé better, but she looks pretty much the same. She has a new hairpiece, that is cool. She has a small blaster pistol. Her face is not very pretty. It is a little bit male-like with make up. She does have printing on her torso. There is printing on each side of her torso. She doesn't have legprinting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Count Dooku:</p>
<p>He is the same Dooku in Count Dooku's solar sailer. I don't have that set, so this is my first Count Dooku. He has his bend red lightsaber. He also has a cape and nice printing on his torso, no legprinting. He has the same hair piece as chancelor Palpatine, but in a different color. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anakin Skywalker:</p>
<p>He is the same old Ani as usually. He is the Anakin in his starfighter and clone turbo tank and a lot of other sets, but not the Anakin in the sith nightspeeder. He has printed armor in the front, no backprinting or legprinting. He has his blue lightsaber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the set now:</p>
<p>The Malevolence is a very large ship in the clone wars, it is much larger than the republic cruisers. But in Lego's they are almost the same size. There are 18 stickers in this set, but I dont think that is a big problem. There are two control panels and two holo-projectors or something like that. There is 1&nbsp;seat for a droid. General Grievous stands behind the other controll panel. There is no place to store the lightsabers or guns. On each side there is 1 big-ass cannon, that is supposed to be the ion cannon, but it are six flickfire missles. That is not cool. In the back of the ship there are 2 little trains. That are nice details. It does have some nice details on top of the ship. There is a lever in the ship, so you can easily pick it up. The front of the ship is closed, but it can easily open up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall it is a very nice set. There is a lot of building, but it isn't hard. It is aged 9-14, but I think an 8-year-old could easily build it. For adults it is a nice set, but it could have been a little bit larger. It is must have for every clone wars fan. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"plantman","2012-09-03T04:46:05.903Z","One of the few Lego sets I finished stepped back and thought ""oh... it's so... average""","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with all of the bigger ships, especially with a 1092 piece count, I was excited for this set.&nbsp; Some time during the build, I could feel the disappointment brewing.&nbsp; As I progressed through the build it started to feel smaller and just plain bland.&nbsp; By the time I slapped on the stickers for the window sections I could see it wasn't at the same level of some other big ships.&nbsp; I couldn't&nbsp;help but think the overall build could have been achieved with a lot less pieces.&nbsp; This was all reconfirmed when I placed it next to the other ships in my collection and just that to myself ""is that it?"".&nbsp; This could have been alieviated somewhat by the figure pack-ins (i know some purists aren't keen on the attention level minifigs get, by I have a soft spot for the brick figures) but sadly... it falls short there as well.&nbsp; I already have all the figures from other sets - Anakin, Dooku, Battle Droids, Grievous - I think Senator Padme is new, but it's not a figure&nbsp;I care about, especially as a Clone Wars incarnation.&nbsp; I will sum up by saying that I have 100 sq. ft. of total display shelving for my Lego sets and as my collection grows, I have to decide what is going back into bags and into storage.&nbsp; This set will be one of the first to go.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

"Ypres","2013-02-26T19:35:49.613Z","The Epitome of the Phrase; ""Passion of Love""","<p>What's understandably the most scrutinized aspect about this set is its price. When&nbsp;I refrence a set's&nbsp;'price'&nbsp;I'm not speaking&nbsp;of it's 'value', the two are distinctly different since the former word refers to the retailer's asking price and the latter word is&nbsp;speculation of after-market selling price. With a hefty price tag of $120US ($150CAN) the Malevolence is well above what I would expect anyone to pay... let alone demand in the after-market sites. The Lego designers treated this set like it was their fixer-up Harley and sunk way too much time and pieces into making this model presentable. I don't expect this set to ever garner an aggressive after-market value, and I'd place its value somewhere around $100 US in the current market (where it's readily available). Retailers are noticebly having a harder time moving the set, and I was fortunate to spot the Malevolence on sale in Canada between $90-100 on two seperate occasions.</p><p>It's apparent I didn't rate this set highly, and while you might assume my opening rant was the reason and/or justification for such cynicism, you'd best inquire a little further into the schematics of the set. The Malevolence is rather&nbsp;petite. There was a time when Lego filled their oversized boxes with 50% air like they were a bag of Lay's potato chips, and reminiscent of that era we're once again the beholder to something utterly deceptive. The most exciting part of this set was the box, and apart from their actually being a fair number of pieces, the finished product (the Malevolence) isn't at all something to admire. Quite honestly it pales in comparison to similarly priced models like the Star Destroyer. I know its size is one thing, and often times&nbsp;parents value its playability more. I actually really appreciated the fact that there was a handle on the top... although it was seemingly more useful for moving the ship in a display as opposed to making it 'swooshable' for children due to its awkward location. The opening components on the ship are nothing short of laughable. Compared to how roomy the Star Destroyer felt the Malevolence barely passes with the comfort level of a coffin. </p><p>This set has more than enough room for improvement. The flickfire missiles, which I don't normally object to, were arduously contructed out of many small technic pins and parts, then made completely obsolete by shoving a&nbsp;clear dome over them. You'd really have to build the set yourself to fully understand what I mean when I say the flickfire feature was completely redundant and a big waste of parts. While&nbsp;on the discussion of wasted pieces and missed opportunity, the Malevolence would've been a lot better off with its own stand. It's barely a recognizable ship even among Starwars fans, and no one is going to give it a second glance when it's among other Starwars ships. Even for me, who watched Clone Wars (etc), I felt giving it a Ultimate Collectors' Series style stand with nameplate could've made this set pop. In fact, I found that adding two of the old monorail stands gave it a lot more depth. I guess to add insult to injury, or to lose that battle in the air and on land; you have to throw a few more sticks and stones at the minifigures. Why obsess about the minifigure selection? I do it because it greatly governs the value of the set and it's another understandable reason why this set is undistinguishable among others. I already own General Grievous, and I'm not tickled by the fact that his minifigure is only decreasing in value... although he was an obvious choice for this set. Run of the mill characters like Anakin and the Battle Droid were space fillers, and the so called 'new' figures Padme and the Commander Battle Droid really don't contribute much value or excitement either. When so many Starwars sets are getting all new minifigures I can't understand why they gave the Malevolence the short end of the stick with the recycled hoard of generic minifigures.</p><p>If you're on the fence, I would seriously recommend you think twice about buying this set. If you're still not won over by the the detailed pictures on Lego.com or Brickset, then I suggested you pass on this set. The reviews vary from average to low for a reason, and unfortunately the price wasn't right for this set and we can't project a good value for it in the future. I suppose if you've got space to fill, money to burn, and a passion for applying stickers on to plastic blocks, this is the set for you. The Malevolence wasn't built to my liking, but like many others, I was enticed by the&nbsp;illusion I was getting it for a great deal.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,2,2
"lee_fett1980","2013-08-22T08:28:14.18Z","On the whole I'd say pretty decent","<p>I understand the criticism of this set at the RRP but I got it for £70 and had a voucher so actually only paid half that. No I wouldn't pay £100 for it and I wouldn't recommend anyone else does, however if you can buy the set for a discount then I think it's a decent set.<br><br>It's a fun build with some really good minifigures.&nbsp; I really like the way the top can come off as well to open up the main body of the ship, I thought that was a really good design feature.&nbsp; The handle makes it easy to carry it around as well.<br><br>I wasn't keen on the engines at the back, Lego have chosen to go with lots of little engines but you do look at them and think there's no way all those little things could power this great ship.&nbsp; It'd be like attaching 20 fans to the back of your car, never going to work!<br><br>The torpedos at the side are good though, I like the way they're closed off and the way they fire.&nbsp; And the way the side sections fold down to close the ship off are quite good.<br><br>Yes there could be a few improvements, the ship could look a bit more impressive, maybe be a bit bulkier, however if they did that they'd charge more and as others have said it's already overpriced at the RRP. I'd quite like to see a UCS version that could be of the size and magnitude it should be, although I don't see it happening as I don't think this set's been an amazing success.<br><br>Overall though, if you can get it for roughly £70 I think you'll enjoy it. More than that? Maybe save your money for something a little more impressive.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"arl100","2012-09-09T14:26:16.527Z","Perhaps a UCS Malevolence would have been better","<p>Decided to buy this because, at the time, reviews were generally favourable to the Malevolence. The proper ship looked absolutely amazing and thought ""Lego's version should be OK too"". Perhaps not a bad spend, particularly as I found it at a better price, but you should be looking for better detail and a greater number of pieces for your money. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, the ship does feel quite compact, but at 2ft long, it isn't precisely small (especially if, like me, you need to cycle what you display due to lack of room)and does look like a reasonable model from the outside. The interior is the letdown, in a few ways:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Controls at the front of the ship, rather than enlarging the bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>-Tiny train tracks, goes no more than about 2-3 inches.</p><p>-No detailed interior, such as corridors or other rooms of the ship.</p>

<ul><li>Cramped interior.</li><li>Not masses of good detail on the exterior either.</li><li>Overpriced for the quality of the set.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lego would have been wise to shelve this idea for another year or so and instead focus on a&nbsp; UCS Malevolence, higher price but far greater detail.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Malevolence was a powerful ship from the Clone Wars, and feared by the Republic. But does it&#39;s Lego form hold up?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box like the&nbsp;instructions have dearth maul on the top, and the box sports a image of the minifigures on the right side. The only new minifigues are Padm&eacute; and a new version of a B-1 Battle Droid Commander. The instructions are&nbsp;standard, and are easy to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are nice, with dark blue parts&nbsp;that might be useful for&nbsp;separatist MOCs. Normal&nbsp;colors for Separatists. While the parts in this set are not a primary aspect of this set, they can be quite useful for making other separatist vessels not represented in Lego form.&nbsp;I am not an expert on specific parts, but I do not feel any parts are unique to this set other then Padm&eacute;&#39;s Hair piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nice. The figures of Grievous and Dooku&nbsp;(in The Clone Wars forms)&nbsp;only come with this set and their respective starfighters. Grievous is a spectacular figure, with great detail and looks very impressive next to the other figures. His arms are designed well, and it is much better then his 2005/2007 appearances. He also appears in this form in 8095.&nbsp;Count&nbsp;Dooku&nbsp;is the same minifigure&nbsp;as the one 7752. He has the same hair peice as Chancellor Palpatine in 8039-1, and has a curved chrome lightsaber&nbsp;whitch is the same in all of his appearences as a minifigure.&nbsp;Two B1 Battle droids come with it, one being&nbsp;a Commander. The battle droid commander has a yellow dot on it&#39;s chest piece, this being it&#39;s only new piece. Padm&eacute; I feel is low quality, but only for the face, which looks surprisingly poor for a Lego figure. Anakin Skywalker is the same minifigure&nbsp;that has appeared in this subtheme &nbsp;since 2008. A minifigure not included that I feel should have been included is Obi-Wan, as he could duel Grievous, and was prominent in the Malevolence Arc of The Clone Wars.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is good, and while the completed model is very sturdy, the front of the ship feels fragile until step 33. It is quite easy to rebuild if it gets broken, and is usually sturdy, and allows you to log it up while building to get another angle, or to repair a piece that has fallen off. The build around the Ion Cannon is kind of annoying</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is impressive, and looks great from the outside. The inside is okay, but not exceptional. I like the inclusion of a train system. The Ion Cannon is a nice feature but the missiles can only fire a short distance. The model does not fall apart easily, and the &quot;train&quot; system that is used in the show is a nice feature.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this ship is a great model. The ship is very well constructed&nbsp;and can be flown easily using the handle, although I find it a bit too small, it could not be bigger without intruding into the model too much. A problem this ship has, is not itself, but the fact that it is not to scale with other star ships, such as 8039-1. This is due to the ship&#39;s massive size in the show, and is no fault of the designers. If you want to pit size accurate Venator Class Star Destroyers against it, use smaller versions found in the polybag&nbsp;30053.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel this ship is a great buy, and can balance the other more prominent Republic Vehicles released. If you can find it for under $100, I would strongly recommend buying it as as of this point, has been out for almost 4 years.</p>

"Andersond","2017-11-20T03:41:36.13Z","The mighty warship, the malevolence ","<p>I got this set for Christmas in 2012, and have know decided to review this set. &nbsp;This is one of the most powerful ships during the clone wars, and it was finally made by Lego. When I got this set, it did not disappoint at all. It comes with six minifigures, Anakin Skywalker,&nbsp;Count Dooku, Padme, General Grievous, Battle Droid, and Battle Droid Commander.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anakin&nbsp;Skywalker:</p>

<p>This is the same version of Skywalker that has come in almost every other clone wars set. He comes with a lightsaber, and has no back head printing, nor any back printing. He is good minifigure&nbsp;to get, however I would not get the set just for him since he comes in many other cheaper sets.</p>

<p>Count Dooku:</p>

<p>Dooku&nbsp;came first came out in 2009 in the Solar Sailor&nbsp;ship, and&nbsp;this&nbsp;version of him is the same one that had come out in 2009. He comes with a silver curved lightsaber&nbsp;hilt, and has no back printing or back printing at all. He does come with a cape too</p>

<p>Padme:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first version of Padme that we have got in the clone wars style she is the one of the new figures from this set. She has no&nbsp;printing on the other side of her head, but does have back printing on her torso. She comes with a small blaster, as well. A lot of people do not like her face at all. I will have to admit that it does not look the best, but it is not that bad. This is&nbsp;the only set to get her in her Clone Wars outfit</p>

<p>Grievous:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Dooku, this is the second set that you can get Grievous&nbsp;in. The figure still looks amazing&nbsp;and is by far the best figure in this set. He comes with all four lightsabers, but does not come with his blaster. His face has a slightly different look to is, but this is a very subtle change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battle Droid commander:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is second and last of the new figures form this set and, by far is the&nbsp;best version we have got, from Lego. They got rid of the solid body colour and went back to the yellow dot on the torso&nbsp;and on the head. This is a great figure to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;your Droid armies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battle Droid:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last figure in this set is the battle droid. He is just the foot soldier&nbsp;of the Droid armies, so it is always nice to get more droids to add to your army. He is just like the rest of the Droid mini-figures, and there is not much else with him that is new&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>The build was a lot of fun and was fairly easy. There was not a lot of hard steps to take in this set. The instructions are easy to follow, and a kid at the age of 9 would not have a hard time building it. For me the build was enjoyable, however when I got mine, it did not have the stickers, which&nbsp;did not make the ship feel complete. However once I got the stickers for it the ship looked great.</p>

<p>Completed model:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ship when finished looks great. The entire top of the front of the ship can come off for easy access inside. In the front of the ship is the bridge. The bridge has Grievous&rsquo; Command station for him to command the ship from, and in front of him is a chair for a Droid to sit in and control the ship. There is a view screen in front of the droids chairs and both command posts have a sloped tile with a very detailed sticker on it. The next part of the ship are the two massive ion canons.&nbsp;Then once you fire the first shot, you then have to turn the wheel to get to the next missile. This is a very fun play feature and Lego did a good job with recreating the ion cannons from the show.myou do not have to open the front of the ship up, to fire the ion cannon. However, I will say that when you open the ship up to play inside, you do see the mechanism for the ion cannon. This is not a problem, but they decided to use bright yellow and blue, for the pins, it would have been nice to just get gray, and red to match the colour of the inside&nbsp;of the ship, however this is not that hard to do. One final note about the front of the ship is that you can fit all the figures and more in the front of the ship. You can at lest fit 8-10 figures inside. In the bad part of the ship you can open both the top and bottom sides of then ship. Inside you have a two trains (one per side)&nbsp;that run on these smooth tiles. This is supposed to represent the massive railway inside the ship. The trains however can only go so far. One of the trains has a tool box on it carrying a wrench and a hammer. You can fit a few figures in this area, however you have to have the ship open to fit them in. Unlike the front of the ship they will not fit when you close the ship up. On the top of the back area of the ship site the bridge. The bridge is not figure scaled, but besides that is looks great. At the very back of the ship are the engines. There are 16 engines on the ship. They look very simple, however they look fantastic on the ship when you turn it around.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall:&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of people do not like this set because of two things, the first I&rsquo;d the size and the second is the figures. People want this set to be huge, and they want it to be in scale with the other cruiser ships. However, this is impossible for Lego to do. They cannot make it the correct size, because if they did it would be longer than a house. For what Lego could do the size is great. The figures however are good but not the best. A lot of people wanted figures, that would have made the set good, but were not in the episode. Personally I would want winter battle Droid and perhaps Obi wan. This would help out the set a lot more. If you were to get this set or jabba&rsquo;s palace, most people would go with Jabba&nbsp;because it comes with better figures then the malevolence. If you are a clone wars fan, a separatist fan, them this is a must-have. For everybody else I would say that this set may not be perfect or be the best, but is&nbsp;worth your money&nbsp;</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-22T14:18:37.48Z","A hard compromise for a beautiful cruiser","<p>This is one of those sets i haven&#39;t had the opportunity to take back in 2012 when it first came out on the shelves, but i&#39;ve&nbsp;bought it recently finishing my dark age away from Lego. Coming directly from one of the first sagas from The clone wars tv series, this ship was introduced pretty well as a giant badass coupled with an ion can! (as the one we see in The empire strikes back&quot;). That was very hyping at first, with the Malevolence annihilating Plo Koon&#39;s&nbsp;entire fleet and then sending droids to let no survivors so that it could remain a secret weapon!&nbsp;But being destroyed after just two more episodes while trying to destroy a clone medical station&nbsp;didn&#39;t really help it becoming an iconic ship. When it came out, people preferred the Darth Malgus minifigure&nbsp;with his overpriced ship or Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;Palace, again an overpriced playset&nbsp;with awesome minifigures. From that year on, The Clone Wars sets were in decline (maybe less people watched the show while it was becoming more cool or maybe because the iconic vehicles&nbsp;were all&nbsp;already&nbsp;done), since there were released fewer sets each year till it was ended in 2014. This ship was strongly criticed&nbsp;for&nbsp;being too little and without cool minifigures, coupled with a high price. But i personally think it&#39;s worth to take a better look at close, because it&#39;s a very interesting set.</p>

<p>It consisted of 1092 pieces and 6 minifigures&nbsp;and retailed back then for 120&nbsp;US$/EU. Nowadays&nbsp;it&#39;s often on sale brand-new for 150-200 $ (i was lucky to find it used but in good shape just like new for only 80EU&nbsp;with box and instructions).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start saying that the&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;selection is average. There&#39;s not too many, not any new and cool one (except Padme, which is not really an interesting addition), and no re-design for the ugly-looking face Anakin or Dooku. But i think these characters bounded all together in the same set are a nice bundle, especially for play. Also both Grievous and Dooku, being some of the most powerful characters in the tv series, were pretty rare, since this was the second and last time they were released. So not so bad afterall, although&nbsp;some more would not have made this worse.</p>

<p>The ship has a flaw: the size. It&#39;s just not an impressive and dreadful size, which should be his main feature really. But looking closer you&#39;ll see all the details which covers the surfice: the lenght resembles his 5km long shape very well, and the design it&#39;s really awesome, especially from the side (from the front it&#39;s just not so interesting). The bridge is epic, as do the engines on the back.&nbsp;There it starts to shine. Compared to some bigger ships like the republic Venator, this one did not sacrificed&nbsp;his aesthetic&#39;s faith to the screen counterpart for playability purpouse. Of course not having any rotatable turrets on top does not help, but the Malevolence does come with a twin-ion cannon, represented with a 6-flick fire missiles covered by a dome. Which works kinda well, but it&#39;s not so incredible or cool. There&#39;s a handle on top for helping you moving it, it works kinda good but not too much, being somewhat flimsy. To get to the main bridge you have to remove the front section, which it&#39;s not really connected to the main frame but just leaned firmly&nbsp;on it. The interior is another compromise, being nice while not top best and also having some space to play around the command centre and the wheeling chair for the pilot. Also exposed&nbsp;ion cannons with their technic pieces are not so good. The interior on the rear sections is able to be opened&nbsp;very well with hatches top and bottom, but here on the other hand there&#39;s almost no space to play around. It&#39;s just a long smooth tile on which it runs the red train, you gain two one per side. I like the inclusion of the train, faithful to the tv series, but it would have been better to couple it with&nbsp;more boxes to storage, instead you gain only one and already occupied by some tools.</p>

<p>So all in all i think there&#39;s been quite some compromise here. It&#39;s not&nbsp;just a very cool and well designed&nbsp;cruiser shrinked in size. The playfeatures&nbsp;are not so bad, but there&#39;s only a few and they are pretty boring and little, the main one really is just the cannon. The minifigures are certainly not awesome, but at the same time i think they form a very playable and nice bundle on their own. I think it&#39;s great to play on the surfice&nbsp;since the interior isn&#39;t really big, maybe some space duels with breathing helmets to repair or assault it and rescue some prisoners, that&#39;s the best way to play it!&nbsp;For roughtly&nbsp;100-120 US$/EU seems fair, just don&#39;t spend more. Anyway i recommand it, especially&nbsp;for TCW fans being a very cool separatist&nbsp;ship. I feel this vessel deserved more space, i would love to see this in UCS in the future. Maybe the tv series failed to make this an iconic ship, but certainly Lego design did justice to this cruiser&nbsp;and to me it&#39;s one of the better designed/cool looking set from TCW subtheme.</p>
