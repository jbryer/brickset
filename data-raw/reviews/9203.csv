"zipsforbananas","2012-06-01T18:27:51.873Z","Iconic! Great figures, great playability, but not quite worth the price.","<p>I must apologise for my previous review of this set - I took it as a chance to rant about Lego's extortionate pricing of Star Wars sets, and so got a few deserved poor votes. I have since succumbed, although only with a 20% discount, and I do like it!<br>(And after all this time there's only a mammoth essay and a short bit of prose reviewing it, so I'm renovating my review to be something a little more useful in between the two!)</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that has to be discussed with this set simply has to be the <b>figures</b>!</p><p><b>Chewie</b> is the same as always, as he kinda has to be, but with a set of hancuffs on himthat you do get a spare of.</p><p><b>Han</b> is a great update of the Slave I version: the carbonite shell is the same, as are his clothes, but he's got great squinting eyes on one side of his face and a bit of an unimpressed look on the other. It had to be that way, the carbonite and his clothes couldn't have changed, and his hibernation sickness left him blind so everything feels just right!</p><p>It's all uphill from here; <b>Leia</b> as Boushh is simply stunning! She's very nicely printed on her legs and back, has two great expressions (happy to see Han, and horrified at being caught), nice hair for when her helmet's off, and a fantastic helmet with great moulding and printing. And you get a great little thermal detonator for her to hold too, it's really nicely printed and you should well get a spare. I don't know how to display her as the face and hair are great, but the helmet looks great on her too. A nice dilemma to have!</p><p>The <b>B'omarr Monk</b>&nbsp;only just counts as a minifigure (or course Lego count it - they count the carbonite separately to Han to justify the price!!), and he's the same as he was in 4480, but he's great nonetheless, and that last run of sets was pretty poor so only collectors are likely to have him already. He's very cleverly made with the swords, and the orange brick looks wonderful being distorted by the clear dome. Overall he's wonderfully creepy - just right to make Threepio shudder!</p><p><b>Oola</b> carries on the great theme with printing front and back and on the legs, and a treat of moulded piece for the top of her head. And what about that colour! Fittingly for the great playability of the set she has a dancing and a screaming-as-she-falls-through-the-trapdoor face!</p><p>The <b>Gamorrean Guard</b> is such an improvement from the old one-shade mint green abominations! The moulding is really good and detailed, but the printing is the best bit. The colours are so deep, and every detail is well printed. His axe is suitably imposing with it's two pieces too.</p><p><b>Bib Fortuna</b> somehow seems less special where he'd be the highlight of any other set. He's only got front printing, but then he does have a cloak so there wouldn't be any point in any more. The face is delightful with his threatening bared teeth, and the headpiece is tremendously warty! The only problem is getting his headpiece in with the cloak - I had to put it on the head, and then slide the head and the cloak down together as the corner that gets formed in the cloak stops the head going on if you put the cloak in place first.</p><p>Again, with <b>Salacious B Crumb</b> Lego are again taking liberties with their minifigure count - he's only one piece. But what a great piece he is! His slouch and manic look are perfect, and he's flexible enough to fit anywhere.</p><p>And the cherry on top - at last, a great <b>Jabba</b>! Gone is the old toothpaste green, and in comes a great shade with lots of great printing - even the tattoo on his left arm! He's absolutely brilliant!</p><p><br></p><p>So, on to <b>the rest of the set</b>.</p><p>There are a couple of nice details before you've even started building. The instructions are backed by card as most larger ones are now; the figures are not all in bag one so you get to enjoy them throughout and not all in one go, which is especially nice as they are the best bit of the set; and joy of joys - no stickers! None at all! (Though there aren't many specially printed pieces either, just Leia's thermal detonator and the door droid.)</p><p><b>The build</b> is very enjoyable, and the entrance area starts to feel very substantial very quickly. There are some nice techniques with larger pieces filling gaps you'd noticed and wondered about, and the arches on the top of the tower being flared out to make it round. The set gets a little cumbersome to build in the main chamber, but when the arches go in it pulls things together nicely. It's a bit of a shame that one of the white pieces in the base is visible by the trapdoor, but that's the only slight gripe I have with that side of things.</p><p>You do get some great <b>pieces</b> with the set too. There are lots of arches, with some small ones that I don't think I've seen before, so they might be new. I've also not got any of the textured pillar pieces that there are a few of, and there are some very nice colours. The darker sand bricks don't feel half so rare after building this! There are two bricks in a shade of dark orange I've not seen before too. But some of the light tan pieces seem a little lighter than others; I wonder if there are some cheaper Chinese bricks in here.</p><p>The piece count seems quite low for the price, but a lot of the pieces are quite large. There are plenty of steep slope pieces in both shades of sand, large plates, and quite a few bricks that are 2x2 or larger. The geek-out moment for me parts wise was the 6x6 tile piece that goes into the trapdoor. I love it! It's only got underside 'reverse-studs' in the central 2x2 section so it stays put, but isn't too hard to press down or remove. And it, and the large curved roof sections, had a nice textured feel to them. It's worth mentioning they found a few nice ways to fit the new 4x1 plate with just the two studs at the end in too.</p><p>So with the build complete how does the <b>overall set</b> stack up? And what's the <b>playability</b> like? I have to say I'm halfway between impressed and disappointed in the overall thing. The disappointment is in the throne room which feels a little cramped. But then price is my big issue with the set so I hardly want them to make it bigger! The entrance tower certainly feels good, and has space for a corridor to run off it, perhaps for MOC dungeons and droid torture chambers (or maybe even future sets? Not sure how it would work with the Rancor Pit but we can hope!). The height adds something to the set, and it does look great from the door side, just like the exterior shot in the movie.</p><p>The <b>playability</b>&nbsp;however is through the roof! There's the guard tower with a gun and binoculars, and the storage tower with a gun crate and a bottle. The door has the door droid which can move out (I'm disappointed it's not round like in Jabba's Message, but it wouldn't slide if it were) and the whole thing slides up and is kept in place by a ratchet. That whole section can be detached, and the pins holding it in place seem very good quality - they're the longer Technic connectors with the stopper on the end, through a 1x2 Technic brick, rather than just a brick with the connector attached.</p><p>In the main part of the set the whole roof lifts off, the trap door slides open (I can't wait for the Rancor Pit to go underneath! Hopefully at a fairer price too.), and Jabba's throne moves forward to see through the grille floor. There's a stash of coins and guns under Jabba's throne, steps up to the side of his plinth, and some sort of oven behind him which opens up to give access to the back of the set. And the holder for Han in carbonite spins, so if you put him in back to front you can get Leia to thaw him and just spin him round for the bit where he falls out!</p><p>The only slight issues are the throne being so loose, it slides when you move the set, but I'm not sure how that could be improved. And the flick fire missile in the roof - why, Lego, why?!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Figures! They're fantastic - well moulded and printed</li><li>Jabba! What a beast! And Salacious Crumb is brilliant too.</li><li>The playability is marvellous; you can recreate so many film scenes - add R2-D2 C-3PO, and the figures from the Skiff set and you've got even more scope!</li><li>The size of it is really good, particularly the substantial thick base to the throne room.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I have to say it - the price! Such a shame as it's such a good set - find it in a sale!</li><li>Nothing much else! I mentioned a few niggles, but none of them detract significantly.</li></ul>
<p>So it turns out after all my moaning that I really love this set! The figures are truly tremendous, I think the Gamorrean guard is my current favourite. And it's so playable, or&nbsp;pose-able&nbsp;is you're going for an air of respectability! If the price doesn't seem wild to you then get it! The piece count is tiny for a £120 set; it's pretty low for a £95 set too, but the figures are simply the best Lego have ever produced for one set (in the Episode IV-VI range at least!) so the 20% off just about made it worth it for me.<br><br></p><p>(And apologies to Capn Rex for suggesting his review is too big - mine isn't so much smaller after all!)</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,1
"banarne2001","2012-06-02T07:10:31.787Z","Best set ever!","This is by far the coolest set I have ever owned! Sets like these are so often just skeletons of the buildings, but this one looks cool from all angles! Almost ucs-like design! The minifigures look great with superb details. Building this was never tedious, and the structure is rock solid. <br><br>Sure, it gets a bit crammed inside Jabba's throne room, but the playability is still well taken care of through the removeable parts which lets you access all areaes without risking tearing down parts of the structure.<br><br>I am no fan of missiles in strange places, and this set has one shooting from under the roof. Why? Still, this is the best lego set ever!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sudorum","2012-08-17T00:57:54.467Z","Jabba and Lego Drive Hard Bargains","<p>Jabba&#39;s Palace represents the best and worst of Lego. On one hand, we have an assortment of minifigures that staggers the senses and a surprisingly accurate depiction of an iconic Star Wars movie scene. It&#39;s undoubtedly the best Star Wars set of the year, and arguably one of the best of the decade. The new mini figures are perhaps the single greatest collection of rare character pieces in any set. Included is the ever grotesque Jabba the Hut who is no longer mono colored, an upgraded Bib Fortuna with flesh toned skin, a Gamorrean guard who has also been rid of his previous monotone color, Han Solo and his loyal aid Chewbacca, Jabba&#39;s dancer/slave Twi&#39;lek, and Leia disguised as Boussh the bounty hunter. Last but not least is the cackling cretin who perpetually sits by Jabba&#39;s side. The only other character who I would have to loved to see included is the musically inclined Jabba lackey, Max Rebo, who resembles a small blue elephant. Everyone of these mini figures are absolutely worth owning, and fortunately (or not so fortunately, as I&#39;ll elaborate on later), they have all been included in one complete set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Palace is at once an immediate upgrade from the original 2003 rendition. This is most noticeable from the exterior. Unlike the old version, there actually is a front to the set that gives an exterior view of the palace. It is excellently designed and resembles a MOC creation somewhat. The front entrance leads directly into Jabba&#39;s &quot;throne&quot; room via an arched entrance that connects the two buildings. The gate can be raised by pulling upward on a vertical plank it connects to. The watch tower lies atop the entrance and contains space for a crate, glass bottle, and lookout station presumably for the Gamorrean. The main room is quite entertaining to build. Within its confines are Jabba&#39;s throne platform, the trapdoor, Han frozen in carbonate, two pedestals with food and drink, a crate, as well as some sort of jar with food or who knows what in it. Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;room can be accessed for play by removing the roof of the building or swinging aside the front portion of the room. The trapdoor isn&#39;t the typical two-piece hinge mold that drops down when you remove a peg, but one that is designed specifically for the set. By pulling on a long plank, the smooth tiled floor moves to the side allowing a figure to fall through. At first I was skeptical of the trapdoor because there wasn&#39;t anywhere for the mini figure to fall, but the revelation of the Rancor Pit set clarifies this problem. Another significant upgrade to the original set is Jabba&#39;s platform, which now slides forward over the pit as it does in the film. The older model dropped the trap door when Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;platform moves back in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now to the bad news. The part that I alluded to in the beginning of the review. This is the most overpriced set I&#39;ve ever bought. The only justification I can see for the exorbitant cost that should be ninety dollars max are the intricately detailed character molds. However, I am only speculating, while vainly trying to find some way to ease the pain of buying a set that I knew I would love at a price I knew I would hate.&nbsp;</p>

Does not have (too many) goofy play features, but has some good ones (trap door, carbonite, door). The figures are nice (though I preferred the old versions).

"CapnRex101","2012-06-16T17:16:23.42Z","9516 - Jabba's Palace","<p>This set is based on one of the most famous scenes from the entire Star Wars saga and is an ideal&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of the legendary lair of Jabba the Hutt in my opinion. It is the set I was most excited for of all the summer sets and I am far from disappointed. In fact I am delighted with this wonderful model! The set is a huge step up from the previous incarnation of Jabba's Palace, set 4480, Jabba's Palace which was released in 2003. The model of the building is utterly fantastic, but the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;are even better than that! All ten of the Minifigures (I am considering Salacious B. Crumb, the Carbonite piece and the B'omarr Monk&nbsp;Minifigures) are superb, especially the excellent new Jabba the Hutt figure and the new Boushh which were both highly anticipated. I suggest you get comfortable as this review could be a long one...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very nice indeed, being a large set the model warrants a huge box, and it looks superb from all angles. The artwork on the cover shows the palace from the inside, on the left is Jabba's luxurious throne room, and one the right is the vast guard tower which looks out over the Dune Sea of Tatooine. The two components are disconnected and angled in towards one another which shows off all of the detail to best effect.</p><p>All but one of the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;is visible, Jabba himself is sitting on his gigantic dais with Bib Fortuna standing right behind him and Oola is dancing in front of Jabba for his entertainment. Salacious Crumb is sat on the edge of the throne room as Boushh approaches with Chewbacca in tow. The B'omarr Monk is walking around near the door to the palace and the Gamorrean Guard is standing high up at the top of the guard tower holding his axe and a pair of macrobinoculars to keep an eye on all of Jabba's many enemies. Han Solo in Carbonite is found to the left of Bib Fortuna but the Han Solo Minifigure cannot be seen as he is still encased in Carbonite.</p><p>The entire set is displayed on a Tatooine background similar to that on set 9496, Desert Skiff. There are some sandstone rocks and the vast expanse of the Dune Sea is visible behind the palace along with a blue sky with a few clouds and the unique twin suns of Tatooine. The whole design of the image looks excellent in my opinion. On the right side of the cover is the dark blue area of the box on which the Minifigures are all displayed and seven of them have the 'new' stamp next to them as they are brand new figures. The same blue border as usual runs along the top of the box with the lovely shot of Darth Maul in action towards the right end, and the Lego Star Wars logo on the left.</p><p>The back of the box displays the model from the outside of the palace on a similar background to the front. The set is labelled with the numerous features, each of which has a small image to demonstrate the function. These functions include the opening door to the palace, the swivelling turret above the door, the flick fire missile, Jabba the Hutt's sliding dais, the opening trapdoor and the removable roof as well as several others. Jabba's Palace is shown from various angles in a blueprint style as well which has been seen on almost every other set this year and I am a huge fan of these lovely images. There are also a few pictures of the Minifigures in various situations in the palace, for instance, Han having just been freed from the Carbonite by the disguised Leia with Bib Fortuna quietly observing them, ready to tell Jabba what he has seen.</p><p>The instructions are split into two booklets and they each have the same wonderful artwork as the box on them, I found no mistakes in them and had no pieces missing from my set. A comic is included at the back of the second manual showing Leia infiltrating the palace in her Boushh disguise and attempting to free the incarcerated Han Solo. This is a nice touch which could inspire some play for younger Star Wars fans. I really hope they continue this comic strip feature in future instruction manuals.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are vast numbers of superb parts included in this set such as the swathes of tan and dark tan which make up most of the palace and a huge number of dark grey plates of the rectangular, square and curved variety which make up the flooring in both the tower and the throne room. There are an incredible six brand new moulds in this set! Such a large number of brand new pieces in one set is almost unheard of, although all of them make up part of a Minifigure.</p><p>There are ten dark tan rounded corner pieces which make up the roofs of the throne room and the tower. Six of these are the smaller six by six versions, and the others are all ten by ten, both are incredibly useful for MOCs and in this colour they are all totally exclusive to this fantastic set! There are some nice arches in tan which creates the spectacular architecture of the palace both inside and out, these could be useful for your own models as well, especially Mos Eisley buildings perhaps. There are five of the fairly new column cylinders in tan, which are reasonably uncommon and could be useful as well. Some pearl gold pieces are included which are always welcome and there are two green frogs which act as Gorgs for Jabba to snack on. Two printed tiles are included, each of which comes with a spare so you actually get four, but I will discuss those further later in the review.</p><p>Best of all in my opinion are the twenty one dark tan slopes included which mostly form the curved outer wall of Jabba the Hutt's throne room. Although they have appeared in two sets prior to this one, they have never previously been seen in such vast quantities. They could be very desirable components and I am certain that they could be used very frequently. Overall this is an ideal parts pack, especially if you are making a desert or Tatooine related MOC.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; ""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:3.75pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

There are ten fantastic Minifigures, almost all of which are brand new! I will begin with the heroes of the set.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The least interesting Minifigure of the set in my opinion is <b>Chewbacca</b>, he has been seen plenty of times before but is nevertheless a great addition to this set. His sandwich board style head and torso piece is exactly the same as previous versions, it is cast in reddish brown and has a small amount of printing on it, his nose is printed in black and the bandoleer he has slung across his chest is printed in silver on both the front and back which is accurate to the film. His torso is plain reddish brown as are his arms and hands. His legs too are just plain brown with no printing at all. In this set Chewbacca comes with light grey handcuffs as he has been captured and is being ransomed to Jabba at this point in Return of the Jedi.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The next Minifigure is <b>Han Solo</b>. The figure is very nicely detailed indeed. He is quite similar to the Han Solo Minifigure from set 8097, Slave I, but on this occasion his head printing is totally different. The hair is just the standard male Minifigure hair in brown, it suits the figure despite its simplicity and I am very satisfied with this hairpiece overall. His head is printed on both sides and I think it is great. On one side he has a concerned expression with brown eyebrows and a chin dimple. The other side has the same eyebrows and dimple, but his eyes are closed as he is in a state of hibernation trapped inside the Carbonite and, following his release, he is left temporarily blind due to him having hibernation sickness which is demonstrated very well by this lovely expression.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">His mouth is slightly open on this face which looks excellent. His torso is printed with the creased shirt which Han was wearing when he was encased in Carbonite. It has a lot of detail including plenty of creases in the fabric of is shirt and a slightly open collar which leaves some flesh visible. There is sadly no back printing, but this is forgivable. Finally, his legs are plain reddish brown just like they are in the scene during Return of the Jedi.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The <b>Han Solo in Carbonite</b> piece is excellent, it is identical to the one in set 8097, Slave I, since I got this piece in that set it has become one of my favourite parts of all time due to the incredible detail and very realistic appearance. At either end of the piece there are handles which can be held by Minifigures so they can move the Carbonite around and the same patterns are printed on the block as are seen on the Han Solo Minifigure. I love the four tiny control panels on either side of the piece and there is a lot of black printing where the lumps and bumps in the Carbonite. Hans arms are in the same position as in the film, held above his head which looks amazing. My favourite feature of this piece however is the fact that the Han Solo Minifigure can be placed inside the Carbonite block where there are two bars for him to hold.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Next up is the highly anticipated <b>Boushh</b> Minifigure. For a long time I for one have been hoping to see a Boushh figure and finally we have one, and it does not disappoint! There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most detailed and accurate Minifigures in the history of Lego and is already a personal favourite of mine.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The helmet is a brand new mould and one of the most detailed pieces I have ever seen in any set. The cast is fantastic with all of the parts seen on the actual helmet in the film. It is mainly the nougat colour first seen in the Prince of Persia line which is perfect and has lots of brown printing as well. The small torch like appendage on the right of the helmet next to the visor is moulded in and printed in silver which is a nice detail as is the silver and black mouthpiece which is both moulded and printed onto the helmet. There are areas of dark grey on the sides and front of the helmet, as well as a black visor which is entirely accurate. The whole piece looks like it has come from an action figure, which some people may consider a problem, but I think is fantastic!</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The head is printed on both sides. It is of course Leia's head as she is disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh in this scene. It has previously been seen in set 7965, Millennium Falcon, set 7879, Hoth Echo Base for Leia and for Princess Tamina in the Prince of Persia theme. It is printed with black eyebrows, eyelashes and red lips on both sides. On one side she has a cheerful expression and on the other, an angry expression. She also comes with a dark brown hairpiece which is nice and has only appeared in this colour twice previously. She wears a nice backpack which is made of three pieces, a dark grey bracket which fits around the neck, a black one by one plate and some dark grey binoculars. It is quite accurate and I am very pleased that they included the backpack with the Minifigure of Boushh as without it the figure does not look quite right somehow.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The torso is printed with a huge amount of detail. It features some pearl dark grey armour, brown padding and a reddish brown shirt beneath the armour which has some creasing printed on it making the figure look slightly more realistic. Over the top of all this detail is a fantastic bandoleer which has various buckles and tiny patterns on it as well as what appears to be some ammunition at the top of the strap, it probably carries several more detonators like the one held by the Minifigure. The very top of Boushh's built is also printed on here; this belt is continued on the hips of the Minifigure. There is a lot of back printing with a continuation of the bandoleer, armour and brown padded area as well as an orange section at the bottom of the torso which is nice. The arms are tan and her hands are brown as she is wearing gloves.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The tan hips are printed with the rest of her belt and a bit of creased fabric, which is also on her legs. The dark orange padding printed on her knees is similar to that seen on her torso and she has a lot of folded fabric printed on here which is just like what Boushh wears in the film. She carries two accessories, a black force pike which is nice and a fantastic Thermal Detonator which is printed in a pearl grey one by one round tile. The red button used to detonate the device and a jagged black stripe is printed on the piece as well as some of the separate plates which are on the grenade in the film. As if things were not good enough already, we even get a spare Thermal Detonator to use!</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Now on to the neutral characters, the first of which is the <b>B'omarr Monk</b>. This figure has been seen once before in the previous Jabba's Palace set and is made up of twelve pieces, including a translucent crystal ball piece and four black swords which have been seen a lot in the Ninjago line. The Minifigure is quite accurate to the appearance of these mysterious inhabitants of the ancient former monastery which Jabba calls his home. It has four legs and the disembodied brain of the Monk in the jar held beneath the droid. The brain is in fact a simple one by one plate which is perfectly suitable for this Minifigure and looks great within the jar.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The most famous of Jabba's numerous dancers is the Twi'lek slave <b>Oola</b>. She meets an unfortunate end just prior to the arrival of Luke and the other Rebel heroes when she is dropped into the lair of the terrifying Rancor. The Lego Minifigure of her is excellent. This is only the second female Twi'lek we have seen in Lego form, the previous one being Aayla Secura from the Clone Wars so this is the second time we have seen the lovely Lekku piece. On this occasion it is cast in bright green which is superb. It is printed with a black headdress which is laden with silver studs and a large silver insignia on the top of it which is accurate to her appearance in the film. Her head is printed on both sides with two different expressions. One of them is a happy face with her eyelashes and lipstick similar to that of Leia, one the other side lipstick and eyelashes are printed as well, but she is screaming, presumably due to the arrival of the carnivorous Rancor.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Her torso is printed with her black net like outfit which she wears in Return of the Jedi and a silver collar and chain loop too. She also has a thin brown belt and traditional female curves printed on her torso. This outfit is also printed on the back of her torso as are the collar, belt, and a metallic ring which holds her dancing outfit together from the back. Her arms and hands are bright green like most of the rest of the Minifigure. Oola's hips are plain black and her legs have the rest of the net outfit she wears printed on them. The entire dress is very accurate to the film and is nicely detailed too, making this an excellent figure and a great character to have in Lego form at last.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Now on to the more dubious characters in the set, <b>Jabba the Hutt</b> and his villainous entourage. I will start with the cruel Jabba the Hutt himself. This is a unique figure made up almost entirely of brand new parts. It is a huge step up from the previous Jabba the Hutt figure which appeared in two sets, as this one, unlike the other, is printed all over. The Minifigure is split in to one large piece which forms his tail and the lower half of his main body, a blue Technic connector, and a combined head and arm piece. Each of the larger components are packed separately in plastic bags in the box as they are presumably made in China, although the quality of the two parts still seem very good to me.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The tail and lower body piece is cast in olive green and has lots of nice printing of wrinkles and folds in his ancient skin which looks amazing. It is a much more accurate mould than previously and Jabba looks suitably rotund now as his tail is thicker and his body has a much wider circumference. There are holes for twenty studs on the bottom of the piece and a single hole for the connector piece to attach his head and arm component.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">His head is much more detailed than the bottom half of the figure and is also cast in olive green. The arms are poseable but cannot be removed. He can hold pretty much anything, from a blaster to his very own Hookah pipe and his right arm is printed with Jabba's unique tattoo, which is fantastic, far more than I could have hoped for with this figure before I got it. Most of the front of his head is printed in tan, with more wrinkles and his corpulent chin prominent. That hefty chin and capacious mouth are both very accurate to the film as are his asymmetrical nostrils and squinting eyes, which are printed in orange and black with lots of detail. The tan printing is varied all across the figure, with uneven edges which make him look much more realistic and closer to the character of Jabba than I had expected prior to the release of this set.&nbsp;</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Next up is the wonderful&nbsp;<b>Bib Fortuna</b>, Jabba's majordomo who handles many of his affairs inside the palace. This character has been seen once before in set 4475, Jabba's Message but this one is a slight improvement over the older one. The Lekku headpiece is similar to the older one but has a few updates, firstly, both of his Lekku, on both the front and back, are thinner. Also the huge raised area on the back of his head has been enlarged so it is more accurate to the actual Bib Fortuna character. The five lumps on his head are also present which, although it looks a bit odd, is great. The entire&nbsp;</font><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"">component</font><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">&nbsp;is cast in a hard plastic and is flesh coloured, it slides nicely over his head and cape.<o:p></o:p></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Bib Fortuna's head is also very nice with some good detailing on one side. His pointed teeth are printed on, as are his sunken yellow eyes which look suitably evil. There are a few little wrinkles around his mouth and the head piece is the same colour as the Lekku. He wears a simple&nbsp;</font><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"">black</font><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">&nbsp;cape just like he does in the movie over his dark blue clothing.</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2""><span style=""line-height: 12pt; "">His torso is printed with these clothes and there is some nice detail here as well. There are plenty of folds in the cloth, his pearl grey chest plate which has some bolts in it, and his dark blue belt which contrasts nicely with the armour plate. There is no back printing, but it would only be obscured by the cape anyway and his arms are dark blue. His hands are flesh coloured which is a strange choice as he wears black fingerless gloves in Return of the Jedi, so black may have been a more suitable colour for his hands. Finally, his legs are plain dark blue with no printing at all. I would have liked to see a bit of printing on his legs, but the&nbsp;</span>Minifigure<span style=""line-height: 12pt; "">&nbsp;is perfectly satisfactory without it.</span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2""><span style=""line-height: 12pt; "">Next up is&nbsp;</span><b>Salacious</b><span style=""line-height: 12pt; ""><b>&nbsp;B. Crumb</b>, Jabba's cackling court jester. This figure is cast in one piece, so perhaps should not be classed as a&nbsp;</span>Minifigure, but I am going to class him as one anyway! The piece is made of a slightly rubbery plastic and looks just like his movie appearance. There is some printing on his head of his eyes and beaked mouth, but apart from that he is dark nougat all over which is a good colour choice for him. He can sit on the edge of the dais or be held by Jabba the Hutt as he has a hole which can fit onto a stud beneath him. His curled tail can be unravelled and does not obstruct him sitting down at all. Nor do his legs as they are cast to allow him to sit comfortably without them getting in the way at all. I was very&nbsp;pleased&nbsp;to see this bizarre character be included in the set as Jabba's court really is not complete without him!</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">The last figure in the set is the brand new&nbsp;<b>Gamorrean Guard</b>. This is an excellent Minifigure which is hugely updated from the previous version. Just like the older edition, the figure uses a combined head and torso sandwich board style piece which is made of a hard plastic (which I was not expecting at all).&nbsp;</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">This one is cast in brown and printed unlike the other one. The cast is more accurate as well with much more texture. His head is printed in olive green mostly but he has some dark grey armour on the top and sides of his head, his teeth, his eyes, his white horns and his pig like snout, which is all printed on with lots of detail. The front and back of the torso section is mostly brown but on there is some very dark brown strapping and on the front is a nice metallic silver buckle. Beneath the straps is some kind of motif on his chest which looks great and appears on the guards in the film.&nbsp;Towards&nbsp;the bottom of the torso area is some textured fur which is quite similar to what we see on&nbsp;Chewbacca&nbsp;and looks quite realistic. Finally for this piece, his shoulder armour is printed in dark grey. All in all a very nice component indeed!</font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 3.75pt 0cm; ""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif"" size=""2"">His torso is brown with no printing as it is completely covered by the sandwich board piece and both his arms and hands are olive green. His hips and legs too are olive green, but his hips are printed brown on the front and at the top of the legs there is some printing of the rest of the fur which was started on his chest and a dark tan piece of fabric. Both look suitably torn and weathered for this character. He carries the signature vibro-axe wielded by all Gamorrean Guards which is made up of a brown bar of standard length and a dark grey axe head.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build takes about two hours and is quite an enjoyable build. Although not many construction techniques of interest are used, most of the build uses traditional bricks and there is very little Technic involved. The way in which the difficult curved outer surface of the throne room has been formed is quite nice as is the large domed roof which looks superb when completed. No SNOT or other techniques really feature in the construction, but it is a fun and traditional build nevertheless and one which would be ideal for younger Lego fans as it is quite easy to put together.
</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; ""></p><p style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; ""></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">When the model is all finished, it looks exquisite. Both the guard tower and the throne room are just about perfect for display and there are a huge number of excellent features to keep younger buyers interested.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">I will begin with the guard tower. At the base of the tower is the door to the palace which is seen at the beginning of Return of the Jedi when R2-D2 and C-3PO gain access to the palace via this main door.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The door is split into several panels just like in the film, and from the central one, the gate watcher droid can peer out at anybody who comes to the door. The eye stalk is retractable into the door or can be extended and moved around a bit from the inside. The actual eye piece is a wonderful printed golden round tile which looks extremely accurate to the droid from the film and you even get a spare one! The walls all over this guard tower section are made up of mostly tan pieces with a bit of dark tan interspersed with it which gives it a worn look which is quite realistic. The door can be slid upwards to allow access to the palace and there is a mechanism which allows the door to be held open if you wish. Above the door is a rotating turret to protect the entrance from Jabba's many enemies which is seen briefly in the film so is a nice touch on the part of Lego. Inside on the ground floor there is just an empty room with two orange lights on the wall and some windows.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">On the next floor is a balcony area which is mostly filled by the door mechanism, but a Minifigure can be stood up there if need be. Three small domes surround this veranda which is in keeping with the architectural design of the rest of the palace. On the inside of the building on this floor there is a wooden crate which holds a large rifle and a translucent bottle piece. Very simple but a neat little room nonetheless.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The top level is the lookout post and I love the shape of this. From the outside an outward curving shape has been created with four windows for the guards to look out over the Dune Sea. On the inside there is easily space for two Minifigures to look out. On the walls a pair of macrobinoculars and a standard blaster are held on clips in case the lookout spots any possible intruders. The roof uses two curved slopes and a small dome piece which looks great and matches the roof of the throne room nicely.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Now I will move on to the much larger of the two sections, Jabba's huge throne room. The floor area of this room is about six times the size of the tower which is plenty big enough to fit a lot of lovely details into this area. From the outside the difficult curving wall has been created from lots of dark tan slopes very well indeed, or as good as you are going to get without making it from a single large piece which would have been very boring indeed. Around the top of this wall are the tiny windows seen on the actual palace which allow some atmospheric lighting into the throne room.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The domed roof section can be removed easily and looks very good, most of the large dark tan curved slopes are used here and there is inexplicably a flick fire missile hidden beneath the upper section of the dome. This is launched by pushing a button on the other side of the dome. I have no idea why this was included, but for younger children it might be a fun feature, and it does not take anything away from the palace aesthetically.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Inside the room itself there are loads of features. It is possible to clip the sections together and walk straight from one area to the other through a large archway to the right of the throne room as you look at it from the inside. There are a few more lights on the wall here like there are in the tower and just by this doorway is Jabba's combined Hookah and Gorg bowl which he has next to his dais in the movie.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">In the bottom section a frog piece (which is acting as a Gorg, one of Jabba's favourite snacks, in this set) can be seen through a translucent bell jar style component. This is attached to the upper section, which is Jabba's Hookah, using two gold pieces which were first introduced in the Ninjago theme and are actually very useful indeed. A black lever is attached here underneath a white dome piece, which is the crime lord's Hookah. From the Hookah itself a string piece is used which Jabba can hold as his Hookah pipe. I was astonished that Lego included this as Jabba is using it to smoke something, possibly a narcotic, in this scene during the film and I would have thought that Lego would not want to place a smoking related instrument in a Lego set, even if it is just a fantasy model. I am glad that they did though as it is very accurate!</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Two tables are found in front of Jabba's dais, which each have goblets and an ice cream piece on them. Between the tables there is an open grille piece so that you can see down into the Rancor pit beneath Jabba's throne room. A brown box is one the left of the room which is empty. Central to the entire building though is Jabba's dais from which he plans his nefarious criminal schemes. There are four round plates used on the front of it like we see in the film and there is a place for Jabba and one of his slaves to sit. There is room for Salacious Crumb to sit here and for Bib Fortuna to stand behind Jabba whispering advice to him.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Jabba the Hutt's dais can be moved back and forth to cover the sliding trapdoor which allows Jabba to drop anyone who displeases him, such as the unfortunate Oola, down into the den of the Rancor. A tab on the left side of the model can be pulled to open up the trapdoor which is completely open and will drop whatever is on the flap right through the floor, so if you have the parts to do so you could add a Rancor pit down under the palace!</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Two small flights of stairs lead up to the dais on either side of it and behind Jabba is a small cooking area. There is another tab here which can be pushed forwards to move the dais forwards, although moving it backwards must be done by hand. When the dais is pushed forwards over the trapdoor it reveals a dip in the floor in which two gold round tiles, a Gorg, and a small blaster pistol are found. The back section of the throne room can be hinged open for easier access to play with it.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Last of all, to the left of Jabba is an alcove in which the frozen Han Solo is kept. On the wall next to him is a control panel which Leia will use to release him and the Carbonite is mounted on a turntable so it can be flipped around as though Han has been freed. The look of the throne room from the film has been captured perfectly and I love it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p></p><p>If you have made it this far, very well done as this has been an extremely long review! I am absolutely delighted with this set overall. It is a model of real quality and you can tell that a lot of time and effort has been taken over&nbsp;designing&nbsp;this vast set. There are numerous fantastic features and the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;are incredible. This model can be used with set 9496, Desert Skiff, and the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;from that wonderful set can be added to here if you wish which really adds to the playability. From a play perspective, this set is hard to beat with so many functions, but for display this set is also amazing, there is loads of detail and it looks good from the inside or the outside!</p><p>There is just one problem which many people have been concerned about, the price. Yes, the cost is high, the price per piece ratio is way off, but I honestly believe it is just about worth it! There are a lot of large parts in this set and a plethora of&nbsp;brand&nbsp;new moulds which will drive up the price, so when that is taken into account, I think the price, while still high, is far from extortionate.</p><p>This is a set which I highly recommend and if you have the money, do not hesitate to buy it. For fans of the Original Trilogy this set is really a must have and I do advise you to get it if you can. If you see it on sale, snap it up as soon as possible as it really is an absolutely delightful set which contains excellent&nbsp;Minifigures, fantastic pieces, and a superb representation of the legendary Jabba's Palace.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Nesquik","2012-11-22T10:07:03.137Z","Jabba up to his usual tricks...","<p>Oh Lego, it really has become a love-hate relationship. The company has had its fair share of flawed Star Wars products, but Jabba's Palace was, in many ways, something that I expected for quite some time. It merely proves that for all the wonderful values of the toy, the business heads are willing to squeeze every penny they can out of poor parents and adults who, realistically, have better things to spend their hard earned money on.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you're entitled to discounts or lounge around in Starbucks, Jabba's Palace won't make it to the shopping list.</p><p>But let's first discuss just how wonderful this product is, because it would appear that The Lego Group have really hit a cornerstone with this release. The choice of detail in this palace is remarkable, and helps to recreate the dingy atmosphere within Jabba's home.&nbsp;</p><p>The 'lounge' area (if you can call it that) can actually be removed from the 'watch tower', as the two are separate models that may be connected via Technics pins. This means you can choose to either place the watch tower at a more convenient location, or keep it close to the lounge for tighter playability.&nbsp;</p><p>One aspect of the tower that's interesting is that Jabba's front door can be found on it, along with the one-eyed creature that greets C-3PO and R2-D2. In the original version of the movie, the door was not much bigger than what is seen in this set, yet in the latest Special Edition, the door is suddenly akin to an aircraft hanger. It's good to see the designers were faithful to the original design.</p><p>In the upper levels of the tower, the Gamorian Guard can watch over the vast desert and possibly defend the palace if need be. This is the least interesting aspect of the product since we don't witness it in the movie, but I'm guessing it's based on original production artwork.</p><p>The area that steals the show is of course this 'lounge' area, which boasts many interesting features. Jabba's deck can be pushed forwards and backwards via a lever on the other side of the wall, and this is designed to work with another discreet lever that opens and closes the trap door. So, it's nice and easy to place a victim in front of Jabba, and if he doesn't look them, down they go to pay the Rancor a visit. *Burp*</p><p>Han Solo in carbonite can be found on the opposite wall, although the actual fixture is very wobbly indeed. The Han Solo minifigure can be placed within the carbonite casing.</p><p>Other nice details include some food and drink utilities, a tasty frog (shall we call him Freddo?) and a fireplace/oven behind Jabba's deck. Can't quite see the need for the latter, but it may have just been a way to add more playability to the product.</p><p>I think the images speak themselves for the 9 minifigures, so I won't prattle on about them. All that needs to be said is that the quality of printing is outstanding, and the new moulds for the Gamorian Guard and Bib Fortuna are wonderful. I also love the way that Jabba's head can rotate, and not only this, but the diaphragm is concealed as a 'ripple' in his skin. &nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of which, this brings me to the first caveat of the product... Why on earth did The Lego Group decide to sell the Rancor Pit (and thus, more minifigures) in a separate product? R2-D2, C-3PO, Luke and the Rancor were all important characters in the prevailing scenes, and yet they are absent. It would have made far more sense to have included the Rancor Pit in this product, thereby allowing the user to re-enact each scene accurately. Selling it separately merely proves that The Lego Group are aware fans will need to shell out more money just to attain a simple feature.</p><p>And now of course we come to the price. Wow... this is completely outrageous. In fact it's not even outrageous, but borderline disgusting.&nbsp;Let's make some comparisons.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hoth Echo Base retails for ninety-two pounds, including 773 pieces and 8 minifigures. That product itself is already somewhat overpriced (taking into account 'Star Wars Tax'), so I'm at pains to understand how this company can sell a product that has over 60 pieces less and just one more minifigure for twenty-eight pounds more.&nbsp;</p><p>That's shocking, and isn't justified one bit. Yes, the product includes some large components (Don't City products too?) and it does include a large Jabba figure, but that does not equate to a 30% price hike. At eighty or eighty-five pounds, Jabba's Palace would be fairly priced for a Lego Star Wars product, but just think what else you could spend with a hundred and twenty pounds. Modular Pet Shop?</p><p>This isn't the first and it most certainly won't be the last Lego Star Wars product to be flawed. It goes to show that for all the care put into the design of the product (mostly), this company feels it can take advantage of customers who are already feeling the pinch, and it's not on at all. If 2013 has this kind of pricing and quality of product, I imagine many fans will be left feeling frustrated and short changed.</p>

"Huge_Nerd","2012-12-14T13:57:50.207Z","There will be no bargain, young Jedi.","First off, let's get the price out of the way. Yes, it's expensive. &nbsp;But like the scene it depicts where Leia/Boushh threatens Jabba to pay more on the bounty for Chewbacca, you just have to laugh like Jabba, say ""Lego is my kind of scum, fearless and inventive"" and pay a high price--it's just too good to pass up. &nbsp;When I saw this set, I had to have it!<div><br></div><div>First the minfigures. &nbsp;Jabba is amazing and way better than the past version. His colors are nice and his tattoo is a great touch. Bib Fortuna is a highlight for me, as I always liked his character. &nbsp;He looks sinister standing beside Jabba as his&nbsp;adviser. The Gamorrean Guard is perfect and excellently detailed. &nbsp;Boushh/Leia is amazingly detailed and her helmet is especially a great piece. I love the detail on her thermal detonator piece as well. Oola is a fun figure to have, even if you can see her mouth from her alternate face peeping out the back. &nbsp;Salacious Crumb and looks convincingly nasty. &nbsp;The B'Omarr monk is a creative build, using Ninja swords and the distorting clear piece makes the one stud look like a brain. &nbsp;Han Solo is pretty much the same as that from the most recent Slave I, but the ""blind"" face really makes it look like he came right out of the carbonite. &nbsp;Chewbacca is pretty plain, but nice to have.</div><div><br></div><div>The model itself is outstanding. &nbsp;From the backside, it is a greater representation of the palace as seen from the outside. &nbsp;My favorite feature is the gate. &nbsp;If you have C3PO and R2D2 from another set, you can re-enact the scene where they knock and the door and talk to the gate-droid, and then the door ominously opens.</div><div><br></div><div>The interior is a nice representation of Jabba's throne room. The top comes off and the back opens to better get inside. &nbsp;Jabba's hookah with the frog snack is a great touch, as is the display of Han in carbonite with the accurately detailed control panel. &nbsp;The little stove and secret compartment with guns and gold is also nice. The sliding throne and trapdoor are a lot of fun, even without the Rancor pit below (yet!). The tower, with its weapons, bionculars, and bottle add to the playability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So in conclusion, Lego may have borrowed a page out of Jabba's playbook by extorting us with the cost, but I'm glad I paid the bounty!</div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-01T15:27:36.72Z","Jabba has Redecorated","<p><strong>Set #9516 Jabba's Palace: </strong>This set looks so much better than the original Jabba's Palace I can't believe it took them so long to get it right. Originally Jabba's Palace was a very limited build, originally released during the yellow skin era of LEGO Star Wars. (I think it was 2003.) It took a long time to see a better interpretation of the palace, this one features more structure and less open space.</p>
<p>It also really looks like the palace seen in the movie and the Mini-Figures are updated quite nicely. The only real issue I have with this set is the price, it does seem to cost a bit more than what you get. Still some of the contents help outweigh the value with the price-per-piece ratio. Anyway let's get on with this review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>This box is huge, I believe it is slightly larger than the Republic Cruiser (the last really big Star Wars set I've purchased) and the design really grabs your attention. You want this set, every feature and Mini-Figure shown on the front and back excites you far more than the original palace ever could.</p>
<p>There are two instructions for this set which are protected by cardboard, awesome LEGO. A set this large you naturally have numbered bags and each step builds one section of the palace, these instructions work pretty good as simple to follow and straightforward. I do think they might be a bit large for their own good, mostly because it's hard to find space for all your pieces and the manual on a table while you're working... Depending on the size of the table at least. Still great looking box and instructions this time around. Unfortunately they don't cross-promote the other sets from this wave and there's no Mini-Figure checklist for all the 2012 sets... No posters in this set either showing them all off.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I'm sorry folks there are so many parts in this set that I'm not sure where to start. All I can say about the pieces in this set is that you're going to see a lot, at over 700 pieces this is a set with a lot of potential for MOC lovers who enjoy good useful parts in sets. My all time favorite piece is the new sculpted Han-In-Carbonite piece, as someone who owns the original Jabba's Prize set with the first attempt at Han-In-Carbonite this update with actual sculpting and space to clip the Han Mini-Figure into it... Just such a great improvement.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The box advertises nine Mini-Figures (the Carbonite piece doesn't exactly count) and of those nine 7 are brand new for this set. We'll start with the not-an-actual Mini-Figure Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>B'omarr Monk: A buildable droid body for the B'omarr's brain in a jar, this honestly is a bit weak. I'm not too sure if it's the same type of build we saw back in 2003, it's possible they've updated it slightly, still it's passable as a B'omarr Monk. My one real issue with it is the leg assemply, using Mini-Figure swords for legs works, however it makes the poseability lacking. Considering in the Star Wars LEGO Games you can ride these things making the build slightly larger with more poseable legs would have been a fun little nod to the games.</p>
<p>Salacious B.&nbsp;Crumb: This is an unposeable sculpted creature, much like the original Sebulba from 1999. The sculpt work and the details on him are a vast improvement for this guy... Um, I believe this is brand new though we haven't seen Crumb in any past sets. Unless he was in the original Sail Barge or Palace sets, nope, he's brand new so he's a welcome addition to the Star Wars RotJ Characters.</p>
<p>Chewbacca: He's not new to this set actually he hasn't changed much over the years they've added a bit of paint since the first Chewbaccas, they haven't however added painted eyes to his piece yet though. Still he's a good addition to the set.</p>
<p>Bib Fortuna: This Mini-Figure is brand new for this set. We haven't seen the character since the original Jabba's&nbsp;Sailbarge set. The update to the print work on his face is a welcome addition. His sculpted Twi-Lek head piece looks fantastic, although it doesn't like to fit very well with his black cape. He only has single-sided torso printing sadly, still one can't complain too much as his costume was fairly forgettable and not super detailed if memory serves.</p>
<p>Gamorrean Guard: LEGO has really improved the look of this character since the old days, I have Jabba's Prize which featured a Gamorrean Guard. The updated print, sculpt and paint detail work on this Mini-Figure just screams awesome. He's also got printing on his legs for his furry shorts, the original was lacking in any printed detail. He get's a buildable vibroaxe to wield. One of my faves from this set.</p>
<p>Han Solo: He has a frumpy looking shirt print and a double-sided face, one with eyes closed the other with a&nbsp;slightly worried expression as he realises he's still at the mercy of Jabba. He doesn't have any accessories like a blaster or anything, but he does include a Han-in-Carbonite sculpted piece that he clips into, which I suppose is like an accessory. This Han looks great, and it's nice that if you buy this set, the Desert Skiff, 2013's Rancor Pit and Jabba's Sailbarge you won't have too many repeat characters from the scene of the films. I think the only ones missing are 3PO and a couple more Weequay and stuff.</p>
<p>Boushh: We all know who this really is, it certainly isn't the Bounty Hunter with a dangerous reputation. This Mini-Figure has a double-sided torso print, a great sculpted helmet piece, some nice accessories and leg printing. There's also a double-sided facial print, happy and angry expressions, and a spare hair piece to reveal the true person beneath the helmet.</p>
<p>Oola the Dancing Girl: I love this Mini-Figure. I mean the detail, the print work and the fact that this is my first Twi-Lek Female head piece... Yeah she's just great. She has a double-sided torso, leg printing and a double-sided head, happy expression and terrified. Honeslty the only thing to make this figure perfect would be the inclusion of a neck bracket and slave collar since she is a slave of Jabba. The head piece is pretty nicely detailed also, I believe it's the same one we've seen on Aayla Secura, still it works and looks great.</p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt: This 'Mini-Figure' is awesome. He's been given more printed detail work compared to the older Jabbas and is a giant slimy looking bag of putrid vileness. It's amazing how a different paint job can improve upon the same basic pieces we've seen before... I'm pretty sure the parts are the same, it's the printwork and the details that are 'new' and they work great.</p>
<p>A huge selection of Mini-Figures and an awesome group with only one or two weak members.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I love the build in this set, I have never built anything more satisfying than Jabba's Palace as far as buildings and structures are concerned. I mean I own City Park Cafe and the Silver Mine Shootout, but there's just something truly fun and exciting as building an iconic building from my childhood. This is how I always wished Jabba's Palace would be built, I mean compared to what we got in 2003 this new build just is far more satisfying and accurate to the screen representation.</p>
<p>There are 7 numbered bags in this set and each bag builds a certain section of the palace, bag 1 is Jabba, Boushh, Chewie, the monk and the front entrance to the palace. Bag 2 is the upper section/tower for the entranceway, the door and the Gamorrean. Bag 3 includes Han, Bib, Oola and the first half of the main audience chamber, bag 4 gives us the Rancor Pit's trapdoor and the upper floor of the audience chamber so your Mini-Figures have somewhere to stand. Bag 5 starts the walls with the archways and Jabba's food holder with Hookah Pipe attachment, bag 6 involves the rear wall of the audience chamber and the throne itself and bag 7 is the roof.</p>
<p>Each section of the build is really satisfying as it takes shape, there are a few instances of missing stability as you're building, so I don't recommend building this set without having a table or other hard surface nearby to work on. Still just an awesome build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This is what fans wanted when Jabba's Palace was first announced in 2003 I'd wager at any rate. And after we saw the first design attempt we all knew it would take a while before we truly got the 'Palace' portion of Jabba's Palace. This model just looks great, and it is loaded with details and features for some playability.</p>
<p>The front door can slide open and close, the clever geared mechanism that works to hold the door open is a fun feature, the moveable blasters and pop out eye-stalk built into the doors are really fun and don't get in the way like other features can.</p>
<p>The best part of this model is that LEGO designed it to connect with the new Rancor Pit from 2013. (Can't wait to nab that so I can see how it works.) As it is the sliding open trap door doesn't have anywhere to go at the moment, but just knowing that it will work as an interesting play feature when you have both sets together... It just adds to the score of this set. It's also nice because you can slide Jabba's throne forward to cover the trap door and that adds a bit to the play features. The only questionable inclusion for play features is the flick-fire missile in Jabba's roof. There's a Technic bar and pin that you can push to fire a missile, it's just really wierd having this be included as older fans might not appreciate this function. At least it doesn't intrude blatantly like some flick-missiles do.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall... How can you not love this set? This is the best interpretation of Jabba's Palace LEGO has made so far, and if we ever see it again after certain controversies that cropped up because of the overall design of the palace... Well I'm just glad LEGO made this available and I was able to get it as the set I believe has retired by now.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend trying to track this baby down, it combines with the Rancor Pit which means you'll have over 1000 pieces once you have both sets together and it is an iconic building from Return of the Jedi with many iconic characters and moments re-enacted in LEGO form. I do wish they'd updated the B'omarr at the same time as most everybody else, this is in fact the same build from the original Palace which... Just looks dated next to the new and improved Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>There are no stickers in the set either, so that's a huge plus. Oh right and before I forget the roof doesn't lock in, making it easy to get access to the inside from above for playing. Yep, this is a great and welcome update for Jabba's Palace's design, get it if you can. I wouldn't wait to see if it goes on sale if you still have some in your area though, while the price is a bit high (175$ in Canada if memory serves, which includes taxes) it is definitely worth the price. Especially for Original Trilogy fans.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Chills","2012-12-29T17:42:23.23Z","A palace suitable for one of the galaxy's biggest crime lords. ","<p>When the 2012 sets were announced this set caught my eye as a definite must-have. I felt like a kid again on Christmas when I opened one of the presents from my wife and found this large set under the wrapping paper. I have to say that it was well worth the wait. This is a really fantastic set. I had a lot of fun building it and it looks great on display. LEGO parted the pieces out in 7 different bags; in my opinion that's a bit overkill, 3 or 4 would have been fine. There are also two booklets that are in a separate bag against a piece of cardboard to keep them from getting bent. This set also comes with a brick separator, which I've seen in other higher-priced sets.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The first thing that grabs you is the detail of this set. Starting with the tower: three stories, the first one having a raising door, just like in ROTJ, and the eye-ball door droid is on there. The second story holds a weapons room and the top is a look-out spot for the guards. LEGO even designed a cool stopping mechanism for the door so that it will stay open.</li><li>Pro 2: The throne room continues with lots of details. First, there is the trap door to feed minifigures to the Rancor (I can't wait to get that set). There's also the required grate in the floor to watch the victims and the monster. Jabba's throne dais also slides forward so he can watch with the others. The lever that pushes it forward cleverly comes out of the fireplace in the back, which also has a small fire and pot on it. Under the dais is a secret compartment that holds an extra frog, gold coins, and a blaster pistol. In front is Jabba is a well detailed hooka &nbsp;with another frog in the bowl. The rest of the room has arches all over the place and a small amount of greebles on the walls.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 3: The build was a lot of fun. There are quite a few bags, but it makes it easier to sort out the pieces before building. I also really dig the colors used. There are lots of light and dark sandy pieces, some brownish red pieces, and a smattering of burnt orange pieces. All great colors to recreate the a monastery in the desert (for those that are scratching their heads, the B'Omarr monks originally owned the building and Jabba took it over, but still allowed them to live there). The tower attaches to the throne room with technic pins, making it removable. And the back wall of the room pivots open, allowing access to the back. Oh, and the roof is removable; all great features adding playability.</li><li>Pro 4: The minifigures are fantastic! This set is pricey for the number of pieces, but I think it's because of all the highly detailed minifigures included. Han has two faces, one a grimace and the other a smirk. Oola, also has two, one for dancing and the other for falling into the Rancor pit. Boushh/Leia also has two, a smile and a frown; LEGO also included hair for her when her helmet is off. Bib Fortuna looks angry, Salicious Crumb looks mischievous, and the B'Omarr monk looks pretty relaxed. The Gammorrean Guard is fierce and highly detailed, as is Jabba. Both are much better than the previous versions. Rounding out the figures is Chewabacca, a must-have for this set, but not particularly unique.</li><li>Pro 5: No stickers! I don't mind the occasional sticker sheet, but I was pretty happy to see that all the detailed pieces were printed, so no stickers to apply.</li><li>Pro 6: I really like this version of Han in carbonite. I have Slave I 6209 and this version is much better.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Looking over this set it is pretty close to perfect; however, I do have one complaint. The holder for Han's carbonite block looks incomplete. It is just a plate with a clip on a turntable. I think LEGO should have put the block on a wall and had a mechanism that allows it to drop like in ROTJ.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is really a fantastic set! I know the price is a bit high for the piece count, but I feel the minifigures and the detail of the set make up for it. I highly recommend this set to anyone collecting SW Legos. It is a fun build, has cool pieces, and even the flick-fire missile isn't too cheesy. I've got this set displayed with the Sail Barge and my other Tatooine sets. Now I have to find the Rancor Pit on sale!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3

"wii1232","2013-08-16T16:14:10.99Z","New Version, Better Details!","<p>I got this set last Christmas, and it had the second most pieces to Republic Frigate, which is another one I got on that same day.</p><p>Anyway, now to the set.&nbsp; The minifigures are cool, although it could have also come with Luke , Boba and Lando, since they weren't just on the Desert Skiff in the movie.&nbsp; They were also at Jabba's Palace.&nbsp; But, if you own the Desert Skiff, then you can have Luke , Boba and Lando in both sets.&nbsp; Same with Princess Leia in her SLAVE outfit(since he is in her Boushh outfit in the set) and Max Rebo from Jabba's Sail Barge.&nbsp; They also could have put one more Gamorrean Guard, and then R2-D2 and C-3PO.&nbsp; they could also put some minifigs of the members of the Max Rebo band in both Jabba's Sail Barge AND Jabba's Palace.</p><p>My favorite character would probably be Salacious B. Crumb, since they're he's minifig.&nbsp; Because Jabba, Gamorrean Guard, Bib, Han, Han in Carbonite, and Chewbacca have been made into Lego form before, just in different variants.&nbsp; Even though Oola and Princess Leia in her Boushh disguise are new as well, I like Salacious the best because he is an unusual minifig to be all one piece.&nbsp; The only other minifigs that were one piece were Sebulba from 7171 Mos Espa Podrace from 1999, and Aldar Beedo from 7186 Watto's Junkyard from 2001.&nbsp; So that means, he is the first minifigure to be released as one piece in a set in a decade and a fifth(1/5).&nbsp; That's 12 years!</p><p>This set has LOTS of functions!&nbsp; This is probably a set that has the most functions and details since 10123 Cloud City from 2003!</p><p>I mean, an opening and closing gate, a gatewatcher droid, weapons storage, sliding throne, trap door, gorg bowl, 9 minifigs, a spinning security camera at the entrance, spinning Han in Carbonite, tables, a flick-fire missile, and an opening backside of the throne room part, that's exactly 12 features!&nbsp; You can even take the hole roof off!&nbsp; Make that 13!&nbsp; And I think Cloud City only had about, 9 or 10.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Brickinator","2022-01-24T10:54:03.993Z","9516 Jabba's Palace","<p>So to start off, this was my favourite lego set as a child.</p>

<p>It was my first big Star Wars set, and I remember it being lots of fun.</p>

<p>With that being said, It still holds up.</p>

<p>While it is kinda dated in the build techniques, it doesn&#39;t look that bad.</p>

<p>But the best part of this set is obviously&nbsp;the mini figure selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chewbacca, The bomar munk, and Han Solo are already pretty nice figures to get, but the rest are spectacular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start at the man (or slug) him self: Jabba The Hutt.</p>

<p>He is in my opinion the best big fig ever made, He&#39;s so good in fact that he looks just like a regular model Jabba.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boussh is also a great figure, the first one of it&#39;s kind.</p>

<p>And the rest is also really good, but in won&#39;t go to in depth because they are al just amazing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The palace it self is also good, with a nice interior.</p>

<p>It&#39;s to this day still awesome that you can combine it with the 75005 Rancor pit.</p>

<p>The tower, while weak on the inside, features a great opening gate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, should you buy this?</p>

<p>Well, that depends on if you want to spend the increased price.</p>

<p>But i can only recommend it.</p>

"VitaminJS","2023-03-12T20:48:55.11Z","My childhood dream","<p>Hi, I want to tell you why this isn&#39;t only the best set&nbsp;for me because I got nice memories with it and why it also could be your favourite.</p>

<p>Film accuracy: The minifigs and the build are very accurate to the film. Only the entrance door is not accurate.</p>

<p>Minifigs: Just awesome! If you like the first 40 minutes in &quot;The Return Of The Jedi&quot; you are going to love them. 6 of them are unique and pretty good printed and moulded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a toy: You have the option to combine it with the Rancor pit, which makes it even better to play with. A lot of hidden features and details.</p>

<p>For collectors: No matter which trilogy you like, there is something for you in the set. The&nbsp; unique figures have to be part of every minifig collector&#39;s collection and the build is the most accurate Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;palace&nbsp;you can get.</p>

<p>Compared to similar sets: They are no similar sets. The only two other options are Jabba&#39;s sail barge and Boba Fett&#39;s throne room to get the figures you need for a good-looking Jabba&#39;s palace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only downside is the price... not only because it is old and you have to buy it from third party sellers, the rrp was&nbsp;also very high. With around 16cent per part, you definitely have to get&nbsp;some spare money for it.</p>
