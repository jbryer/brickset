This elegant and intimidating appearance is perfectly translated into Lego form and this model is truly wonderful with a vast number of features, excellent detailing and a fantastic visual appearance which is second to none. Not only is the model absolutely brilliant, but the Minifigures too are some of the best you are likely to see in any Lego set, especially the incredible Darth Malgus Minifigure, which is a triumph and has instantly become one of my favourite figures of all time. The model may not be huge, but it is totally solid and filled with parts wherever you look making the price perfectly reasonable in my opinion. There is honestly no part of this set that lets the rest of it down and I think this model is a real must have for any Lego Star Wars fan, whether or not The Old Republic game appeals to you.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is just as good as the set itself with an excellent design. The Interceptor is flying through the air with all of its wing flaps open and laser blasts are speeding past the left of the ship, some of the flick-fire missiles featured in the set have been launched and are on their way to annihilate their target. The background shows the devastated Coruscant cityscape following the Sacking of Coruscant at the climax of the Great Galactic War around which the game is based. We can see the city at night with many buildings lit up including the Jedi Temple which can be seen behind the ship.</p><p>None of the Minifigures actually appear in the artwork as nobody can be seen in the cockpit and everyone else is either sitting inside the Fury-Class Interceptor or still fighting on the ground. The Old Republic logo appears at the bottom left corner of the cover and is glowing in sparkling gold. The Minifigures are all shown in a gallery format on the right edge of the box in a dark blue section like the rest of the boxes from this year.&nbsp;the incredible Darth Malgus&nbsp;is at the top with his two equally awesome Sith Troopers standing below him, all three have the word 'new' emblazoned next to them. The same lovely dark blue border runs along the top of the box with Darth Maul in action on the left and the Lego Star Wars logo opposite that.</p><p>The back of the box is great as well&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;all of the features in small images and annotations showing the positions of the various functions on the model. The ship is also shown in a blueprint style from different angles and there are two pictures of the model fighting set 9497, Striker-Class Starfighter over the forests of Alderaan which is nice. There is also an image of Darth Malgus piloting the Interceptor which is suitably sinister.</p><p>The instructions share the same image of the ship as the front of the box and I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces. There are two booklets and at the end of the second one is a nice comic strip which shows the set in action and gives a bit of inspiration for how one might go about playing with the model and the possible scenarios which you could set up with it. I hope this is a continued fixture of instruction booklets in the future. Both of the instruction booklets and the small sticker sheet are packed in a plastic bag with cardboard backing to keep them flat and crisp in the box. I am not entirely sure if all sets have this extra packaging, but I am very pleased that they chose to include it as it keeps everything in perfect condition.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a huge number of excellent parts in this set. They include the wonderful chest plate worn my Darth Malgus and the lovely helmet adorning the head of each Sith Trooper. The cape worn my&nbsp;Malgus&nbsp;as well is an interesting and attractive design which I like. The model itself is rife with fantastic parts including one or two new ones. Four brand new four stud by four stud plates with clips attached are featured in the structure of the wings as are plenty of the small light bluish grey&nbsp;brackets&nbsp;first seen in the Marvel Super Heroes sets released earlier this year which could prove extremely useful for inclusion in MOCs. There are many two by four smooth tiles in black which have a lot of possible uses for your own models as well as lots of wedge plates in light and dark shades of grey. The partially translucent cockpit canopy component is lovely with plenty of detailing and very realistic panelled design which looks superb. Last but not least, numerous slopes and wedges are included to give the model flowing bodywork, but if you choose to break down the set these could be very useful for your own creations.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>When it comes to the Minifigures, this set just about surpasses any other. I will start with the wonderful Sith Troopers and leave Darth Malgus until a bit later on.</p><p>The <b>Sith Troopers</b> have a huge amount of detail and include an excellent new helmet which is very reminiscent in its shape of that of Darth Vader which is a lovely touch. They are both laden with detail. A dark red stripe runs from the front of the piece, over the top of the helmet and all of the way down the back. On this red stripe there is a white Sith Empire symbol which is quite similar to that of the Imperials from the Original Trilogy which is a theme running right through the Sith Empire of the Old Republic. The front of the helmet has silver highlights and some black striping, as well as various grilles, buttons and dials. It fits nicely over a standard Minifigure head.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of which, the head is printed with exactly the same&nbsp;design&nbsp;as Lex Luthor from the Super Heroes theme which is fine as it features a suitably grim expression for an evil foot soldier. The torso is predominantly black like the rest of the figure, but features a similar design to the chest of Darth Vader like the helmet. There is some chest armour printed here as well as several dials and a black belt with silver&nbsp;detailing. The back of the torso is also printed with a continuation of the dark grey armour and the belt, the arms are plain black as are his hands. His legs are plain black. What I find very interesting is if you look closely at the second frame of the comic in the second instruction manual, you can just about see that the Sith Trooper there does indeed have some leg printing, perhaps hinting that the legs were originally going to be printed, but this had to be removed for some reason. I would have liked to see some leg printing, but it is looks just fine as it is so I have no real complaints here. The two Sith Troopers included both carry a regular short blaster.</p><p><b>Darth Malgus</b> is absolutely incredible. He is utterly flawless and is already one of my favourite Lego Minifigures of all time, not only is the character fantastic in the game so to get a Lego version of him is great, but he has&nbsp;unbelievable&nbsp;amounts of detail and even a brand new mould to form his combined chest plate, shoulder armour and life support mask.</p><p>His head is wonderful with sunken yellow Sith eyes, a serious expression and a lot of scarring on the left side of his face which is seen in the game (in one of the cinematic trailers we see how he gets this scarring). This is printed in brown and the rest of his head is light grey which is accurate. He also features wrinkles and cheek lines on his face which show how withered he has become after numerous epic battles with various Republic Troopers and Jedi during the war. Darth Malgus does not wear his unique life support pack until he is crippled at the hands of Satele Shan and Jace Malcom, who both appear in set 9497, Striker-Class Starfighter so you can&nbsp;re-enact&nbsp;that scene, therefore I am very glad that the mask was not printed on his face so you can remove it if you wish. The armour piece is amazing, it is almost an exact copy of the appearance of the life support pack in the game with a highly detailed mould and even more detailed printing of dials, buttons, and lots of red display screens. It is cast in black and has dark grey and silver printing on both the front and back of the piece which is fantastic. This component fits around the neck of the Minifigure and the head can be slotted in over it nicely.&nbsp;</p><p>The cape is a brand new piece too I believe, although a fairly similar design came with the Bride from Series 7 of the&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures, although that one was a different material and was longer. It has only one hole to go around the neck and is not as wide as a normal cape which is completely accurate to his appearance in the game and allows the shoulder armour part to fit comfortably around his neck. The torso is also printed with lots of tiny details, even below the armour where the exact same designs are printed on the torso as on the separate armour piece! Below that there is more accurate grey and black segmented armour plating. This incredible detail is continued on the back of the torso, even though it is totally obscured by the cape. His arms are dark grey and his gloved hands are black. His hips and legs are both printed too, I think this is the most printing I have ever seen on the hips of a Minifigure, it continues with the patterning on the torso and looks great, as do the shin and knee plates printed on his dark grey legs with black and grey padding around his thighs. He carries a standard red lightsaber with a metallic silver hilt just like in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The more I look at this Minifigure the more I love it and I think you will too, if you cannot afford the entire set however, I would advise you to purchase this figure (as well as, to a lesser extent, the Sith Trooper) from Bricklink as it really is a must have in my opinion.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is great fun. It displays both Lego Technic and Lego System skills and they combine&nbsp;seamlessly. It took me about an hour and a half and was somewhat challenging in places, especially during the Technic sections of the construction process when making the wings.&nbsp;There are many interesting building techniques used, including the use of a&nbsp;rubberised&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;connector piece (which has been seen quite frequently previously) to hold the wings together at opposing angles, which is a feature of design I have never seen before. The manner in which the wings are&nbsp;strengthened&nbsp;is ingenious&nbsp;by sliding large beam pieces inside the main body of the ship so the wings to not wobble in the slightest. The angled wings have been cleverly created and the&nbsp;way&nbsp;in which the wings flaps are held open or closed is excellent using pistons and clips. There is also plenty of SNOT in this set which&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the bodywork smooth and sleek, which really adds to the&nbsp;visual&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of the model in my opinion.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the model is constructed, as soon as you pick it up you will notice the weight. The model may not be the biggest, but it is one of the most compact and you certainly get a fair volume of bricks for you money. There is no wasted space and the model is incredibly sturdy which makes it very swooshable and adds to the playability of the set. Not only does the swooshability of the ship allow the set to be endlessly played with, but so do the numerous features.</p><p>The first of these is the opening cockpit which opens in a similar way to the cockpit in set 9492, TIE Fighter and features a small boarding ramp as well. The printed control panel in the cockpit can be hinged out of the way for access to the pilot's seat and there are a few lights inside the cockpit to add extra detail inside. A Sith Trooper can easily fit in the cockpit, but Darth Malgus cannot sit comfortably unless his cape is removed. I doubt Darth Malgus would want to pilot the ship anyway, he would get one of his troops to do it for him I imagine! The rear compartment of the ship can be accessed via opening the back panel much like the cockpit and a small floor section can be slid out for ease of access to the area. Two Minifigures can be stood or sat in here and two weapons (either blasters or Darth Malgus' lightsaber) can also be held by clips in this section of the model.&nbsp;along&nbsp;the top of the main body of the ship there is a bit of greebling and some red lights.</p><p>There is also plenty of detail on the wings which are very reminiscent of TIE Fighter wings much like the cockpit. The four stickers included are found between the wing panels on either side, they are not particularly easy to apply, but with a bit of patience they can be lined up perfectly and they add some more depth to the look of the model from the side. There are two flick fire missiles on each wing which can be launched a reasonable distance and are a fun feature for younger Star Wars fans, but look fine if you wish to display the set as when they are loaded, they look like laser cannons. The main feature of the set however are probably the four opening flaps which can be extended while the ship is in flight and retracted for landing. However you position these flaps they do not slide open or closed and are held solidly in place. The unique shape of the ship has been perfectly created in Lego form and it looks brilliant.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a set I cannot recommend highly enough, not only are the Minifigures fantastic, but the Fury-Class Interceptor itself is also a delightful model which looks amazing on display and has plenty of playability as well,&nbsp;making&nbsp;it ideal for pretty much any age! The price is&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;reasonable I think and if you cannot afford the whole set, try and get the Minifigures as they are all absolutely incredible as I keep repeating. There are four stickers included to add some detail between the wings but they are easily applied if you take care so I am not going to count that against the set at all. Therefore I can find absolutely no issues with this model so I am inevitably going to&nbsp;award&nbsp;this spectacular set with full marks and my highest recommendation to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SamBoRG","2012-06-11T19:58:58.31Z","Very nice set with excellent minifigs","<p>Not much I can say that hasn't already been said above. This is a set that I've been wanting from the minute I first saw previews of it. I don't play The Old Republic, but know that this ship is from the game and has been accurately transferred into Lego form. I picked up my set from Toys R Us on the weekend for 25% off. I believe the normal price is about AU $140, which makes it more expensive than the other non-capital ships, but not too expensive.<br></p><p>The build of the ship is quite interesting. It has 2 compartments. 1 is the cockpit, the other is for the 2 troops (or cargo if you take the troops out).</p><p>The cockpit has a fold-out control console so you can easily insert or remove the pilot. The rear compartment has a slide-out tray where the 2 troopers can sit; it even has a place to hold their rifles. Storing Darth Malgus's lightsabre is a bit tricky though and I opted to just leave it out.</p><p>The wing design is quite clever, using a combination of standard plates, technic rods and pins. It's an effective way to get those weird angles correct on the wings. The wings are the most repetitive part of the entire build, and even then they are not that bad.</p><p>The ship is considerably bigger than I expected. I figured it would be about the same sort of size as the latest rendition of the X-Wing, only a bit chunkier. I was wrong. This ship is much bigger. At first I thought it was a little bit more fragile than others, however it passed the ""swoosh"" test in the hands of my 3 year old son (if you know of a better test of the strength of a Lego build, I'm all ears!). Although my son is probably a bit more careful with Lego than other kids his age, I still feel that if a set doesn't fall apart in his hands after 10 minutes or so then it's a sturdy build. In this case though, the ship is probably too big for a small child to swoosh around much.</p><p>The use of stickers is a subject of much debate among Lego collectors. Some feel they reflect a poor design of a set (a well designed set shouldn't need them right?). Some feel the stickers add something that can't be achieved with just Lego pieces. Others feel that maybe they should be printed on the piece instead of requiring a sticker (which could peel off over time or be placed on crookedly). I'm not really sure where I stand on this. In this build there are only 4 stickers (all the same) and they only stick onto 4 of the 1x8 tiles in between the upper and lower wings. It's a minimal effect, but in my opinion effective and nicely done. I don't intend to pull this set apart so there will be no issue with the stickers for me.</p><p>The minifigs are awesome. Darth Malgus looks very dark and menacing. His chest piece and pauldrons look incredible. The 2 Sith Troopers are also quite nice, and I hope to see them in more sets, although this is unlikely. It would have been nice if their faces were something new though (they are just the same as the clone/storm troopers), but this isn't a big deal. It would have been good to have a new rifle design as well, but again, no big deal.</p><p>Playability wise, the ship is quite bulky, but easy enough to swoosh around. The flick missiles on the wings look good, but the wings do flex a little when you try to fire them. The ship doesn't have any sort of landing gear (like other TIE craft). It would have been nice to have had some transparent bricks to place under it to prop it up when it's on a shelf because as it is it looks a bit weird when on display.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigs (especially Darth Malgus) are awesome.<br></li><li>Nice big build with some interesting design features, especially in the wings.<br></li><li>Sturdy and swooshable.</li><li>Very playable with the compartments being highly accessible.<br></li><li>Accurate representation of the ship from the game.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No landing gear or transparent blocks to prop it up when on the shelf<br></li><li>Flick missiles more for appearance than function<br></li><li>Sith Trooper minifigs could have been a bit more detailed<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I'm very happy with this set. I think it's one of the better sets in this latest batch of Star Wars sets. It's a bit pricey compared to the X-Wing, Y-Wing and even Darth Maul's ship, but worth it. With the addition of a MOC stand or some transparent blocks this will look very nice on a shelf.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,4
"PluffTed","2012-07-14T16:12:55.623Z","Top 5 Lego Star Wars Ship EVER","<p>Just got this set from Amazon and man, I can't describe how awesome it is.&nbsp; This ship is from The Old Republic (TOR) era and I'm not really a fan of expanded universe, but this set has exceeded my high expectations.&nbsp; The minifigs are incredible.&nbsp; Darth Malgus is a very nice looking fig, but be warned, he is not really for play, but more of a display fig.&nbsp; His vertical arm movement is very limited by his respirator/shoulder armor, so can't really fight with him.&nbsp; The Sith Troopers are very nice too, but I was kinda expecting printed legs and a jetpack as displayed in TOR.&nbsp; Malgus is the pilot and the Sith Troopers can be held in the back of the ship.&nbsp; Both hatches where the minifigs are held are double-hinged and very detailed.&nbsp; So, the body was a fun build, but the wings are a pretty lengthy build.&nbsp; The wings have very complicated, technic-piece-filled interiors that allow their angling and allow the back part of the wings to fold up during flight (very awesome piston-like pieces suspend the back parts of the&nbsp;wings during&nbsp;flight).&nbsp; The wings also feature flick-launchers (SHOCKER), which I have yet to flick.&nbsp; The playability is in question due to how heavy it is, but it's easy to securely grab on to it (AND SWOOSH IT!).&nbsp; It was $90, which is kinda steep, as I would have priced it at $80, but still worth getting (NOTE: DO NOT BUY AT TOYS R US!&nbsp; IT'S $110!).&nbsp; The parts are pretty cool and recently designed, and the building experience is kinda fun (except for the wings).</p><p>I DEFINITELY recommend buying this, as it is in my Top 5 Lego Star Wars Ships EVER.&nbsp; I would give&nbsp;this set&nbsp;a <strong>9.5 out of 10 overall</strong>.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"scottyj","2012-09-28T18:22:16.193Z","Great set, good build, fab minifigures!!","<p>Hi, this is my first review and I have just finished the build of the Fury Class Interceptor and what a fab build it was.  Overall I am quite pleased with the set from the minis' to the instruc tions.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>From what I gather all of the new larger sets come with the instructions with a cardboard backing to prevent bending and creasing in the box, which is a nice touch.&nbsp; The instructions come in two&nbsp;parts which again something&nbsp;I am noticing with all new Star Wars sets (as i have pretty much every set since it began in 1999), which gives a more detailed build.&nbsp; The box has some great art work showing all of the playability factors which come with the set.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some very nice parts which aren't found in many other Star Wars sets.&nbsp; As it is an imperial set then be prepared for lots on light grey, dark grey and black which is seen in most of the recent imperial sets (2012 Tie Fighter), but there are some nice pieces which you don't often come across.&nbsp; There is quite a repetition of parts from the wings (a common bug bear from symetrical sets) but there is still a good variety of parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minfigures are excellent!&nbsp; It is as simple as that.&nbsp; The two Sith Troopers have a great depth of detail on the front and rear printed torso.&nbsp; Some printing on the legs may have been nice but you can live without it.&nbsp; The Darth Malgus figure is absolutley great,&nbsp;I cant fault anything about him.&nbsp; The torso and legs are well printed but then there is the added depth of the shoulder pad piece which slightly covers his face but has a great effect on the Sith Lord.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The cockpit build in nice and uses some nice techniciques which give a little variety to your standard TIE build.&nbsp; The wings are very nicley constructed but can be a little samey after you have completed the left hand wing.&nbsp; The set has a very solid build quality about it and feels like you have pressed a 100 2x4 bricks together when giving it the swoosh test.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is&nbsp;a great set and&nbsp;I love the fact that all of the minifigures has a seat onboard the ship.&nbsp; It does feel sometimes that Lego includes alot a tenuious minifigures just to make the price point but this set more than makes up for the slightly high price tag.&nbsp; I can't say anyone who gets this set would not enjoy it in on wasy or another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Chills","2012-12-04T10:44:43.547Z","The fierce interceptor of the Sith!","<p>I haven't played SWTOR, but I'm a fan of the books. I'll admit the main reason I wanted this set was for Darth Malgus, but the set itself is really quite cool. It seems like LEGO has been refining its building techniques over the 
years, and this year their ships don't have the flimsy feel of years 
past. One particular technique I liked was how you attach the side 
pieces to the center piece. They slide in and lock down with technic pins. And LEGO included a brick separator with this set. Something they seem to be doing with the larger sets. LEGO also put the instructions in a plastic bag with cardboard. I really like this because so often the books would get bent and sometimes torn.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The ship is nice and solid. The Interceptor is swooshable and doesn't fall apart in your hands. The different sections are held on well, and the moveable pieces also stay put.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The designers did well with detail; the ship looks just like it does in source material. The black and grey color scheme reminds one of the TIEs, and the use of greebles is well done; enough to give the ship a mechanical look but not too many.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The build was fun, and not repetitive. The side sections (I'm trying not to call them wings) consist of 4 hull plate sections and then connector sections. These are all pretty similar for each side, but one doesn't feel like one is building the exact same thing over and over. LEGO also split the pieces up into 6 bags, which I think is a bit much, but it makes separating the pieces easier.</li><li>Pro 4: The minifigures are fantastic, so highly detailed! Darth Malgus has a new style of cape, not as wide as the previous ones. His chest, legs, and armor is full of detail. Same with the Sith Troopers; detailed helmets, chest and legs. They even have angry faces.</li><li>Pro 5: There's good playability with this set. The wings fold open and closed, and the bottom ones have a locking mechanism so they don't open on their own. The cockpit has a moving control panel, and there's a landing sled for the troopers that slides out of the rear of the ship.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I'd like a little bit more detail in the cockpit and on the landing sled.<br></li><li>Con 2: Landing gear would have been nice. The ship sits too low, it would be nice to have it propped up. (guess I'll have to MOC a stand).<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a really a great set. It has all the features needed for a fun build and plenty of detail. The use of technic pieces inside make the ships solid and swooshable. The minifigures are awesome additions to any collection. The lack of landing gear is the biggest con for this set, but that doesn't really take away from this set's cool-factor. I was able to nab this set MISB from ebay for well under RRP, so keep your eyes out for a good deal. You won't be sorry.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4

I am very satisfied with the design and true-to-life look that LEGO has given this ship, despite being unfamiliar with the Old Republic or its storyline. The minifigures themselves are excellent, and can easily see why people are charging such high prices for them (on eBay you can expect to pay around £50-60 just for the 3&nbsp;figures). </p><h4>The Interceptor</h4><p>The Sith Fury-Class Interceptor itself is an amazing model, very sturdy with a high amount of detail, especially towards the&nbsp;back of the ship. The wings are also stable and detailed, not the sort that could be flimsy or break (heralding back to the old TIE Fighters). The cargo/troop hold is another good feature for the ship, allowing you to store the Sith Troopers when it is on display. The wings are also a good, complex design, at a price like this it would be disappointing to see something simple, but thankfully they are a good build.&nbsp;It is overall a very sound model that isn't likely to fall apart in your hands and well built.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The minifigures</h4><p>I can easily see why many have rated Darth Malgus as one of the most anticipated figures, as LEGO have paid close attention to detail and made him as accurate to the real person as possible. The Sith Troopers also boast good detail, especially on the helmets, which are shaped similar to that of Darth Vader's helmet. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Highly detailed Darth Malgus</li><li>Well detailed Sith Troopers</li><li>Very sturdy build</li><li>Wings are well constructed</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>£80 is perhaps a bit too steep, can be found elsewhere cheaper.</li><li>Lack of space to put Malgus' lightsaber</li></ul>

"tkettle9719","2013-03-26T21:54:44.74Z","The Return of an Empire","<p>I got this set a few days ago as a birthday present from my parents, and was very happy to get it since I had almost no money to spend. After trying to get it for a year, the Fury-Class Interceptor is now in my room to display. After playing around with it for a day, it has proven to be an excellent set for both play and display; however, like all sets I review (except for the perfect Bag End set), I do have some minor quibbles with this set's representation. Let's get started:<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The ship is designed extremely well; instantly recognizable for those who play ""The Old Republic"" often, yet it calls back some future ships (Episode III Jedi Interceptors) and Imperial colors to be established as a true Star Wars ship. <br></li><li>The minifigures, as always, are amazing here; Darth Malgus in particular is extremely detailed and looks almost perfect, and the Sith Troopers look very close to their source material. <br></li><li>The model is also surprisingly sturdy; considering that the bulk of the pieces is used on the wings (which make up 536 pieces of the 741 needed to make the ship) and are only connected via cross axles and connector pegs (they really are, which surprised me at first). <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The stickers are a big issue to me because they aren't the clear decals, which many, myself included, find to be more sticky and longer-lasting than stickers which are totally colored. However, they do add a lot of detail, so sticker-haters beware...<br></li><li>The price is also of definite concern to me; although this is a larger model than I thought it would be, it is a tad pricey for what you get. Minifigures really drive up prices, especially with Star Wars. <br></li><li>My final irk is that TLG didn't care enough about the Sith Troopers in this set to put the nice new printed legs on them; although the new Battle Pack has them, this was released only six months earlier and included two of them. Why? That could have justified the price just a bit more...<br></li></ul>
<p>Regardless of the small and insignificant flaws, this is an excellent set. Most of these problems are fixable, so do get it on sale if you really want it. It's large, bulky, well-designed, and a lot of effort went into the making of this set.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box and Instructions were fine. &nbsp;My only complaint is that it the pieces came in 6 bags. &nbsp;I know that the bags make things easier as you build the ship, organizing by order, and making it as simple as possible. &nbsp;Thing is sometimes I don't want it all laid out for me already. &nbsp;I don't need 6 bags to build 4 wings and a cockpit. &nbsp;I'll get into that in the build section.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Parts are good. &nbsp;I love that most the set uses standard parts, but still looks as clean as it does. &nbsp;It hits the angles and shapes right without having to use any specialty pieces. &nbsp;The one piece I'm iffy on is the rubber lego. &nbsp;Just two of them. &nbsp;I see why they use it, it keeps the angles wings together. &nbsp;But a rubber lego? &nbsp;not what I'm used to seeing.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Fantastic&nbsp;Mini-figures. &nbsp;Darth Malgus is very impressive. &nbsp;And the Sith Troopers are cool too. &nbsp;Only 3 figures which seems sparse, but on the other hand, the three fir perfectly in the ship. &nbsp;I wish there was a spot for their weapons though.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build wasn't too dificult. &nbsp;I enjoyed it for the most part, but I found it repetitive towards the end. &nbsp;4 wings piecces (8 if you seperate the front and rear sections) that are all basically the same. &nbsp;And as I mentioned before they bag them seperately. &nbsp;Unnecessary really. &nbsp;Just put them all in one bag and let me sift through the many pieces, that's part of the Lego experience. &nbsp;The cockpit was a very fun build, moreso than the wings. &nbsp;Quite intricit, especially when the after prodcut looks so simple. &nbsp;But That was a plus.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The ship looks great. &nbsp;Especially with the rear part of the wings extended. &nbsp;Looks sooo cool. &nbsp;I couldn't ask for more there. &nbsp;And it's so much fun to swoosh around and fight my newly acquired X-wing. &nbsp;One thing I don't like about the completed are the flick missles. &nbsp;They don't really flick. &nbsp;And they fall apart quite easy. &nbsp;In fact the wings seem a bit flimsy at times. &nbsp;The rear part of the wings have fallen apart a few times on me. &nbsp;I wish they were constructed as solidly as the center section.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Originally I wasn't sure if I would like this set. &nbsp;I don't play Old Republic, so I'm not familiar with the ship. &nbsp;But the final product looks great. &nbsp;I am very pleased with the Sith Fury Class Interceptor.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4

When they began developing the vessel, the team had already decided on a geometric style of smooth surfaces and a large number of angles for the Imperial ships. The ship design is sleek like a marriage between a TIE interceptor and the Millennium Falcon combine.&nbsp; In the fiction, the ship is manufacturer by Sith Empire and arm with 4 precision laser cannons and missiles. The function of this ship is to intercept during assault mission and personal transportation.<br><br>Box/Instructions: Let's take a look at the inside of this box.&nbsp; The box is only&nbsp; 80% fill, leaving 20% empty.&nbsp; We get 6 numbered bags pieces and a color construction manual.<br><br>Minifigures: It comes with two black Sith Troopers. These troopers look fantastic and complement very well with our next figure we are getting and that is…. Darth Malgus.&nbsp; Lego also included a few weapons for your minifigures which is nice to have and all three figs has one face printing. Aesthetically, these three minifigures are a huge draws for me!<br><br>Sith Interceptor:&nbsp; The hammer that will shatter the rib cage of the Republic fantastic.&nbsp; It took around 6 hours to complete this set depends on age and skill set. The Interceptor has a very solid build quality to it.&nbsp; The colour combination of grey, black, and small amount of red really accent the over all visual appearance of this ship. Overall, the build of this ship wasn’t difficult at all but some might find it repetitive because of the two large wings.<br><br>The cockpit is articulate to fit Darth Malgus comfortably by fold-out the control console and can easily insert or remove the pilot. On the back of the ship, there is a cargo landing sled for carrying the Sith troopers.<br><br>Now my favourite part of this ship is… the wings! The wing design is quite clever by using a combination of general plates, technic rods, and pins to hold and fold the entire rear setup. It reminds me of the Xwing’s strike foils opens up during combat in the Original Trilogy.&nbsp; Lego also added a few flick missiles on the wings to give it some play value.<br><br>Overall this really is a fantastic set: I personally never play the Old Republic game and I still want this set because of my love for Star Wars ships.&nbsp; After obtaining it, this set certainly doesn’t disappoint. I’m not a Lego aficionado but the great thing about building block toy is that you can remove things you don’t like and add things you like into it.&nbsp; As for the price, during summer 2012 most retailers sold this set for $90 (USD) and TRU had it for $110 (USD). Again that was the pricing plan back then. Now you can pickup this set for only $71 (USD) at Amazon with free shipping!&nbsp; At this price, you should definitely pull the trigger if you are still deciding.&nbsp; As an adult collector, The Sith Fury Class Interceptor received a 9.5 and received my personal Triple-E rating of ""Extraordinary Engineer of Excellence!""<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Fauch","2015-07-17T17:18:24.683Z","Great display","<p>It&#39;s my first star wars set since 2000</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of grey and black, lots of plates, various technic bits. I like the 4 Corner Plates 45 Deg. 8X8, the 4 wings 6x12, the printed canopy and the 1x2 trans-red flat tiles with grille.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Bought the set without them, yeah I know, I&#39;m crazy. More seriously, Darth Malgus himself increases the price by at least 20&euro;, which is a bit much for a single figure, though the overall price is actually still decent, if you live in the US.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A nice and complex build, especially the wings, with interesting advanced technics used. Technically, you are almost doing 4 times the same build, but that&#39;s fine as it gives you more time to get familiar with the technics used.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a sturdy and large ship (about 25 x 25cm). It looks very cool. You can grab it in the center and swoosh it around, though it&#39;s probably too heavy for young children.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you consider the high price, it is pretty poor playability wise, the rear wings can open and close, you can fire flick missiles and that&#39;s all. Not even an enemy to fight.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s hard to rate, if you plan to display it, it&#39;s worth a 5. For children to play with it, I would give a 3, it offers really little playability compared to many other sets of this price. 100&euro; was quite overpriced RRP for this set. Prices on the secondary market seems more decent.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T15:35:44.677Z","A Legend Among the Legends Sets","<p>The Sith Fury Interceptor is a unique build with one of the best figures Lego has ever made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures include Darth Malgus and two Sith Troopers. The Sith Troopers lack disappointing leg printing, although they would release with it the next wave in a battle pack so it isn&#39;t a huge deal. The Malgus figure is great with a unique cape and molded respirator (perhaps the best mold lego has ever done). The figures complement the build perfectly with all three having spaces in the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ship itself is a sold and bulky build with a cockpit and a troop compartment in the rear. Unlike its in-universe counterpart, this iteration is a starfighter rather than a massive shuttle transport as seen in the games. It fills this role well and is a really neat build. The &quot;wings&quot; are put together with some interesting techniques and the S-foils function as intended. There is nothing to complain about build-wise.</p>

<p>The set was released for $90 back in the day which would be close to $110 in 2022. This was fairly overpriced however looking at the aftermarket value now it was well worth it. This is a great set, especially for anyone who wants something a bit more unique in their collection.&nbsp;</p>
