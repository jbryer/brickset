"deepheater","2012-05-27T04:20:55.267Z","A nice little kit, not enough detail for adults but great for kids.","This set is probably not meant for adult collectors as it appears simplified in some areas, kids should be quite happy with it though. There are three individually numbered bags, three loose plank pieces and the instruction book in the box. The parts are assembled in a logical order and shouldn't present any problems for young ones. I knocked mine over in about 20 minutes. The playability is ok, there is a fold out plank for Luke to walk on, a secret area storing 2 laser pistols, a side mounted flick missile and 4 figures. The box states that all 4 of the figures are new to this kit, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Kithaba and Lando Calrissian, so figure collectors will probably buy it for this reason alone. The individual Sarlacc is well done with opening jaws to capture any character that strays too close. The only problem is to display the kit the skiff needs to be mounted higher than the Sarlacc to look any good, lego has provided clear blocks to lift it up but it is not high enough. Overall a cool little kit to add to your collection, worth the money, maybe, depends how much you love LEGO Star Wars.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-05-28T09:52:44.12Z","Destination, the Sarlacc pit!","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">I saw this in a shop the other day and just couldn't resist.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><b>Luke Skywalker. </b>One of the
heroes of the galaxy, saving bricks and minifigures! This is surely
one of the nicer versions of Luke. He comes with his green
lightsaber. He has a very determined face. His torso is double printed Tatooine &amp; Jedi
garbs. He does not come with a black cloak or hood, which would have been nice.The legs are standard black legs.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><b>Kithuba.</b> I think this guy looks
cruel. Very fitting for someone employed by a gangster. He has a
small blaster to get the job done. His green head carries a&nbsp;gruesome looking face with
the teeth of his jaw clearly visible. He has a red cap. His torso is also&nbsp;double printed with a
shoulderstrap that runs across the front and the back, the legs are just your standard red legs.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><b>Lando Calrissian.</b>&nbsp;Here disguised as
one of the palace guards. He looks very similar to the 80's Kenner
action figure, but in a LEGO version. Comes with the combined
axe-spear.&nbsp;His head comes with that winning
smile and the signature moustache. The helmet included is just too
cool! It is so accurate it is a treat to own one.&nbsp;Lando is the last minifig to have double printing in this set, showing
the chestplate on the front and some straps on the back.&nbsp;The tancoloured legs I
believe, is standard... tan.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><b>Boba Fett.</b> He is slightly
altered from previous versions, as in a good way. You get to build
his blaster and it looks pretty cool. Made up by a black
lightsaber handle and a small blaster.&nbsp;First off, the helmet. His
helmet and jetpack are light green. It has that tattered paintjob
which makes it look absolutely wonderful. Underneath you have Fett's
scarred face, with a nice smirk. The torso is&nbsp;very detailed with lots
of Fett's signature but no backprinting. Both the legs and torso comes
in an accurate blue colour. A slightly torn cape in a darker green
hangs from his left shoulder and he wouldn't be complete without his
jetpack. Lastly, the legs are&nbsp;printed in a way that
complements the torso. Nice job LEGO!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<h4><br>Sarlacc pit</h4>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">So that's what the LEGO version of
Lucas' beak predator looks like. I'm a bit of an old school fan so I
am, needless to say, <i>not</i> a big fan of <i>someone</i> adding on
to a perfectly fine cinematic experience. But that discussion doesn't
belong here in its entirety. Ehm...moving on. I do
have to say that this is a good version of a LEGO Sarlacc. You get
the tentacles, which are movable as far as spinning them. The mouth
piece opens well and a minifigure can easily fit inside it while
closed. If you want you can fit multiple ones when the mouth is wide
open. Around the pit are teeth which all fall off very easy. If you have it up for display you won't have any problem with that.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<h4>The Skiff</h4><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Well, hello desert skiff! This was a
pleasant build. Quite easy and doesn't take too long. But it is a fun
build. The use of sand or tan colours along with the brown gives it
that Tatooine feel that I know you will love if you are a Star Wars
fan. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">The control area, or driver's station
in the back gives you a choice whether the driver should stand or sit
while driving. You can do it both ways but it looks better while
standing. Apart from the mandatory plank for Luke to stand on,
there is not a whole lot going on. Of course we get the one flick
fire missile. Another nice touch was a small compartment storage in
the middle of the skiff, like a long box you just open. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">You get 4 translucent pieces to give
the illusion that the skiff is actually in mid-air. I thought that
was just about right height for the skiff, but not movie accurate. The movable side pieces in
the back gives extra support and balance for the skiff too. No
dislike button for that, that's for sure!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<h4>The set</h4><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Complete, it looks great. The skiff is hovering near the Sarlacc pit. You get Luke where he should be,
Lando in the background fighting Kithuba and Boba Fett jet packing
over from the sail barge to restore order. The brown and tan colours
are very accurate and the skiff itself is the best up to date. It was
cool that they included the improved Sarlacc too, but perhaps at the
expense of giving us an additional figure. You get a few extra
blaster guns too, which I think is nice. If you have the parts to
spare, you can easily make more Boba Fett blasters.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Although, there<i>
are</i> problems. The skiff is way to narrow. On their way there in
the movie there are about 8-9 people on the skiff. Now, if you want
to recreate that, it's doable but it gets crammed real fast. Me and
my daughter tried that, complete with a Chewbacca and all. If this
was just a <i>couple</i> of studs wider there wouldn't be an issue
really. For its defence I have to say that it is very priceworthy,
sturdy and there are no pieces that will fall off easily. Except the
teeth of the Sarlacc.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">I suppose this is the scene right after
Luke is wielding his saber like a madman, so that is why not another
of Jabba's henchmen are in this set. I sort of miss the acutal guy
who positions Luke before he gives the sign to R2 to ready his
lightsaber. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Sarlacc is just fun, although it's
supposed to be scary. My daughter spent at least an hour playing (but
it wasn't a Sarlacc in her world just then) with that without getting
tired of it. +10 in playability.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br>
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">What I like about it is that you get
some of the best minifigs, all in one set. You are getting some guys
who will be very sought after in the future. Get the set now for
yourself. Buy an extra for future investment.</p>

"CapnRex101","2012-06-10T14:32:42.727Z","9496 - Desert Skiff","<p>
 The Desert Skiff is a model which has been seen twice before in Lego, the first of which was set 7104, Desert Skiff, and later in set 6210, Jabba's Sail Barge (which is coincidentally one of my favourite sets of all time). This Desert Skiff is a huge step up from both of those, not only if the model itself a vast improvement which is now far more accurate than ever before, but this is also its largest incarnation and it comes with four incredible Minifigures, as well as a lovely version of the Sarlacc!</p>
<p>
 I can find nothing I dislike about this set and it will look great on display thanks to the wonderful&nbsp;aesthetics, as well as being full of features which make the set a lot of fun to play with so it appeals to everyone. One of the most famous moments from any Star Wars film has finally been created as it deserves.</p>
<h4>
 Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>
 The box for this set has some lovely artwork which makes it very attractive on both front and back. The cover of the box is very glossy and looks fantastic with the Skiff floating over the sand dunes of Tatooine as Luke is forced out onto the extended plank just like in the original scene from the movie. The Sarlacc is below the vehicle in its pit with its jaws wide open waiting for any unfortunate victims to fall from the battle overhead. Kithaba and the disguised Lando Calrissian are standing on he deck of the Skiff while Luke ignites his lightsaber standing on the beam from which he is supposed to fall to his death.</p>
<p>
 The&nbsp;notorious&nbsp;Boba Fett is flying towards the Skiff with his jetpack and is preparing to kill Luke once and for all, unaware that this battle might not&nbsp;end&nbsp;well for him. In the background is a shot of the desolate Tatooine landscape with dunes and sandstone rocks all over. The twin suns of the planet are visible in the sky behind the Desert Skiff as are a few wispy clouds. In the bottom right corner of the image the sand gives way to a vast chasm in which the ferocious Sarlacc resides. The Lego version of this monster is displayed in this abyss with his cavernous mouth wide open and his flailing tentacles reaching for whatever morsels he can gather from the battle above.</p>
<p>
 Behind Boba is a clever effect to give the impression of movement and jets of smoke are coming from his jetpack's thrusters which propel him through the air. As usual there is a blue border on the right sight of the cover which frames the four Minifigures and shows them off nicely, all four are brand new and are therefore stamped as such with the word 'new' next to each of them.</p>
<p>
 Along the top of the box is a dark blue area on which there is an epic shot of Darth Maul with his lightsaber ignited behind him, this is a design which has been seen on all of the boxes for Lego Star Wars sets this year and I love it. The Lego Star Wars logo is found in the top left corner with the information about the set such as the set number and name just below that.</p>
<p>
 The back of the box displays the various features of the set in small images around a larger central shot of the model. There are also two pictures of the Skiff from various angles in a blueprint style which I like. There are two illustrations of the scene from the movie being recreated in Lego which has been a feature in many boxes this year and one I appreciate very much. Finally, the function which allows the Sarlacc to swallow Boba Fett is demonstrated, more prominently than the other features of the set just above the blueprint images.</p>
<p>
 The instructions for this set have exactly the same artwork as the box on the cover and I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces. What I found interesting is that this booklet is printed on much higher quality thick shiny paper than most other instruction manuals which really adds to the quality of the set as a whole.</p>
<p>
 There is a comic in the back of the book with four frames showing how Boba Fett&nbsp;ends&nbsp;up being knocked into the Pit of Carkoon to be eaten by the dreaded Sarlacc. It is not accurate to the movie, but still gives some inspiration for play and is a nice feature of these new instruction booklets which I hope are continued in the future.</p>
<h4>
 Parts</h4>
<p>
 There are plenty of great parts in this set including a lot of brown, tan and dark tan slopes as well as a lovely brown curved section forming the front of the Skiff which is a piece which has only been available in a few sets before, and never in brown until now. A large octagonal ten by ten plate is included as the base of the Sarlacc which has never before been seen in this dark tan colour. The two large opaque dark tan cockpit sections which make up the mouth of the Sarlacc are also very nice and the&nbsp;tentacle&nbsp;pieces are great too.</p>
<p>
 There are a lot of pieces which would be useful for making any desert related MOC in this set with plenty of the required colours and components of all shapes and sizes to be used. We get six translucent cylinder pieces which allow the craft to appear to be floating and there are several lovely components for the Minifigures as well. These include Lando Calrissian's newly printed skiff guard helmet and of course Boba Fett's fantastic helmet, cape and jetpack pieces which are all wonderful. Not only do we get all of those, but we also get four of the fairly new and incredibly useful short blaster pistols with scopes and a black lightsaber hilt which becomes part of Boba's unique blaster.</p>
<h4>
 Minifigures</h4>
<p>
 The four Minifigures&nbsp;included&nbsp;in this set are all absolutely excellent. I will start with the two Rebel characters<strong> Luke Skywalker </strong>and Lando Calrissian. Luke has an all new outfit in this set and I love it. Luke's hair is just the same as we have always seen with Luke in his Jedi robes (except when he is wearing his hood) and is the traditional male hair piece in tan which is fine, accurate to the movie and suited to the figure. Luke's head is not new either having appeared five times previously in set 8089, Hoth Wampa Cave, set 8092, Luke's Landspeeder, set 8129, AT-AT Walker, set 7965, Millennium Falcon and set 9493, X-Wing Starfighter.</p>
<p>
 It looks good with some eyebrows as well as a chin dimple. He has a slightly cheerful expression, which is odd considering that he is in a battle for his life. It would have been nice to see a double sided head here, but I like it as it is nevertheless. His torso is totally new with lots of detail. Luke is wearing a black shirt beneath dark grey Jedi robes in this set which is accurate to the film. The shirt and robes both have lots of printing on them of folds and creases in the cloth as well as a nice belt too. The design is continued on the back with more folds and layered fabric printed here. His arms are black and his hands are both flesh coloured, which is correct as Luke did not yet have his black glove at this point in Return of the Jedi. His legs are plain black as he is wearing black trousers which is exactly what he wears in the film. He carries a green lightsaber which features the new darker shade of green for the blade and a metallic silver hilt.</p>
<p>
 Next is<strong> Lando&nbsp;Calrissian&nbsp;</strong>in his Skiff Guard disguise. This is an almost all new Minifigure with heaps of detail starting with his fantastic helmet piece. The sculpt of the helmet is actually the same as the completely dark grey helmet which we saw in set 6210, Jabba's Sail Barge, and the mould is fantastically detailed with embossing and layers of armour plating. There are even little ridges on the top of the helmet! The piece is cast in metallic dark grey and is printed quite a lot with white detailing on the horns which protrude from the mouth guard on the helmet. There is also some dark tan printing for the straps on the mouth guard as well as a bit of dark orange and gold printing on the peak of his helmet. His face is new as well with eyebrows, his moustache and a grin which perfectly suits the character of Lando Calrissian.</p>
<p>
 The entire head is of course reddish brown to match the skin colour of the actor who played Lando in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Billy Dee Williams. It is really nice to see another black head piece&nbsp;created&nbsp;in Lego as they are rarely seen in Lego sets nowadays. His torso is equally good with a metallic chest plate just like in the film and a dark orange outfit behind that. He has a dark red belt around his waist and brown straps which hold his armour onto his chest. This printing is also on the back with more strapping, the rest of his belt and the back of his dark orange shirt which is printed with tiny stripes, adding a bit of extra detail on both front and back. His arms are black and his hands are brown as he is not wearing any gloves. Lando also wears tan trousers so his legs are plain tan with no printing which is perfectly reasonable as I would not expect Lego to add leg printing when it is not required. He carries exactly the same weapon as the one brandished by the Savage Opress Minifigure from the Clone Wars which is made by combining a metallic grey spear with a metallic grey axe head. What we are left with looks great and is a perfect weapon for any Skiff Guard.</p>
<p>
 Now on to the evil members of Jabba's entourage. <strong>Kithaba</strong> is a Skiff Guard who does appear, albeit fairly briefly, in Return of the Jedi and is quickly thrown from the Desert Skiff into the mouth of the Sarlacc. I am so pleased that Lego have chosen to provide us with one of these Skiff Guards and the Minifigure is fantastic, there is a lot of detail and he looks great. Firstly, he wears a dark red bandana which has only&nbsp;previously&nbsp;been seen on the Shahan Alama Minifigure from the Clone Wars set 8128, Cad Bane's Speeder and suits this figure nicely. His head is in the same olive green colour as Nute Gunray's from set 9494, Anakin's Jedi Interceptor, and is printed with lots of wrinkles and detail which demonstrate his Klatooinian species very effectively indeed.</p>
<p>
 He has sunken eyes and a tiny white set of teeth poking out of his mouth, which is set in a grimacing expression. His torso is also printed with lots of detail on the front and back. The front shows his dark tan waistcoat and large&nbsp;bandoleer which crosses his chest with various pockets on it. He also has a brown belt and beneath his waistcoat, he wears a simple tunic which is covered with creases. His hideous green skin is exposed around his neck and printed in a similar manner to his head with wrinkles. The back of the torso is printed as well with his waistcoat and the rest of the brown bandoleer he wears.&nbsp;His arms are tan and he has brown hands. His legs are plain red which is just like what he wears in the film and he carries a simple blaster pistol with a scope, I love this weapon and would like to see it more frequently in future.</p>
<p>
 A couple of years ago when the revised<strong> Boba Fett </strong>was released in set 8097, Slave I, it seemed impossible to improve on that incredible Minifigure, but Lego has done it, with brand new leg printing, a new cape, and an improved gun for this bounty hunter to use. His helmet is identical to its previous version, but it is so perfect, that it needed nothing done to it and I am glad it has remained unchanged. It is moulded in sand green and is incredibly detailed with every little marking on Boba Fett's helmet from the movies including the arrows above his visor and the yellow lines on the left side of the piece. The grille at the back of the helmet is moulded in and the area around the visor is printed in dark red which is perfect. His cheeks have some dark green printing on them and the visor is black. What really makes this component however is the silver battle damage where some of the paint appears to have been scratched off during Boba's dangerous excursions.</p>
<p>
 There are holes on either side of the helmet where rangefinders can be fitted or any other Clone Trooper accessory if you choose. There are four dark grey rangefinders included and four dark grey sun visors as well. His head is also lovely with lots of stubble and eyebrows, as well as a cruel smirk and a few scars. It is also exactly the same as the one included with the previous version of Boba Fett. Te jetpack is a nicely moulded piece and is sand green like his helmet. It has no printing and is the same as the one which came with this dangerous bounty hunter in the Slave I. His ragged cape is not the same as the older one, the shape is identical but on this occasion it is sand green unlike previously where it has been brown, I like both colours equally so it is nice to have both so you can pick which one you would rather he wears. Both his jetpack and cape fit around his neck and still allow him to wear his helmet properly. Boba's torso is also just the same as the one in the Slave I set and has lots of&nbsp;details&nbsp;including his dark green armour and light grey creased shirt, as well as the braided Wookiee scalp he wears over his left shoulder.</p>
<p>
 The silver battle damage where the metal has been exposed on his helmet is also found here on his torso along with the various symbols and markings on his armour. He also has a nice brown belt printed on here with pockets for his all of his equipment. The back of the torso is left unprinted but that is fine as it is covered by both his cape and his jetpack. The&nbsp;arms&nbsp;are sand blue and he wears dark grey gloves. Now we come on to the really new section of the Minifigure, the wonderful new legs. The hips are in fact dark green and printed all across the front with more of his brown belt. The legs have a huge amount of detail on them including more dark green panelling with silver battle damage and a large pocket on each thigh which has folds in the fabric and flaps over the top of the pockets.</p>
<p>
 He also has orange knee pads with more battle damage and printing on his feet of his metal capped boots which even have his foot spikes printed on them. The piece is extremely detailed and totally accurate to the movie. Where the legs are left unprinted they are sand blue like his arms. Finally we have the new gun which he carries, it is made up of two pieces, a short blaster pistol and a black&nbsp;lightsaber&nbsp;hilt to extend the barrel. It looks excellent for something which is not a new mould and is fairly accurate to the EE-3 Carbine Rifle used by Fett in the movies as well. This edition of Boba Fett has really surpassed the previous ones and it is among my favourite&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;of all time.</p>
<h4>
 The build</h4>
<p>
 The build is not very long, only about thirty minutes, but uses a few nice building techniques, including a clever way of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;curved armour plating on your own models and a very nice way of creating the&nbsp;unique&nbsp;angle of the two steering vanes towards the rear of the craft using bracket pieces. The Sarlacc's tentacles are cleverly attached and the mouth of the creature has been made very well using two cockpit pieces to give the curved effect of the beaked tongue in the film. The lovely control panel is nicely made as well and I love the use of black tap pieces as engine components near the driver's area of the craft, which adds a bit of extra detail to the Skiff.</p>
<h4>
 The completed model</h4>
<p>
 After the fairly brief construction phase we are left with two fantastic little models, of the Sarlacc and the Desert Skiff. The Sarlacc is excellent, I prefer it to the Sarlacc in set 6210, Jabba's Sail Barge due to the vastly improved mouth and the added tentacles which are very accurate to the film and allow the creature to grip Lando as he does in the movie. The mouth can be opened very wide and can easily fit two Minifigures inside while still allowing the mouth to be closed completely.</p>
<p>
 The only visible part of the huge monster is set within a mostly tan base section, which is risen up at the sides to begin the walls of the Pit of Carkoon and has a few white spikes around the edges of the mouth just like in Return of the Jedi where the spikes are meant to prevent victims from having any hope of escape once they have found themselves in the clutches of the Sarlacc.</p>
<p>
 The Desert Skiff is much larger than previous versions of this vehicle, almost one and a half times the length of the two older Skiffs and is much wider as well which allows you to stand more Minifigures on the deck of other characters who were there in the movie (some of which are available in set 9516, Jabba's Palace, also from this wave of sets). The vessel has some nice bodywork and detailing which makes it ideal for display and there are loads of features as well!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The functions of the model are the poseable steering vanes which have a wide range of movement, the single flick fire missile slung beneath the craft, the opening compartment, and best of all, the&nbsp;extendible&nbsp;plank which Luke can stand on. The compartment looks like a bench on the deck when closed, and stores two small blaster pistols but it could hold much more if you wish. The plank folds into the ship seamlessly and looks superb whether or not it is extended. It is mostly tiled but has two studs exposed near the end of the plank which allow Luke Skywalker to stand there in readiness for his execution.</p>
<p>
 The flick fire missile is fairly easy to access and can be launched a fair distance. All of these features work very well and make the set a lot of fun for younger fans as there is a lot of playability. The entire Skiff is supported by three pillars, each of which are constructed from two translucent cylinder pieces stacked one on top of the other which gives the illusion that the Desert Skiff is floating above the sands of Tatooine.</p>
<h4>
 Summary</h4>
<div>
 There are absolutely no issues I can find with this set, everything is utterly perfect, from the four exclusive and excellent Minifigures, to the lovely Sarlacc and wonderful Desert Skiff. As a whole, the set works very well for play or display with almost all of the components one might need to re enact the skirmish over the Great Pit of Carkoon from Return of the Jedi. The features are all great and you can very effectively throw Jabba's enemies (or his entourage) into the terrifying Sarlacc.</div><div><br></div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 The Minifigures alone are worth the relatively low price that you pay, especially the awesome&nbsp;Boba&nbsp;Fett. The Skiff is very sturdy indeed and therefore very swooshable which only contributes to the superb playability of the model. I would highly recommend this set to anybody who likes Star Wars and with no drawbacks to the set I am going to award set 9496, Desert Skiff...</div><div><br></div>

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGH!""","<p>Though it doesn't look like there's much to this set, it's surprisingly substantial.</p><p>This is the largest version of the Desert Skiff yet, and it feels a lot bulkier when you've built in than you imagined it would. The skiff itself is very sturdy, with a couple of good features (along with the obligatory pointless flick fire missile - and this one is for left-handers only), and should allow for a good amount of play for younger fans. The plank folds out, and there's a weapons crate in the middle of the deck, plus the rudders are nicely rotatable and, er, tilt-able. There are a good selection of pieces too, particularly four new 1x2 plates with 1x2 studs on the side, unusually going upwards from the plate. They combine especially nicely on the fins, either side of a standard brick and meeting up perfectly with the classic 1x2-plate-with-a-1x4-set-of-studs-on-the-side-going-downwards piece.</p><p>The Sarlacc is great fun, with threatening teeth, alive-looking tentacles, and the special edition added beak that can swallow Boba whole! And the way the base is constructed fits with the other sets in the theme, with the base plate, level of grey bricks, and then the model itself. This allows the Sarlacc to look like it's sunken into the sand, which is a nice touch.</p><p><br></p><p>The real highlight, as with the other 2012 and 2013 Jabba sets, is the figures. I'm slightly dubious about Jedi Luke having a dark grey upper body, but it's not as bad as the pictures make out, and it is movie accurate despite everyone's initial reaction! There is a minor gripe where his chest is showing on his torso: it's a lot darker than his head. Kithaba is fantastic, with a good upper body and a brilliantly painted face. Lando in his skiff guard disguise also looks great, his helmet is the stand out feature, and his two piece axe is very nice too.</p><p>But the real pi<em style=""font-style: normal; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; "">è</em>ce de&nbsp;r<span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; "">é</span>sistcance&nbsp;was always going to be Boba Fett. His torso print and helmet print are subtly different to the 8097 version, though there's nothing all that&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;about the changes. His cape is a very different colour and suits the desert setting. But it's his printed legs that are the selling point, they look excellent. And he's been given a much better blaster, made from a shorter gun and a black lightsabre handle!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A very sturdy and play-with-able set</li><li>Fun Sarlacc</li><li>Fantastic figures with great printing</li><li>In contrast to Jabba's Palace, very good value!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Nothing much, it does everything it claims to do very well!</li></ul>
<p>This is a great little set,&nbsp;reminiscent&nbsp;of Luke's Landspeeder which gave you more of a model than you expected, and a good selection of figures. It's a very good addition to the year's collection, filling the gap between the battle packs and the higher priced items well. It's just a pity that the second half of the year's higher priced item is £40 too expensive! (Yes, I have a chip on my shoulder over the price of the palace!

"jeroenaa95","2012-06-09T15:11:16.99Z","Very cool set!","<p>I got this set today (9th of June). I have built it immediately. I think this is a very nice set. I don't have the old desert skiff, but I guess this one is larger. It comes with a desert skiff, 4 minifigs and a sarlacc mouth with two tentacles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luke Skywalker:</p>
<p>He has a new torso. It is gray in sted of black. He, offcourse, has a green lightsaber. He has common black legs with no printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boba Fett:</p>
<p>He has an old torso, but his legs are printed. He has a new cape. He also has a new gun,&nbsp;a small blaster-pistol with a black lightsaber&nbsp;on the barrel.&nbsp;He has a battle scarred face and helmet.&nbsp;On the torso there&nbsp;is battle-damage too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kithaba:</p>
<p>I havn't seen this minifigure before, so he is new. I don't know what kind of spieces it is, but it looks a bit like a gamorrean guard, but without the horns. He has a green face. You can see his teeth. He has a dark-red thing on his head. He has a small blaster-pistol. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lando Calrissian:</p>
<p>He has a new torso design. He has a vibro-axe. He also has a new designed helmet. It is the same as the older one, but in other colors. He has a happy face. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The desert skiff:</p>
<p>It is larger than I had expected. On the skiff there is a kind of table-thing with 2 blaster-pistols. It has a moving ramp. It also has a place where you can steer the skiff. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarlacc:</p>
<p>You only get its mouth and two tentacles. He is in a hole in the ground with horns on the sides. You can put Boba Fett in its mouth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>It is a very nice set with 4 new designed minifigures. I recommend it. It is a set rated 10.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Huge_Nerd","2012-10-04T07:25:13.74Z","Skip this set and it will be the last mistake you'll ever make!","This set is amazing and I am very surprised Lego would release a set at this price point with so many highly desirable minifigures, a classic Star Wars vehicle (that is a nice size), and an iconic Star Wars beast. &nbsp;I hope it's not the last ""mistake"" Lego ever makes!<div><br></div><div>As has been mentioned, the first highlight of the set is the minifigures. &nbsp;The Boba Fett from Slave I in 2010 was an excellent figure, but this one tops it with leg printing and a nicer, more sleek gun. &nbsp;In this set, his cape is a also a slightly different color and I believe his face has a bit more scruff. &nbsp;Luke in his classic black RotJ outfit and short, parted hair is a must have and this set seems like one of the easiest ways to get him. &nbsp;Kithaba is a pretty standard looking skiff guard with an old pirate&nbsp;bandanna&nbsp;and a new type of face that looks a bit a like a dog. Some have complained about his bright red pants, but that's what he wears in the movie, oddly enough. &nbsp;In my opinion, Lando in disguise as Tamtel Skreej really steals the show. &nbsp;He has great printing, but his helmet is one of the most nicely detailed Lego head accessories I have seen. &nbsp;The face also really captures the character nicely. I also like the two-piece axe--much better than the old single piece castle axes.</div><div><br></div><div>The sarlacc pit is the next highlight on the list. &nbsp;It's a pretty simple and symmetrical build, but the end result is great. &nbsp;No matter what surface I put it on, it makes me think that it continues down ""underground."" &nbsp;The beak appears to be made from two usually clear cockpit pieces (such as on last years V-Wing), but colored tan--a clever touch. &nbsp;The way the tentacles curve looks lifelike enough as well. Of course, it's just plain fun to throw minifigs into the beast's maw. One note, if you are not a fan of the ""special edition"" sarlacc (where George Lucas added the CGI beak), then it still looks ok without the beak. &nbsp;</div><div>Finally, the vehicle itself--the Bantha II Cargo Skiff, or desert skiff. &nbsp;I was quite surprised at just how long the vehicle was. &nbsp;It has a nice little control deck, storage area for pistols, and of course, the plank for pushing the minifigs into the pit (yeah!). &nbsp;The plank itself is two plates thick because of the flat plates on top. My only complaint is that this makes it impossible for a minifig to hang from the plank with his hands like Luke does to spingboard himself in the movie. &nbsp;The clear pieces on the bottom of the skiff do a nice job of creating a hovering effect. The entire build is simple, yet enjoyable.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is a must-have set at a great price. &nbsp;It's a great way of filling essential gaps in your cast of major characters if you haven't already, it has two nice models, and great play value. &nbsp;It also complements this years Jabba's palace set nicely. Chewy and blinded Han from that set complete the movie scene on this skiff. Likewise, Lando and Boba Fett hang out in Jabba's palace (Kithaba fits right in too) in the movie, and Luke comes to visit. So yeah, get this set!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

It comes from one of the more iconic scenes from Return of the Jedi. This is a remake of the 2000 set by the same name. In Jabba's Sale Barge from 2006 there was a Desert Skiff also included. So... is third time the charm for the Desert Skiff?&nbsp;</div><div><br><div>The Price<br><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I would say an outstanding YES! First off the price. Most new Star Wars sets seem to be floating in the 12-14 cents per piece. This set is a little lower at only 11.7 cents per piece but the set is only $25. That makes it the cheapest in the line but also one of the best. 213 for $25 is pretty good! I'd rate the price 9/10.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div>The Pieces</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The pieces are not that exciting in this set. It is nice to see the canopy piece introduced in the 2011 V-wing in dark tan... but is that really useful? Same thing with the front of the mini speed boat piece from city in brown. The use of those pieces are pretty much solely for this kind of set. Besides that you get a few nice pieces like railing in dark tan. The set includes 4 small guns, a spear with axe blade, and 2 lightsaber hilts... one molded in chrome for Luke, and the other black to go on the tip of Boba's gun. Pieces are nice just not too great. I would say about 7/10.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Build</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Building this set wasn't too long... but it was a little different. It was nice to build a vehicle other than a space ship. No cock pit or anything more of a boat in some ways. The build was more original. One thing my instructions were really thick... and seemed to be made from a better quality paper. What about yours? Build took maybe 15-30 minutes depending on skill level. It gets a solid 8/10 from me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifigures</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Oh boy... these are amazing figures. Luke is brand new and better than ever. His face is the same but features really nice new torso printing front and back. Lando is finally in a cheap set! And he is really awesome. His helmet appears to be the same mold as the one from Jabba's Sail Barge but this time around painted for amazing detail. Kithaba is a brand new character to the Star Wars LEGO Universe. A welcome new figure and has great printing. Boba Fett... of course. Everyone seems to be drooling over the more recent bounty hunter figs and Boba is the best of them all. Pretty much the same as the one from Slave 1... but has leg printing and a different colored cape. Every fig is exclusive and awesome!

<h4>The build</h4><p>the build is easy and take no more than just 15 minutes</p>

Let's start off with the minifigures.&nbsp;<div>First is Luke Skywalker in his robes. He has a green lightsaber and a silver hilt, and black legs. He is wearing a black shirt underneath the tray robes. Luke has his old hair back, instead of his shaggy hair piece in 2011. His face is not double sided.</div><div>&nbsp;Boba Fett was rated the best Star Wars minifigure of 2010, and his new feature is his legs. His helmet is scraped and he has a com link on it. Underneath his helmet he is smirking. Boba's legs have pockets and boots on it. On Boba's back, there is a green jet pack, along with a shoulder cape that is light green. His weapon is a pistol with a black lightsaber hilt on the end.&nbsp;</div><div>Next there is Kithaba, a pirate. His leg piece is full red, with no details on it. Kithaba's torso has a light-armoured shirt, with brown pockets. His face is practically an angler-fish mixed with a bulldog with green skin. He is also wearing a red pirate hat, and his weapon is a pistol.</div><div>&nbsp;Last but not least is Lando Calrissian disguised as a guard.

In the middle of the Skiff, you can open up a lid and there are two pistols inside. The control place has two switches and a small space for the pilot. You can adjust the wings and they have two poles sticking out the side of them. Im happy that LEGO put see-through bricks on the bottom to make it look like its flying. My only complaint about this set is that is you put the sarlacc beneath the Skiff, it won't go under because the Skiff is to low, so I think LEGO should and an extra two or three layers of see-through bricks to the Skiff.</div><div>&nbsp;But overall, this is a very good play set.</div>",FALSE,5,3,4,5,3
"n3y0","2012-09-11T18:53:49.387Z","""As You Wish.""","<p>First of all allow me to be clear- I bought this set for Boba Fett, my second favourite character in the Star Wars universe. (My favourite is Jango of course) At 25.00 USD this set was only worth the money to me because of that character's inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boba Fett</strong></p>
<p>Boba Fett is the reason I bought this set. This is the second issue of the character with the new Mandalorian helmets that are now made by Lego, the first one being with 8097 Slave I. This set's minifigure is based on the&nbsp;ROTJ Fett and not&nbsp;the ESB&nbsp;Fett&nbsp;as in 8097, so it includes a green cape instead of brown and a different blaster. Apart from that, Fett's legs are printed in this set with great detail, including the foot part, making this one incredibly detailed minifigure and by far the best Fett yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Fett, Luke Skywalker is a very nice minifigure. For some reason his torso is mostly grey and not black as in the film, although his lightsabre is a darker green than in previous issues. Lando is different as he is black, and Lego has made very few black minifigures (Lando, Bespin Guard, Mace Windu, Seso, &amp; the basketball players). The other minifigure is an odd alien guy with a dog-like face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skiff</strong></p>
<p>My biggest complaint about the skiff is it's use of tan pieces instead of all brown. In the film it is completely brown, but lego includes tan so it looks as though it's in a desert setting. In it's centre panel there are concealed two smaller blasters and underneath is one of those stupid flick-fire missiles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sarlacc</strong></p>
<p>The Pit of Carcoon adds playability, but even that is limited due to it's height. With Lego Giving you only two levels of transparent bricks under the skiff, the plank Luke is supposed to walk can't even fit over the Pit of Carcoon's edge!</p>

<p>All in all it's a nice set. It may not be worth the money but Lego sets never are these days. I would buy it for the minifigures.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,4
"sudorum","2013-01-21T23:34:25.22Z","Hungry for Boba Fett","&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Basically, all aspects of the previous desert skiff have been improved from its debut in the 2006 Jabba's Sail Barge set. &nbsp;Lando Calrissian is completely redesigned, featuring a new torso, face, and headgear. His former helmet is a monochrome gray, which, though not obvious at the time, appears quite dull and outdated now. Boba Fett has already been improved again, dating from his fairly recent appearance in the 2010 Slave I set, in which his entire makeup was changed. This time around, the alteration is more subtle. Boba's shoulder cloth is now an olive green rather than brown, which is more in line with the movie. Additionally, his legs are printed. &nbsp;Anyway, Luke has some new duds, and to my surprise, a darker green lightsaber blade. Also, instead of a Gamorrean guard, we are supplied with a kithaba skiff guard, who is the only character of the set who has not been introduced into the lego universe before.&nbsp;<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Sarlacc, too, has been changed for the better. The first version neglected the tentacles, which &nbsp;is somewhat strange, considering it was the beak that wasn't added into the film until mad George went on a post-production rampage years later. This Sarlac does have its tentacles, as well as its beak, and Boba can actually fit inside of it to be consumed. The skiff is your standard redesigned model: sleeker curves, improved filmic accuracy, and of course a flick-fire missile, included just for kicks. I never really thought that the desert skiff needed to be redone, but having the new version really makes the older model appear obsolete and dated. To be perfectly honest, I only purchased this set in order to acquire the new Boba, as I was paranoid that the skiff could be his only outing with printed legs. This reasoning is based off of&nbsp;what Lego did with the Boba minifigure circa 2003 when they printed his arms and legs in the Cloud City set. Despite two appearances in 2006, the old Boba minifigure never appeared with such printing again. My theory&nbsp;may not be true, but until I know for sure, I'm keeping Boba carefully preserved.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-02T20:27:29Z","Sarlacc at last","<p><strong>Set #9496 Desert Skiff: </strong>It took around 12 years, but LEGO finally re-designed and remade the Desert Skiff from Return of the Jedi, originally sold as a LEGO set in 2000 the original Desert Skiff was a much smaller set, featuring only two Mini-Figures (Luke and Han) and involving a much simpler build/design which suffered a bit from the era at which it was designed.</p>
<p>Is this new interpretation any better? Read on to find out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is standard from the 2012 era of LEGO Star Wars, showing the Mini-Figures included (all of them brand new) and featuring the Darth Maul design in one corner.</p>
<p>The instructions are made of a thick stock, and would be very difficult to crease. They'd have to be crammed in very awkwardly to damage them in the box, which is an improvement over most other LEGO sets. They are very straightforward on the build and easy to follow. There's also some nice photos in the back showcasing the set in a comic book style of the scene from Return of the Jedi.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>A lot of useful parts in this set, a great many of brown and tan colored pieces and some decently unique parts such as the large brown sloped parts used for the sides of the skiff and the large tan jaw parts for the Sarlacc monster's mouth/beak. These are of course ordinary cockpit pieces, but the unique and rare coloring of them make them great for MOCing some desert warfare vehicles.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>All of these Mini-Figures are brand new.</p>
<p>Jedi Luke Skywalker has a brand new torso with a double-sided print, the rest of him is pretty standard Luke parts, the plain black legs and ordinary bowl-cut blond hair piece isn't much different from what came in the original Desert Skiff. But he's still a nice improvement to the older yellow skinned version.</p>
<p>Kithaba is a Weequay, he is a brand new character and looks pretty accurate to the character seen in the film. He also has a double-sided torso and a great looking facial print, plus a unique Pirate bandana head piece in dark red/maroon. He includes a small blaster pistol.</p>
<p>Lando in Skiff Disguise is the first Lando Mini-Fig I've owned, his weapon is pretty standard Castle affair, a spear with axe head piece attached to resemble the weapons seen in the film. He also has a nice looking head piece and a great looking torso with, again, double-sided printing. The level of detail in the head piece and its paint work just... I am in awe of it.</p>
<p>The big deciding factor for why people are going for this set is, of course, Boba Fett. His Mandalorian Armor looks great, the printing is single-sided for the torso, considering the jet pack covers up the back this is an acceptable design choice. The amount of detail on his leg printing is also quite impressive, is he the best Boba Fett LEGO has ever made? Not sure, I only have two, the one from Jabba's Prize and this one. The upgrade with this Boba Fett is pretty nice in the design choice, it's no Cloud City Boba with arm printing, but it's pretty darn impressive. The half-cape he has and the way his blaster is made is a nice improvement over the older model from Jabba's Prize also.</p>
<p>His helmet also includes all of the Mandalorian parts LEGO first introduced as Clone Helmet attachments, which means you'll have a lot of spare rangefinders and things to give to your Clone Wars Mandalorians if you chose.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This is a numbered bag set. Bag one includes Boba Fett, Luke and the Sarlacc model, which is really just the beak and open maw seen in the film. I'll discuss it in greater detail in the model section, all I can say though is that the design could use a bit of tweaking.</p>
<p>Bags two and three&nbsp;builds Lando, Kithaba and the Skiff itself, which is much larger than its predecessor. The stages of the build aren't too repetitive and a nice change of pace from the more compact design of 2000.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Sarlacc maw is pretty effective at mimicing the design of the on-screen counterpart. If there's one thing I think is a bit off with it is the length of the tentacle limbs, those things are a bit too short in my opinion. I don't know, maybe it's because the mouth/beak is just too large, using the LEGO Cockpit piece is a clever way of making the Sarlacc's mouth, however it does look a bit longer than it should. If the tentacles were longer or the mouth section a bit smaller it could work, trouble is shrinking the mouth would make it harder to fit Mini-Figs inside. Comprimises had to be made I'd imagine.</p>
<p>It's nice to finally have a Sarlacc though, if I'm not mistaken this is actually the first one they offered, at least in a cheaper set, I think the original Sail Barge might have included a similar build, not sure on that.</p>
<p>The Skiff itself is a work of art, it matches much closer to the design from the on-screen vehicle, has more room to fit enough Mini-Figures to re-enact the scene from Return of the Jedi and has a few play features, which the 2000 version did not have.</p>
<p>The plank is retractable, can move in and out so it isn't constantly sticking out like on the 2000 design. There is a flick-fire missile on one side as well, it's hidden from sight though so it isn't out of place on the design like some other vehicles I could mention. And there is a hidden opening panel that allows you to store weapons so the heroic rebels can snatch victory from defeat, escape the Great Pit of Carkoon and rescue the princess.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, for 30$ there is a lot to offer here. The Mini-Figures are all brilliant, Boba is the top pick out of the set, but Lando and Kithaba are both pretty impressive looking as well. The only really ordinary Mini-Fig in the set is Luke, and even then his torso design is a nice fresh take on the character from this point in the film.</p>
<p>The Desert Skiff is the true stand out of the two models built in this set, while it is nice to finally have a Sarlacc to put on the shelf with my other Tatooine display pieces I think it could use a bit more tweaking and wouldn't mind it if LEGO re-visited the concept again some time in the future. Or even just included more structure, perhaps a large sand dome pit to attach it to as part of a different Jedi set.</p>
<p>Still I'd definitely recommend this set as one of the better offerings from 2012, it's no Jabba's Palace, but it does complement the rest of the sets made the past two years that are from this series of scenes and events in the film. It's definitely a vast improvement over the original 2000 design, the clear stand parts raise the vehicle higher off the shelf as well meaning it doesn't hug the ground so much. Top marks LEGO.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"legoholic","2013-10-22T00:05:11.117Z","Has its Pros and Cons","<p>After buying Jabba's Sail Barge 75020, I needed this set. I already had Desert Skiff 7104, but this set only had Han and Luke figs and lacked a Sarlacc pit. This set was ""bigger"" than I expected, with three numbered bags and a thick instructions pamphlet.</p>
<p>The first thing you build is the Sarlacc pit (and Luke and Boba Fett minifigs, but I'll be covering those later). In the movie the Sarlacc is characterized by its many rows or sharp teeth, which this model lacks. Of course, you couldn't really make a realistic Sarlacc without elevating the whole thing a ton, which can be a huge problem. Also the Sarlacc's beaked tounge is unrealistically large, yet this allows for the awesome play feature where the Sarlacc can ""eat"" minifigures. Conclusively, I like the Sarlacc pit.</p>
<p>The Skiff its self is impressive, but doesn't serve it's purpose,&nbsp;complimenting the Sail Barge,&nbsp;very well. The scale is immensely different, the Skiff being the larger one. It is closer to minifigure scale, though. Lego probably didn't know they were going to make a Sail Barge anytime soon so they made it too big. Then when Lego was making the Barge they didn't want the price to be more than it already was. I like how the plank can fold in, but the plank sets the Skiff off balance and is on the wrong side if you wanted to have the Skiff and the Barge facing the same way but able to see Jabba out the window and be able to see Luke walk into the Sarlacc pit at the same time. Speaking of the Sarlacc pit, the Skiff isn't elevated enough for Luke to walk&nbsp;off the plank; the plank is&nbsp;level with the Sarlacc pit.&nbsp;Something I liked that they squeezed in was the flick-fire missle on the underside for extra playability. Another is the gun compartment.</p>

""- C-3PO","<p>I got this set yesterday at my local Target, where it was on sale for 3 dollars off. I could have had a better sale, but the set was well worth it in my opinion, even at full price. The set features a lot of playability for younger ones what with all of the weapons and minifigures included, and the set looks a lot like the actual ship in ""Return of the Jedi"". Without further ado, let's move on to my pros and cons list and discover what makes or breaks this set. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>All of the minifigures on display in this set really make it a worthwhile play set for younger ones, as well as including main characters from the film to show some nice display for adults. <br></li><li>The best play function ever is also here; the bridge of death! As though the actual design of the ship wasn't amazing enough, the way that the plank is built in is just a little cherry on top (or in-between in this case). <br></li><li>Due to the limitations that a set this size imposes, the Sarlacc has to be sacrificed. It's not full scale for sure, but it still looks very recognizable and realistic. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I gladly would have paid an additional five bucks for a more detailed and/or larger Sarlacc because this one feels small-ish. <br></li><li>The combination of the tan and dark brown pieces feels a tiny bit off; it doesn't matter too much, but I do want it to be a bit less common. <br></li><li>The instructions are very nice; they are printed on much thicker paper, they are significantly heavier, and have a more quality feel to them. However, this could raise prices, and these are only found in this set. If it becomes more common, however, I will reconsider this tiny detail. <br></li></ul>
<p>This set depicts one of the best scenes of the Star Wars saga in a perfect light; it's small, inexpensive, and sleek. It's relatively sturdy and recognizable. If you have a chance, get it when you can. Disappointed you will be not. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Chills","2013-01-17T12:23:47.983Z","Cool set, great minifigures.","<p>I got Jabba's Sail Barge 6210 last summer so when this new desert skiff came out I wasn't sure if it would make it on my ""wanted"" list. After checking out the improvements and the minifigures I put it on the list, and recently it was on sale on Amazon so the set found its way into my collection. I'm quite pleased with it and am happy to display it next to Jabba's Palace and the Rancor Pit.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The biggest pro with this set are the minifigures, which are all unique to this set. Boba Fett, especially, is so detailed, and all new. His legs and torso have fantastic printing, he has a small tattered cape, and a cool jet pack. His helmet is the same from the Mandalorians in the battle pack, but his has the view finder on the side. Luke and Lando have decent detail on their torsos, and Kithaba is a new figure altogether. All are great additions for your collection.<br></li><li>Pro 2: This version of the desert skiff looks wonderful, and much more detailed and movie-like than the previous version. The use of the large curved pieces on the back and the long nose section create a realistic look for the skiff. There's also a compartment for blasters and the extending plank to push victims off to the Sarlacc. <br></li><li>Pro 3: Speaking of the Sarlacc, this one is different where you can actually fit a minifigure inside. And there are two tentacles, which the previous version lacked. <br></li><li>Pro 4: The pieces are pretty cool in this set and you get some unique colors. I really dig the different sand tans and browns Lego has been using for the Tatooine sets this year.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The only con I can think of is with the Sarlacc pit. It's smaller than the one from 6210, where I feel Lego should have actually made it bigger. And the white ""claws/teeth"" are pointed vertically in this set. They should be horizontal curving toward the mouth like the last set. <br></li></ul>
<p>When it comes to Star Wars sets this one is a pretty good bang for your buck. You get some fantastic minifigures, a fun build with decent playability, and cool pieces for your MOCs. The skiff is quite well-done and looks just like the movie skiff. The less-than-perfect Sarlacc pit is still decent, and no reason to skip this set.

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-06-20T05:59:47.943Z","Wonderful minifigures and great looking set","<p>So Boba Fett has to be one of the most expensive readily available minifigures on the second hand market. I&nbsp;also didn&#39;t&nbsp;have any Tatooine sets from Return of the Jedi, which&nbsp;made this set very tempting.&nbsp;When I saw that I can pick up this set for less than the original price I had to get it. Sure I paid a bit extra for shipping, but I would have had to pay tax in the store so it&#39;s a wash. Anyways, I couldn&#39;t be happier with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Obviously Boba Fett is the star and he is beautifully detailed. A wonderful addition to my collection, although he is technically my 2nd copy of him as I have the child version of him with Jango&#39;s Slave I. Hopefully the rumors about him appearing in season 2 of the Mandalorian will be true and I&#39;ll be able to place him in my Razor Crest once it arrives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is Lando disguised as a guard. He too is another minifigure that can be hard to come by, the only other one I own is with the Kessel Run Falcon. Sure, he is in costume, and it must be paining him not to have a cape, but it is an excellent looking minifigure that I&#39;m glad to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The other unique one is Kithaba. Overall I&#39;m not too impressed with him, aside from his skin color, he doesn&#39;t really look like an alien. In fact, he could fit in as a criminal in a police set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if this is a unique version of Luke, but given that I have quite a collection of Luke&#39;s, this one isn&#39;t too exciting unless you don&#39;t have one dressed in black. The hair is the old boring version which has been much improved recently. However given the importance of him in this scene, you got to have him.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get Han or Chewie, but no doubt you probably already have enough of them and there is plenty of room to include them on the skiff as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Build</p>

<p>The first bag is the sarlac. It&#39;s a rather simple straightforward build, but it does the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The next two bags build the skiff. I didn&#39;t expect anything too exciting given the number of parts, and of course nothing too exciting is what you get with this build. But there&#39;s nothing wrong with a nice quick build, and you wouldn&#39;t really want this set to be any bigger anyways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Model</p>

<p>I must say I&#39;m awfully impressed in how well everything looks. The sarlac looks great, and while his head is a little too enlongated, it is very easy to feed minifigures to it, Boba Fett can even keep his gun. It would be nice if the Pit of Carcoon was built up a bit more, and I can certainly see creating a play feature that would allow the sarlac to emerge and close its mouth, but that of course would make the sarlac a set in itself, I think it will be something very fun to figure out how to MOC myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The skiff too looks great. Lego did as great a job as you could expect of them in making the curves and I love how it sits up high on a clear base. It has plenty of room for all the minifigures, and like I said, Han and Chewie could easily be added to the mix. The plank that swings out is also a very nice touch, allowing it to cross the desert, and then extend the plank. While it is too low to feed anyone to the sarlac, it wouldn&#39;t have made any sense to have a taller base, as it is it can tip over a little too easily. It is impressively large for a set with so few parts. It also has two&nbsp;other play features, storage for blasters&nbsp;in the center bench, and a flick fire missile underneath. Obviously those blasters will come in handy for Han and Chewie, although&nbsp;the flick fire missile is definitely out of place. Luckily it is completely out of view and could always be removed if it&nbsp;bothers you that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I would say this an excellent set, and the minifigures make it an absolute bargain. Given it&#39;s very small part count, you would be hard pressed to find a better set of similar size.&nbsp;I highly recommend getting this set if you have the chance. The only problem is it&#39;s gonna make you want to get the sail barge to go with it.&nbsp;</p>
