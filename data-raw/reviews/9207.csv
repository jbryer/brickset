"David1971","2012-07-18T17:06:23.533Z","A sort of art deco starfighter, very nice","Well I seem to be the first to post a regular Brickset review of this set! Although Huw has already posted an <a href=""http://brickset.com/news/article/?ID=3608"">excellent photo review</a> within the News category. He has described it all well, so I will just add a few personal reflections.<div><br></div><div>So ... it's a lovely set. Strange, perhaps, to get a Star Wars set without any of the regular recognisable Star Wars characters, but this is from Star Wars: The Old Republic, which (I gather from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic"">Wikipedia</a>) is a massively multiplayer online game which has only really been going during 2012, so this is actually a quite timely bit of merchandise (from the, er, 35 year-old franchise).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also learn that Star Wars: The Old Republic is set ""more than 3,500 years before the events in the Star Wars films"", which seems, ahem, surprising, because the technology looks like it comes from, say, 50 years before the events in the Star Wars films. (I've watched the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lrk2BE4Tqc"">trailers</a>). It's bizarre that most of the Old Republic ships and technologies look pretty much like the ones in the films, if 3,500 years are meant to have passed. But I digress.</div><div><br></div><div>The *nice* thing about this ship -- yes, I'm back on the Lego set now, sorry -- is that it looks to me like a kinda <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco"">1930s style</a> of spaceship, which is lovely. When it was first announced, I remember some people online saying it looked clunky and ugly, but I don't think that's true, it's very stylish, and in particular makes very good use of different coloured small plates and pieces to give it interesting detail -- rather than using stickers, of which there are none (hurray!). I love the pink engines at the back, and the moveable wings lock into position with a reassuring click.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigs are very nice, especially the female pilot (Satele Shan, it says here) who looks suitably fiesty, and the 1930s R2 unit (as I would call it) is cute and amusing.</div><div><br></div><div>You can see how this style of spaceship predates the X-Wing, so that's clever (although as I say, it looks like it came a few decades earlier rather than a few millennia earlier, but never mind).</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is a really nice ship, and a great set, with a very pleasing swooshy design, good minifigs, and it really is great that it looks perfect without any stickers.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Blockland","2012-07-29T22:47:31.547Z","Good Set","<p>I went to Target a couple days ago and found this laying behind some old sets. I picked it up for 50$ and went home to build this set.

"Duq","2013-01-16T18:39:36.267Z","You may not know the ship but this set works for everyone","<p>This ship is from the Star Wars 'Old Republic', as is shown by the steampunkish looking logo on the front of the box. I'm a bit of a SW fan, mainly the old trilogy. I didn't know this ship but when I found it on offer I just picked it up, mainly for the design. I was pleasantly surprised.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box certainly looks big enough for the price but is quite spacious for the three numbered bags and instruction book. It's from the last series of 'Sith' boxes and shows the ship from various angles. The front of the box makes it clear that all three characters are new.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The pilot of the ship is called Satele Shan. Satele is wearing a sleeveless sand green outfit with dark grey gloves, her dark brown hair in a long pony tail. Her head has a double print, happy/angry. For unknown reasons there is also a nameless trooper in a white/red suit. His head has only a single expression. His gun is so big it would make Rambo blush...</p><p>The third character is R2-D2's steampunk cousin. The legs are the same as R2 but the body is brick built, with a nicely printed tile and two printed dishes.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building the ship is easy; 58 pages of instructions for 376 pieces is rather generous. No strange building techniques; nearly everything is studs up. The movable wings are done with plate hinges, using clips and bars to lock them into place in either position. No click hinges in sight.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is an interesting looking ship. With the wings forward the shape reminds me of all those Jedi wedges from the prequel trilogy, with the wings back there's a clear similarity with the X-wing in the shape of the wings, the engine placement and the long guns under the wings. Of course there are only 2 wings on this ship though. And unlike the X-wing this ship does not have room for a droid.<br></p><p>The colour scheme works well, mainly dark red and white with a few orange and dark grey touches. Unfortunately like so many ships this carries flick missiles. They can only be used with the wings in the back position. When the wings are forward they awkwardly protrude sideways from under the wings. Luckily they're easily removed.</p><p>On the flip side of course those flick-missiles add playability to a very swooshable ship. Add to that the moving wings, clever storage for the double light saber and extra characters and you have a decent play set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection in this set is all good news. No stickers but nicely printed pieces instead. Curved pieces in dark red, tiles in dark red, white, orange and red. A proper metallic silver light saber hilt, not the cheap grey version. Some hinges and clips and strangely a handful of dark tan 1x2 plates.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>At full retail price of €48 here in Ireland (which, US readers, at the current exchange rate is $64!) it is just very expensive for the 376 pieces you get, there's no way around it. Get it at a discount however and you have a Lego set that works for everyone; it's a well designed ship that would look good displayed on a shelf, it's playable and it's an interesting parts pack.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,2
"Matt_mason","2012-12-16T13:53:17.29Z","Get down to ASDA now. ","David1971's review is spot on. I just picked this up at ASDA for £22 which is a saving of £17.99 which is no bad thing. I love the set it is small but perfect in every way. The minifigures are all new to this set and are great. Lego if you are listening can we please have stands for these models as we like to display them..<div><br></div><div>Matt.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Chills","2012-12-27T23:08:59.463Z","A quick and agile fighter to take on the evil Sith Interceptor!","<p>Though I haven't played SWTOR I really like all of the cool ships, characters, and books that have come from the game. I recently built the Fury Interceptor 9500 and I like the set a lot. So I just had to have the Striker Fighter to do battle with the interceptor. Even though this set is smaller it is no less a fantastic set. It is well designed, great playability, and fun build.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: I really like the look of this set. It looks like the grandpa of the X-wing, when the wings are extended; and the A-wing, when the wings are folded forward. The colors are bold red and dark red with with striping. The forward fuselage also has printed on graphics! No stickers! Thank you Lego.</li><li>Pro 2: The design is pretty cool. It is solid and swooshable, most of the set is plates stacked which makes it quite rigid. When the wings fold forward the cannons swing out nicely. The wings also snap in place, which is a nice addition to the solid feeling. I have to say I even like how Lego designed the flick-fire missile pods. They are under the wings and are launched with technic axles with the stoppers at the end. Its a much better design than used in the past.</li><li>Pro 3: The details are also there. The cockpit is full of printed plates and even a set of handlebars for controls. After recent build with sparse cockpits its nice to have one that's full of detail. The engines, the cannons, and the forward wings also are nicely detailed; which also makes the build a lot of fun. The rear even has clips to hold the light saber and blades with a little door to cover them.</li><li>Pro 4: The set comes with 3 mini figures. A Jedi with a double-bladed saber (the only one I know of), a Republic trooper, and a droid. The first two have a lot of printing on their torsos and even on the legs, and the trooper has a great heavy gun; and the droid keeps the predecessor-look going by being a bigger, clunkier version of an R2. This droid even as a wheel on the back. All these figures are great additions to your collection.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I think some retractable landing gear would be a cool addition.</li></ul>
<p>This set meets almost all the criteria I feel a good starship should have. It is well designed, fun to build, solid and swooshable, and has great playability. Like I mentioned, landing gear is the only thing I think Lego could have added; that would give this set 5 bricks in my view. Even without the gear this is a great set to have. It seems to me that Lego reads these reviews and keeps improving their sets with each year. This is a great set and definitely looks great next to the Rebel star fighters. Plus the mini figures are way cool.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"plantman","2012-09-03T04:01:54.83Z","Great for kids, a little simple for adult fans","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set is great for kids - transforming wings and blasters and the fact that it's a ship are great play points.&nbsp; I love the fact that it is an Old Republic theme (still wishing for Knights of the Old Republic stuff). That said,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is a great judged with older sets - but&nbsp;placed&nbsp;with the current wave, it&nbsp;seems&nbsp;a bit simple...&nbsp; As with most of the Lego sets I see coming out the piece count seems slightly inflated with tiny 1 stud pieces and flats.&nbsp; I compare this with the 7140 X-Wing which has 70% of the piece count and manages seems like a more complex ship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,4
"aliasangelalias","2013-03-21T14:15:15.947Z","A little above average set compare to the Sith Fury Class Interceptor","The fighter seem a bit too flat (not enough depth) and the under Undercarriage 
of the ship rather plain or dull.&nbsp; The 9500 Sith Fury Class Interceptor 
(villain) was design and engineered much better then this Striker-Class fighter by many 
miles.<br><br>The red seem two shade too bright. It doesn't fit into the 
Republic color scheme.&nbsp; It would be nice to see this color mule to match 
aesthetic with the other Republic vehicles in the Lego line.<br><br>The wings 
fold out mechanism is clever but would be better if it is at a 15 degree slanted 
angle unless the source material of this ship is not slanted.<br><br>No stickers guy! Bravo, thank you Lego!! Please continue to print on the pieces.<br><br>The 
minifigures are amazing and it is definitely the main draw for this set 
unfortunately. To be honest, this fighter is not the reason for my purchase. The minifigures in this set are the major pulling factors for me and all EU Star 
Wars fans.<br><br>As for the price, Lego completely over priced this set. I picked up for $40 and still felt it should be about $30-$35.&nbsp; The price needs to be fair to consumer. With grossing 3 billion dollars in 2012 and 
profit at 1 billion dollars,&nbsp; they need to pass some of the saving to 
consumer.&nbsp; For average home with two kids, these sets is too pricey and some 
family look for other brick brands for better bargain. We know they have good 
quality bricks but the kids are not going to know the differences and less 
parents are going to agree with expensive toys for their children. As an adult collector, this set not only pricy but the design of the ship seem as flat as a thin crust pizza.<br><br>All in all, this is just above average for the price you paying.&nbsp; The Lego 9500 Sith Fury Class is a much better clever ship overall compare to this Striker-Class Fighter.<br><br>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"LegoisComing","2013-07-01T16:59:31.58Z","Fairly simple, but fun Star Wars starship.","<p>For me this set was an impulse purchase and I almost didn't even get it.&nbsp; A few months ago I had gotten the Sith Fury Interceptor because I thought it looked awesome and I wanted to know how the slanted wings were built.&nbsp; Then I realized, not being a ToR player, that this Striker ship was it's companion.&nbsp; My initial thoughts prior to purchasing it was ""well it just looks like a red Z-95, I guess this is one way ToR is being tied, visually, to the technology present in the OT era"".&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is, well, a box.&nbsp; It's got some cardboard and stuff.&nbsp; Looks great and is spacious.&nbsp; Instructions were clear.&nbsp; Make sure you have good lighting or it will be difficult to differentiate dark red and regular red.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Perhaps my favorite part of the build.&nbsp; There are many great parts, plates mostly, to add to your collection.&nbsp; If you're building a moc with red and dark red this is a great set to pick up.</p><p>Also there's no stickers to worry about.&nbsp; The two long dark red slope pieces have white printing on them.&nbsp; Typically I think printing on larger bricks reduce their usefulness for mocs.&nbsp; However, the printing on these two is generic enough that it would work for most star ship moc builds anyways.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4>The characters from The Old Republic are new to me.&nbsp; You can see them in action in the video game trailer.&nbsp; They are certainly awesome in that video.&nbsp; The figures look great.&nbsp; The trooper guy could have had a helmet.&nbsp; His beast of a gun is a bit tricky to get him to hold right.&nbsp; I prefer the similar gun you get in 75001.&nbsp; Satele looks vicious enough.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to be getting my Sith on in any galaxy near her.&nbsp; The droid is rather unique as well.&nbsp; A bit of a change from the round droids we typically get.&nbsp; The body printing is actually a 2x2 tile with droid-y printing on it.&nbsp; That piece could come in handy for detail other mocs too.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>No complicated technic techniques, nor any significant snot sections make this a rather simple and easy build.&nbsp; The wings can be built simultaneously rather than one after the other if you want a very slight challenge.&nbsp; The cockpit is spacious and the flight stick design is quite clever.&nbsp; One thing I really like about this ship is how easy it is to customize a bit.&nbsp; You can change up the white tiles for different wing-stripe patterns.&nbsp; The bottom of the Striker ship is relatively flat unfortunately.&nbsp; But it's simple enough to add some 6-wide inverted slope pieces to add some shape to the bottom of the main hull.</p><p>Much like the current Tie-Fighter set, it comes with a droid.&nbsp; But the ship does not utilize a droid.&nbsp; Though, from reading about this ship online it apparently can be modified to take a droid.&nbsp; It's possible you could re-build the back section and make a droid socket for the little guy.&nbsp; I have no idea how faithful that would be to the design of the ship in the video game.<br></p><h4>The completed model</h4>It looks great!&nbsp; Definitely stands out due to being overwhelmingly red, especially with the contrasting white stripes.&nbsp; The hinged wings are fairly secure and function easily enough.&nbsp; Swooshing it around (yea we AFOLs do this still...) is a bit difficult because there isn't really a solid and secure place to hold it.&nbsp; The engines are too close together to get more than 1 (maybe two) fingers between to hold it.&nbsp; And it feels like you have to be careful when holding it by the engines.&nbsp; A younger person would probably have an easier time with that.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you like smaller Star Wars star ships you've got to pick this one up!&nbsp; It looks very distinctive, which is surprising considering how simple the design is.&nbsp; It is not a remake of an already popular ship.&nbsp; Perhaps it is some sort of predecessor to the Z-95 Headhunter.&nbsp; This is likely the only time they'll make this specific star ship(as well as the Sith Interceptor) so if you are on the fence then pick it up!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
"aredotam","2013-09-19T21:27:58.523Z","Surprisingly fun set!","<p>The Republic Striker-class Starfighter is one of the few current sets based on the Old Republic online video game. As such, it might be an obscure addition to the Star Wars sets for most people but it still has good appeal.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigures - I bought this set almost exclusively for the minifigures Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan, Republic trooper Jace Malcom, and the astromech droid T7-01. These are unique to the Striker and are very accurate when compared to the characters in the video game. The only reservation I had was that Malcom comes with black hair instead of a helmet.</li><li>Great detail - The overall color scheme wasn't appealing to me at first, but the detailing makes the Striker look great. The red, white, and orange pieces on top of the base color create interesting patterns and add more to the building experience. The layout and controls in the cockpit are unique (at least from the sets I've built) and well done.</li><li>Good play value - The Striker is more versatile than it initially appears. The wings and blaster cannons fold and unfold, minifigures fit easily inside of the cockpit, and there is a place for lightsaber storage on the hull behind the cockpit. The flick-missiles under each wing are also easy to use.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A few shaky pieces - While the Striker is a sturdy ship overall, there are a few pieces that I think are too flimsy. The blaster cannons look great but sometimes lose pieces when moved too hastily, or bumped against a sturdier object. The two ""fins"" on the nose of the ship add interesting detail but can pop off pretty easily (they also pop back on easily). I also have concerns about the small pieces that lock the wings into position. So far they're very sturdy and I haven't had any issues with the wings popping out of place. Fortunately, if the durability decreases, the pieces are very common and easy to replace.</li><li>Landing gear - Four pieces on the bottom of the ship serve as the ""landing gear."" Personally I think they're too short - the Striker sits flush to the ground - but a person doesn't need to worry about the pieces coming off.</li><li>Price - I believe the Striker is probably overpriced by five to ten dollars. However, it is a very unique set and Star Wars Legos always run at a higher price than other themes.</li></ul><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall, I think the Striker-class Starfighter is a great Lego set. I bought it primarily for the minifigures and was greatly surprised by the ship itself. It's appealing enough to put on display and durable enough to play with. This would be a great addition to Star Wars and space-themed Lego fans.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"tomalphin","2014-01-13T02:39:03.8Z","A perfectly decent brightly-colored ship and some nice minifigs","<p><strong>About me:</strong> I am an AFOL who has been building at least 1 set each year for my whole life. I build most sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions, but chose to use the instructions as this is a set that came out of a bulk lot that I plan to sell, so I wanted to complete it quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Impressions:</strong> While I am not knowledgeable about the Old Republic subtheme, I really enjoy the original trilogy.&nbsp; At first glance, this looks like a straightforward build and I like the brighter colors compared to other Star wars ships.&nbsp; The minifigures also looked good, especially the brick-built droid.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong>: This was a quick build, and it didn&#39;t have any surprises.&nbsp; I like how even simple sets are including the list of pieces being added in each step - this makes it much easier to assemble a model quickly and correctly (I have struggled with missing noncritical pieces in the past.)&nbsp; Highlights of the build include the wings which can snap into place forward, and the clever little bot build.&nbsp; Naturally, it is a bit repetitive, as it is a symmetrical design.</p>

<p><strong>Finished model:</strong> Good looking for it&#39;s size and well built, so I expect it would be durable to play.&nbsp; I like the mix of angled and curved surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 5/10 on a 10 point scale.&nbsp; It loses some since I&#39;m not familiar with this subtheme, but it also loses me a little on the haphazard looking wing decoration and the fact that the ship can only carry one of the three minifigures.</p>
