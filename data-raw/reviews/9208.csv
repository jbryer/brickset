"tkettle9719","2012-12-25T13:40:45.513Z","Return of the Star Wars Advent Calendar!","<p>I got this at Target on Black Friday after waiting for it to decrease in
 price for the last few months, and I was ready to start building it. 
After the twenty-five days of building, it is time to review this year's
 festive celebration of Lego Star Wars. I'll admit that I was a bit 
skeptical at first about this set because last year's was so good. Will 
this one be as good as last year's? As was done for the 2011 calendar, I
 have decided to do this review on whether I think the set was good or 
not. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4><ul><li><b>DAY ONE</b>: Gungan Sub- an excellent version of the submarine in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, built in 13 pieces and instantly recognizable. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWO</b>: Gungan Soldier- The 3-piece minifigure is an excellent army builder, and looks ready for battle. His detailing is superb. <br></li><li><b>DAY FOUR</b>: Imperial Star Destroyer- First seen in <i>A New Hope</i>, the first Original Trilogy set of the Calendar is well-built and beautiful in all of its 14 pieces.&nbsp;</li><li><b>DAY SEVEN</b>:
 Naboo Starfighter: This model is very impressive indeed; this is the 
smoothest set yet, and it is the most recognizable of the mini ships. 
And my favorite set of the bunch is all done in 16 pieces! <br></li><li><b>DAY EIGHT: </b>Vulture
 Droid: Although I disliked this 9-piece set initially, it soon caught 
my heart after I realized that it was well-designed off of its source as
 well as functional with the wings. <br></li><li><b>DAY NINE</b>: AT-AT 
Driver: I may already have enough of these little guys, but these 
4-piece Drivers are great for army building and aren't trololo's like 
the Battle Droids.&nbsp;</li><li><b>DAY TWELVE</b>: Hoth Rebel Officer: This 
may be a minifig I already have, but it doesn't hurt to have more 
non-trololo characters in the army of six-piece minifigs. <br></li><li><b>DAY THIRTEEN</b>:
 Gonk Droid- A more brick-built version of the Gonk Droid is nice, 
simple, and doesn't need any new pieces. Very nice for 14 pieces.&nbsp;</li><li><b>DAY FIFTEEN</b>:
 Snowtrooper: Although we all have enough of these, it still is cool to 
get a realistic Snowtrooper with a real face. Four piece figure army 
time!<br></li><li><b>DAY SIXTEEN</b>: Naboo Royal Starship: 18 pieces 
were used very well to create this small set that Lego refuses to make 
after 13 years, but this will do for now...<br></li><li><b>DAY SEVENTEEN</b>: Flash Speeder: Fourteen pieces were used in an inventive method to make the recognizable green speeder of Naboo. <br></li><li><b>DAY EIGHTEEN</b>: Rebel Scout Trooper: Five pieces are all it takes to make this character which I had none of until now. <br></li><li><b>DAY NINETEEN</b>: The <i>Lapiz Cutter<b>- </b></i>Although I don't really like this ship, it is quite sleek and accurate to the original material with 15 pieces. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWENTY</b>:
 General Grievous' Starfighter-&nbsp; 14 pieces make this set look fantastic 
given its size. Small details make this set that much better. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWENTY-ONE</b>: Super Battle Droid- Another unique minifigure for me, it still has a nice look and is very accurate in design. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWENTY-TWO</b>: Sith Infiltrator- It takes 15 pieces to make this excellent version of Darth Maul's personal starship. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWENTY-THREE</b>: Snowman R2-D2- The is the best of the minifigures because it just makes sense, especially with that top hat. <br></li><li><b>DAY TWENTY-FOUR</b>: Santa Darth Maul- This is the one that I waited for, and I was not disappointed at all. Very good design. <br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li><b>DAY THREE</b>: Gungan Weapons Pack- Although I really liked the 
catapult in this set, the 8 pieces could have been used more effectively
 than just using another day to extend this Gungan soldier. <br></li><li><b>DAY FIVE</b>:
 MTT: Although it looks like the source model, it is ineffective due to 
the size of 9 tiny pieces. This year's TIE fighter-sized mini kit 
without a doubt. <br></li><li><b>DAY SIX</b>: Security Battle Droid: 
Although this is a unique minifigure in my collection, it fails to 
impress because I have far too many battle droids made of the same five 
pieces (with varied coloring).&nbsp;</li><li><b>DAY TEN</b>: AT-AT: Although 
it looks like an obvious AT-AT, it looks weak and unsleek as the other 
sets do. It was a nice try, however, with only 13 pieces. <br></li><li><b>DAY ELEVEN</b>: Atgar P-Tower: Another nice attempt, but it takes more than six pieces to construct a cannon. <b><br></b></li><li><b>DAY FOURTEEN</b>:
 Ultimate Weapons Pack: Although the weapons are nice here, the majority
 of these ten pieces should be given to the minifigs and this space 
should be used more effectively.&nbsp; </li></ul>

<p>This is an excellent calendar. Although the models here were not as good
 as last years' peaks, they were overall better than last year's. This 
set is proof that the Star Wars Advent Calendar is still worth 40 
dollars (the price I got it at). If you have time, get it. You will not be 
disappointed at all!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,3
