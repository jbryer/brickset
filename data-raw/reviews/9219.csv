"Odeinoichus","2012-12-04T16:23:05.473Z","Blot out the Stars","<p>Set #30056 Star Destroyer: Another excellent Polybagged set from LEGO featuring a brillaint mini-model ship build.</p>
<p>The Star Destroyer uses a lot of gray, light and dark is the primary color scheme on this model, naturaly. Therefore you won't find many unique or rare pieces in hard-to-find colors. What you will find is a small, easily built Star Destroyer perfect for Brick Films and Dioramas and even great for just playing with in your office when the work day is slow.</p>
<p>It's another win with LEGO, Polybags and Star Wars, and a cheap alternative to trying to track down the Mini-Figure scaled Destroyer or the Midi-Scaled one, both of which can be difficult to come by these days. If you can find them for a good price be sure to grab more than one of these.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"Huge_Nerd","2012-12-14T12:55:28.59Z","Super mini Star Destroyer","I picked this up on an impulse a while back. &nbsp;It's a really nice little model of an iconic Star Wars ship. While not in scale with the fighter-type ships that come in polybags, it is in a good scale with the recent polybag Republic Cruiser. &nbsp;The parts aren't anything special and the colors are pretty basic, but the finished model looks good and makes it worth picking up.",FALSE,4,3,3,3,4
"Chills","2013-01-28T09:10:04.2Z","A cool version of the backbone of the Imperial Navy","<p>In my quest to collect all of the sets with a Star Destroyer I had to have this one. There as so many versions of the Star Destroyer that I'm sure it is hard
 for Lego designers to come up with different ways of creating the same 
ship. This one is slightly smaller in size than 4492, but larger than the ship included in 10221.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off the price of this set was pretty good, giving it a Price per piece of under 10 cents US. So good marks there. It wouldn't be hard to buy a bunch of these and build quite the fleet.<br></li><li>Pro 2: As for the design, Lego did a decent job. Most of the angles are correct, and there's a smattering of colors other than light bley used in the set. The necessary details are there: the 3 main engines, the bridge tower, and the domes on the edges.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was enjoyable and straight-forward. It reminded me of the models in the Planet Sets. This is my first polybag (shocking right?) so I can't compare it to others, but I rather enjoyed this one so I'll be on the lookout for more.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The underside is unfinished, it should be symmetrical with the top, but Lego just left it flat. </li></ul>
<p>If you're looking for an inexpensive little set that's got a decent cool-factor then I'd grab one of these. The pieces are also good to use in your MOCs; enough of these sets and you could build a larger Star Destroyer. Overall I am pleased with this set, and I have my eye out for the last Destroyer I need for my collection. <br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,4

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is sealed in a polybag and the instructions are very small size.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are not a lot of parts and not very exclusive parts but they are good standard pieces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building was fast it didn&acute;t take more than a few minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a nice set to have. You can have it for display or play with it though it has not many play features.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For me it was a&nbsp;nice free mini set overall.</p>
