This is a classic prequel vehicle and no Naboo battle scene is complete without at least one. &nbsp;This is my first STAP and I display it proudly with the Battle of Naboo set from last year--it goes great! &nbsp;The set itself has some interesting pieces, such as a the clear pieces that form the stand, giving the perfect illusion of flight. &nbsp;Lightsaber hilts are pretty ubiquitous by now, but they are always fund to have.

<p>The polybag illustration is nothing to shout about, but I was not expecting a puny pamphlet-sized instruction sheet. Minor issue but the instructions are concise and easy to follow even for a young Lego builder.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not that many pieces in this mini set, but the extra droid arm, round piece and the small T-joint piston thingy are great for having around if you&#39;re fiddling with miniature MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The B1 Battle Droid is a standard tan colored version. However, with the flatness in color, you could easily buy a bunch of these and paint on the rank stripes as per the Clone Wars animation series. My only gripe is that it could have at least come with a backpack of some sort and a blaster as a weapon. Then again there&#39;s always other sources to get a weapon or two for the &quot;naked&quot; droid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is probably one of the most simplest models I ever had the chance to build. I think only the small Creator polybags will give this one the run for the title of simplest polybag build ever.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Completion should take no longer than 5 minutes, given as how simple this build is. For a simple build, the end result is pretty good to look at.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Buy it if you need the parts or the clear display stand, or just to build an army of Battle Droids. It takes up very little space so 1 or 2 will be good for a&nbsp;battle display. For advanced builders, you might want to steer clear of this polybag, but for completists like myself, it is a definite must-have. Price-wise, I shall not comment since the cost to acquire this polybag would differ from country to country.</p>
