"bluelion3","2012-01-06T12:05:55.907Z","Lots of weapons","<p>This set was free if you spent $75 or more from the US LEGO S@H website or from LEGO stores from Dec 26, 2011 to Jan 31, 2012.&nbsp; It was not for sale.<br><br>It included a lenticular playing card and a special ""Spinner Crown"" for the Spinjitzu game.&nbsp; These are probably pretty exciting if you play Spinjitzu or collect the cards.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; New Kendo helmet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine weapons.&nbsp; Nine!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; FREE! (value $4.99 per LEGO)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pitchfork!<br></p>
<ul></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Same old Jay torso, head, and legs from the first wave of Ninjago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Armor available in other sets<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendo Jay will appear again in 9446 - Destiny's Bounty<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese plastic<br><br></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>This is not bad as freebies go.&nbsp; The new helmet looked nice, but mine seemed to fit loosely because it bumps against the armor on his shoulders.&nbsp; I had fun putting together the NINE weapons and couldn't decide which one Jay should hold.&nbsp; I especially liked the pitchfork.<br><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set itself comes in a rather large polybag which contains all the parts. The finished set includes the ninja jay in kendo form with a nice new helmet piece as well as lots of weapons incluuding an axe, pitch fork and other unique weapons built from other parts as well as a spinner part. There is also a card included [probably for the use of the cardgame]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building experience is quite simple however as no instructions are included this is complicated slightly. The playability of this set alone is very lackluster as there is almost nothing the set can do alone. Because of this, I highly sugguest buying at least one of the spinner sets for ninjago battle. If you don't have any spinners for this set, One possible option is to find an older spinner from 2011 and canabalise it for the use of this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value for money on this set is completely outstanding for the reason that you get it free on all orders over £50 which was on in january. Unfortunately during the writing of the review, this offer has appeared to have ended. Although the offer is still going, the freebie object has been replaced been a ninja jay keyring which in my view is not as impressive. This may be perhaps due to a shortage of quantities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this set to any one who loves ninjago, ninja's and who ever wants a free purchase. If this set is still availible anywhere, I would recommend it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,1,5
