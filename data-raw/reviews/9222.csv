"Monty","2012-08-09T00:40:42.14Z","Claasy Tractor","I haven’t bought a Technic set for a while as the subjects have not interested me that much, or in the case of the U.S. trucks, have been done better and/or before and I have the older sets. When I saw the tractor was released, especially using the lime green colour found on Claas (my favourite) products, I was inspired enough to get it from my local Lego store,&nbsp;spending enough to get the exclusive Hulk Minifig too.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The set makes up in the usual Technic way, but I have noticed they now seem to favour blue for the connectors rather than the previous black. I decided I preferred the original black ones, and made up the set using old black connectors where I could. I also have a thing about odd or bright colour element combos, but I guess for some people they probably like it. Where possible I replaced the light grey, yellow and lime green elements with the black equivalents to get a more authentic look.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The set has HOG steering via 2 shafts with a roof mounted knob. It also has a rear transmission for implements to be driven as per the real thing (I kept the yellow) element here as it is authentic for a Claas machine. This is driven off the right hand rear wheel via a gear box – and allows what I think is supposed to be a rake/swather or similar to work. The transmission can also authentically be raised and lowered via a screw mechanism behind the cab.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The implement is cleverly made up so that it can be removed from the transmission – so you could also make up MOC implements driven from the transmission – now there is a new line Lego could consider - optional working implements. As I said, I think the implement is supposed to be a rake/swather and when lowered and moving spins around convincingly. When standing, the loose elements on the rakes flop about like&nbsp;flails – especially when the whole thing is raised on the transmission and the sides are also raised up when they hang down. This latter feature disengages the 2 rakes/flails from the drive which continues to turn, so this makes up for the fact that there is no clutch for disengaging the drive, and means you can push it along without the implement spinning.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I enjoyed building this set, and I think it has good playability and is value for money. It could probably be improved with the addition of an engine – which might mean the steering shaft has to be relocated, and the engine would have to be driven too. For now I have not attempted that – mainly because I do not have any spare engine block elements, but, apart from the colour changes (on the implement too), I have added other modifications. It is no longer a pure Technic set as I have added normal elements to provide a fuel tank in front of the steps, a modified exhaust stack and front end and a white cab roof complete with lights at the front and strobe light. I also completely rebuilt the implement, adding&nbsp;some additional red elements and replacing the troublesome flopping flails with smaller 3 blade propellors to look more like rotary&nbsp;rakes. I also added some wheels&nbsp;for it to rest/run on&nbsp;either side.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The authentic Claas look has been finished off with MOC stickers and the addition of red wheels – the rear pair having to be painted to match the front ones from the spares box – it’s a pity Lego didn’t do the wheels in red in the first place, as so far as I know the large rear ones only come in grey. If you want a look at the finished article - check out my Brickshelf page or just search set 9393.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Overall, a very good set – a worthy subject, enjoyable build, good working features/playability all at a good price. As we are currently hosting the Olympic Games, it merits&nbsp;a gold medal.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>
 Technic brought me out of my dark ages (Air Tech Claw Rig in 1995) and I&#39;ve bought most of the large sets that have been released since. I&#39;m not much of a fan of super cars and other &#39;street&#39; vehicles but I do like a good digger or other utility vehicle, so this tractor is right up my street.</p>
<p>
 There have been loads of Technic tractors over the years (See this <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/bricklists/?5522"">Bricklist by duq</a>) and in fact one of the first &#39;Technical sets&#39; ever released was a tractor, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=851-1"" title=""View set details"">851</a> in 1977.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/7837691304/"" title=""9393 Tractor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""9393 Tractor"" height=""211"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7837691304_486764b0ae_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; float: right;"" width=""240"" /></a> This latest one, like most recent ones, is lime green and is fitted with a farming attachment (that I&#39;d name if I knew what it was called) that can be raised and folded in when not in use. It can also be detached completely.</p>
<p>
 I find it interesting how the Technic design team make something look a particular colour but actually use very few pieces in the colour, and it&#39;s certainly the case here. Out of the 350 pieces, only 10 are lime green!</p>
<p>
 If you&#39;ve never built a Technic set before this is a good introduction: there are not too many pieces so it only takes an hour or so to construct, yet it packs in enough &#39;technical&#39; functions to make it interesting to build and play with.</p>
<p>
 Being a new release, it hasn&#39;t been discounted much yet, although it is currently 20% off at Amazon.de, according to the<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/buy/amazon/""> Amazon price comparator</a>. At shop.LEGO.com it&#39;s priced at <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=oSv/vWYkQIY&amp;offerid=115554.9393&amp;type=15&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.lego.com%2Fen-US%2FTractor-9393"">$39.99 in the USA</a>, <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=oSv/vWYkQIY&amp;offerid=124738.9393&amp;type=15&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.lego.com%2Fen-GB%2FTractor-9393"">&pound;24.99 in the UK</a>,&nbsp; and <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=oSv/vWYkQIY&amp;offerid=208931.9393&amp;type=15&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.lego.com%2Fen-CA%2FTractor-9393"">$49.99 in Canada</a>&nbsp;so for once we Brits are not being ripped off: the current &pound;:$ exchange rate of 1:1.57 has been honoured almost exactly.</p>
<p>
 A great introduction to Technic and a good looking model that&#39;s fun to play with: highly recommended :-)</p>

"SenatorBlutarsky","2012-10-26T12:00:14.38Z","Perhaps the best Technic set ever with fewer than 400 pieces","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is an excellent addition to the Technic theme.&nbsp; Although there have been numerous Technic tractors in the past, this one seems to fill a niche that hasn't been addressed by an existing set, at least not in a long time.&nbsp; In terms of complexity, features, and price, this set sits directly in between the mini-Technic tractors (8281, 8260)&nbsp;and the large Technic tractors (8284, 8063).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building this set took a little more than an hour, and it was a pretty enjoyable experience.&nbsp; It is clear that a lot of thought went into both the mechanical and the aesthetic details of the model.&nbsp; I often judge the building experience by how many ""surprises"" there are,&nbsp;where a ""surprise"" is a sub-assembly whose purpose is not immediately obvious, at least not until I get close to the end of the build. &nbsp;Even though the part count of this model is fairly low, I found that there were&nbsp;a few surprises, including&nbsp;the mechanism that&nbsp;holds the mower/flail blades down in the deployed position&nbsp;-- simple but ingenius!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are done with the build, you end up with a really nice looking tractor that has an impressive set of features for its size.&nbsp; Careful attention to details is evident in the design of the model.&nbsp; The panels and wheelguards are seamlessly&nbsp;integrated in the body, and the use of clear Bionicle teeth for the headlights is absolutely inspired -- they're a perfect fit.&nbsp; I also like the relatively authentic-looking exhaust stack and front counterweight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are four functional features in this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tractor is steered via HOG gear-knob on top of the cab. 
<li>The mower/flail implement is driven off of one of the rear wheels (in a model of this size, there is no way to fit in a differential so that both rear wheels can drive the PTO axle). 
<li>The mower/flail implement may be raised/lowered via a knob located behind the cab. 
<li>The individual mower/flail disks may be folded up/down.&nbsp; When they are in the up position, they are disconnected from the PTO drive axle (which, as another reviewer points out, mitigates the lack of a clutch mechanism, such as the one found in the 8284 and 8063 models).&nbsp; When the the disks are moved to the down (deployed) position, their gears enage the PTO and the flails spin.&nbsp; The flails are locked in the down position by a clever latching mechanism, which guarantees that the gears remain fully meshed when the flails are deployed (i.e. the gears don't skip).</li></ul>
<p>All of these functions work flawlessly.&nbsp; The mechanical design of the implement is just brilliant -- it packs a ton of functionality into a fairly small package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of this model is great, too.&nbsp; Though it lacks the dummy engine, pendular front suspension, and clutch-driven PTO of the large tractor models, it is a huge step up from the mini-Technic tractors, which generally only have one function.&nbsp; This tractor is rock solid and there are no problems getting all of its functions to work exactly as they are supposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly unique in the parts inventory, but you do get a few nice parts, like the lime green panels and the universal joint.&nbsp; For the price, I'd say the parts are pretty much what you'd expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I have to give the 9393 tractor a very positive review.&nbsp; I can't think of any other Technic sets in this price/piece count range that deliver as much satisfaction (though the 8051 Motorbike is a close runner-up).&nbsp; It's definitely worth a look, regardless of whether you are new to Technic or are a seasoned Technic veteran.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
