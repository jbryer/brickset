"just2good","2012-07-18T20:50:40.243Z","The Ultimate Spider-Man set! Literally!","Hello, Missingno here (or 'just2good' on other LEGO sites). Today I will be reviewing the new <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Marvel Super Heroes</span> set I ordered from Walmart.com last week (and received it today, July 18th 2012) called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Spider-Man's Doc Ock Ambush</span>. It is set number 6873, retails for $30 USD and contains 295 pieces.<br><br>For starters, the building experience went quick as it only took around 30 minutes. There wasn't much repetition during the build, which is a plus for me. The set does include 7 stickers (I think) and the worst part during the build was applying two of the stickers to <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=85984"">two black 1x2 cheese slopes</a>. <br><br>The pieces in this set are great. So much sky blue (or some type of blue color)! Notable examples: <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=87926"">two sky blue (?) half cylinder</a>, <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=54200"">lots of sky blue (?) cheese slopes</a> and <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2450"">two sky blue 3x3 cut corner wedges</a>, just to name a few. The figures are also great! Spidey has back torso and head printing, Doc-Ock has Snape's 2010 hair piece with a great double sided face and torso back printing while Iron Fist has front head printing and back torso printing. Sadly, none of the figures have any leg printings (despite a cartoony picture of Spidey from the end of the instructions, which has arm and leg printing).<br><br>The playability features on this set are lacking. There isn't much to play with here, besides the awesome figures, some flick-and-fire missiles and solid structure. There are two lame features- one in which you can move an air vent up and down and one where you can move a cover up and down.<br><br>Lastly, like the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Helicarrier</span> set, the build is split in to parts (3 segments to be exact) and each part is connected by connector pieces (also like the Helicarrier). The build is stern and will not break when the segments are split apart (unlike the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Vampyre Castle</span> set).<br><br>This set is great, but I would buy the Wolverine set first since the Wolverine set is cheaper by $10 USD and includes 3 exclusive figures (just like this set). But still, the pieces in this set are great and the same goes for the $30 USD price point.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">9/10<br><br></span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vvIrhTZEa4"">Watch my video review of this set on YouTube by clicking here, which is more hands on and has more details about the set.</a><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"Tyrell_Archer","2012-07-28T18:15:16.257Z","Not iconic, but it'll do","<p>With the Marvel Super Heroes sets coming out, I realized what my Lego City was missing: The Avengers. &nbsp;Since I'm a comic reader, my Avengers includes Spider-Man, and after a frustrating waiting period, Ultimate Spider-Man: Doc Ock's Ambush was finally released. &nbsp;Was it worth the wait? &nbsp;A little yes, a little no...</p><p><br></p><p>I would have far preferred a more iconic set - having Doctor Octopus robbing a bank, and Spidey swinging in to save the day, for example. &nbsp;(I know the first movie theme had this, but that was before my ""second wave"" of Lego collecting.) &nbsp;I understand this set is based on the new Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, but since the show is not yet released in Canada I can't say how accurate it is. &nbsp;I do like the idea of Spider-Man sneaking into Doc's secret hideout, and the secret lab is appropriately mad science-y. &nbsp;There are some fun features in this set - an analysis ""pod"", a table with arms to hold a prisoner, etc. &nbsp;The tower seems a little extraneous - it would have been nice to have the tower do something else other than hold a fan, but at least it uses some unique sky blue curved wall pieces. &nbsp;The Spider-Man minifig is almost dead-on, except there are no boots! &nbsp;The inclusion of Iron Fist is a real plus, and he is completely accurate (although an extra head scarf piece might have been nice). &nbsp;The good Doc himself is different than the comics, but I presume he looks like his animated self. &nbsp;The arms are terrific, especially since they can be detached and placed on the little vehicle that comes with it, but I am not thrilled with the claws at the end. &nbsp;I'm planning on replacing these with movable pincers.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, it's a nice set, and the minifigs are a perfect addition to your Marvel collection. &nbsp;While the set itself has some nice play features, I will likely dismantle this and incorporate the components into the Hulk's Helicarrier Breakout set for an ""ultimate"" Helicarrier. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent, mostly accurate minifigs</li><li>Good play features</li><li>Some unique colours</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Some lost or missing opportunities for added play value</li><li>Doc Ock's tentacles need pincers, not just snap ""claws""</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, I can't be disappointed at all - a good little set, and now Spidey can finally join the Avengers. &nbsp;Now, if we can just get Alpha Flight...</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"aerosmithfan101","2012-08-17T13:25:50.293Z","Great addition to the super heroes line-up","<p>I ordered this set a week or two after it's release. I really wanted to go to the store, get this set and have an experience buying it, but since its a LEGO exclusive, I had to compromise and buy it off of their site.</p><p>The set itself is neat. I&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;seen the tv show that this is based off of, so I cant really say its ""relate able"" like the Avengers sets, but it's good.&nbsp;The&nbsp;build was easy, maybe took 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The minifigs, unfortunately, were a bit of a let-down...</p><p>Spider-man: The head's design is awesome, but it isn't too bold. I definitely prefer the older spider-man minifigs to the newest one. The legs are my biggest turn-off. They're just regular blue legs! Since when does spider-man wear jeans on the job? &nbsp; Rating- 4.2/5</p><p>Doc Ock: The new design for the arms are alot more sturdy than the previous ones from the SM2 sets a few years ago. Rating- 4.6/5</p><p>Iron Fist: It's pretty awesome of LEGO to include lesser-known heroes in these sets (Ex:, Deadpool, Iron Fist, Nova, etc.) They did a pretty good job with this one! My only complaint is he should have came with 1X1 circular pieces to put on his hands like Iron Man.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 Iron Fist Minifig</li><li>Pro 2 Its good to have Spider-man back in the line-up</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 The price is a bit high; $25 would have been more appropriate IMO</li><li>Con 2 The&nbsp;Spider-man&nbsp;minifig is a bit&nbsp;disappointing</li></ul>

"mossman32","2013-05-13T09:41:49.153Z","Spider Man and Iron Fist ","I am not a big fan of Doctor Octopus. However, this set is really fun to build and i enjoy Spider Man and Iron Fist. The lab setting is pretty unique, but Doctor Octopus is the only problem i have with it. His ""octopus arms"" if you wanna call them, are extremely annoying and he always falls down when i try to get him to stand up. I've decided to just trade him away.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,5,5,4,4
"Agent_Hugo","2014-06-13T04:30:22.553Z","A widely underrated set","<p>While it isn&#39;t destined to be a classic, Doc Ock Ambush is one of the best sets in the Super Heroes line.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While the set is very strong as-is, it contains a lot of very useful pieces for parts-package buyers. The blue 1x1 cylinders are always welcome, and there are a number of plates and cheese wedges (which are&nbsp;handy for most any type of build). Cones, Technic pieces, black, gray, trans light blue; when it comes to parts, this set has it all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-Man is the same as in any other set.</p>

<p>The Iron Fist figure is a little bland, but he&#39;s still a proud member of&nbsp;my LEGO hero squad.</p>

<p>Dock Ock&#39;s face is&nbsp;a bit creepy, but the gray color scheme and greasy hair work well.</p>

<p>I would have liked a henchman. Easy enough to bring one in from somewhere else, though.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;re used to the layout, the build is on the range of a half-hour; just&nbsp;right for keeping your hands busy while watching something on Netflix. Not&nbsp;particularly easy or difficult, though the water tower requires some thought.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m a fan. The lab is a bit cramped, but the hinges allow it to be opened as wide as needed. The center of the lab looks terrific, with some nice detail by the operating table.</p>

<p>The &#39;car&#39; is a low point, but it has some useful parts. I turned mine into a Google car-type lab robot.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not without its flaws, but this is easily one of my favorite sets in the Super Heroes line. For $30 USD, you can&#39;t go wrong.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-11-22T17:08:38.5Z","NOT a FAN...or AM I???","<p>Hey everybody, Sideswinger here, reviewing the LEGO Spider-Man&#39;s Doc Ock Ambush set. This set was released in 2012, it includes 295 pieces, and it was exclusive to Walmart in the US back in the day. It retailed for 30 dollars in 2012, but it goes for about 56 new nowadays.&nbsp;Anyways, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>So, as hard as it is to imagine, this was the first set to include that Spider-Man minifigure! Even for 2012, I don&#39;t really care for it, as it looks rather immature. The eyes are far too large, and the entire minifigure doesn&#39;t look quite right to me. Aside from Spidey, the set includes Doc-Ock, who was new for&nbsp;this&nbsp;set. I think the design for him is alright, as he does feature some pretty nice&nbsp;torso-detailing. I also love the face, and I love the use of Professor Snape&#39;s hair in dark brown. I would have liked the green design for Doc Ock, but it is what it is. Then lastly, we have Iron Fist, which is a bit of a random inclusion. I&#39;m not complaining, though, as this was also his first appearance in a set. The figure looks good, with that interesting head and torso detail, but I am a bit let down that he includes no power pieces or whatnot. Overall, all 3 characters were exclusive back in the day, so I can&#39;t really complain about it too much. I do wish there were more than three included, though.</p>

<p>Builds:</p>

<p>Alright, so next we have the builds, and this is a typical LEGO playset. It includes a laboratory, a small vehicle, and some tentacles for Doc-Ock. To justify the side builds, I think Doc&#39;s tentacles are actually pretty great, but let&#39;s be honest: that vehicle is pretty terrible. It just looks like wheels with a weird block on top! Also, due to his tentacles, Doc-Ock can&#39;t even sit on it, which sort of defeats its purpose, if you&nbsp;ask me. That big laboratory build, however, is not bad at all. Starting from that small capsule, I like the details on the surface, and that small stickered&nbsp;brick on the front is a nice feature. Moving down to the next segment, we have a small laboratory design, which sort of lacks detail, but it isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world. It has two stickered panels on the sides, and even a big radar dish on top. Of course, that table used to hold Iron Fist is in the centre of, and I absolutely adore those massive cords extending above the whole assembly. Last but not least, we have that large tower build, which is made up of a few sky blue panels that I believe are exclusive to the set. On top, we have that big fan, which offers a fun way for Spider-Man to sneak into the lab.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>The building experience this offers is decent, but it isn&#39;t the best build-up in the world. I do love how the build doesn&#39;t get repetitive, since each segment is very different from each other, and I&#39;ve always enjoyed&nbsp;building small side builds before, or after the main build. So at the end of the day, while it isn&#39;t the best, the build process isn&#39;t terrible.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The playability of this set is pretty fantastic! I can totally see myself creating wild plots and crazy stories with this when I was a kid, and I think I would have crazily enjoyed battling it out with those minifigures.</p>

<p>Final Verdict:</p>

<p>When I started this review, I honestly wasn&#39;t a massive fan of the&nbsp;set. But as I wrote this, I&#39;ve come to realise that it isn&#39;t all too bad. While I wish there were more, I think the minifigures included in the set are pretty cool, and I definitely think the build is super playable. It doesn&#39;t look terrible as a display piece, either. So at the end of the day, I&#39;m actually gonna give this set a 4 out of 5! That is it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
