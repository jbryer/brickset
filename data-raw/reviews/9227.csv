	I got this set at Wal-Mart. I was very excited when I purchased it, mostly fueled by the suspense of waiting for an hour while my mom looked at clothes. I&#39;m one of those kids that builds stuff in the car. (note: Do not try this at home. You will lose pieces, and you&#39;ll get a cramp in your legs from squeezing them together, trying fruitlessly to contain the pieces.) When I got home, I was disappointed to learn that it was nearly unplayable. It sat on the shelf overnight, and here I am now in the morning, writing a review. Here it is!</p>
<h4>

<ul>
	<li>

	<li>
		Really nice parts: Wheels, 2 large breastplate armors, nice Speeda Demon helmet, small, purple Stormer XL drone piece</li>
	<li>
		Two giant &quot;machetes&quot;</li>
	<li>
		Two of Surge&#39;s lightning weapons</li>
</ul>
<h4>

<ul>
	<li>
		Bike parts wobble a lot</li>
	<li>

	<li>
		Rather unplayable</li>
</ul>

	Now, a written review:</p>
<p>
	=The Bike=</p>
<p>
	The bike&#39;s parts are, as I said, rather wobbly. Although, it will not fall apart. Really good &quot;keep together&quot; engineering was employed here. When you push the bike around, the &quot;shredding teeth&quot; on the wheels with catch on the floor, rendering it not good for speeding away from Stormer, who is supposed to &quot;Catch and Cuff&quot; Speeda Demon. The wheels are very good parts for a spinning blade shield, as show by the Stormer &amp; Demon combiner model. There is also a very handy piece that Demon snaps onto, and he will never fall off.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	=Speeda Demon=</p>
<p>
	Speeda Demon is a four armed character. The two &quot;regular&quot; arms in front are you average arms, with larger armor on the shoulders than the forearm. The two rear arms are a shoulder, elbow and wrist deal. They are quite pose able, although I still haven&#39;t figured out a good way to position them. Demon&#39;s small chest plate is surprisingly effective. It is not as skimpy as you&#39;d think, although Breez&#39;s plate would be a welcome change. His armor surprisingly covers ever ball possible. His top leg armor though is unfortunately skimpy. His helmet is a very nice shape for him.</p>
<p>
	=Overall=</p>
<p>
	The set is a good one for the parts. It is a slightly challenging build, especially for Hero Factory. It is not very playable, though. If you&#39;re collecting Hero Factorys, this would be a star set. If you want it for the pieces, it would be alright. If you want it to play with, you may be slightly disappointed. Overall, this is a above average set, but definitely not into the &quot;awesome&quot; level.&nbsp;</p>
