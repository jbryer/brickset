My little builders liked the story and the models, and kept playing with the models, Penny Pilot &amp; Joe Racer,&nbsp;afterward.&nbsp;</p><p>The set's strengths are the two good models (Penny's plane and Joe's car) and the quality book. &nbsp;Penny's plane has two uncommon parts, the&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;engine and the 2x4 underside curved brick. &nbsp;The character face bricks are nicely printed and I might use them for some MOC Thomas the Tank Engine trains. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The 12 page board book is up to Lego's usually high standards -well illustrated, made of quality cardboard and has pretty good rhyming verse. &nbsp;</p><p>Play-ability is quite high for such a small set with its two characters/models and the story is just right for getting play started. &nbsp;</p><p>The only downsides to the set is the high price per brick and perhaps that as a starter set it is a bit limited in the number of bricks - you need more for really creative play.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all a good purchase for preschoolers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,3
