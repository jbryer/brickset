I've been holding out for these booster packs to get some though, as I have no intentions of buying the far overpriced spinners, and most of the sets do not interest me. Today was the first time I saw a booster pack with a snake-fig, so I immediately grabbed it. I was slightly disappointed to discover it was missing one of the purple pieces, but the fig was really all I wanted anyway. Overall, there isn't really much to say about it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1.) The fig (Mezmo) is pretty cool, with his hooded head and red hypnotic eyes.</li><li>2.) Some of the pieces are nice, such as the gold axe blades, and the round 2x2 brick with grooves&nbsp;</li><li>3.) The only part (that I can tell) that is made from a cheaper plastic is the head<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1.) Almost no building at all</li><li>2.) Unless you have a spinner and/or other NinjaGo sets, the parts are pretty much useless outside of MOCing</li></ul>
<p>Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this set unless, like me, you want a cheap-ish way to get your hands on a snake-fig. I wouldn't even recommend buying it for a child, as they will likely get bored with it very quickly.<br></p>",TRUE,2,2,1,1,2
