"BRICKBOY74","2012-05-27T09:20:26.807Z","Mainly for the minifig","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well for the old 2011 spinners this is a okay set. But for thge new (2012, for 2013 readers)&nbsp;Now the spinners are different. They have a coloum going down the center and above the holes for the bottom acsesories. Before it would just decline up. The new spinners are eassier to balance. If you get this booster pack than I hope you have a new spinner (2012). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weapons</strong></p>
<p>The weapons are hard to balance because they are so big.</p>
<p><em>Golden&nbsp;ice whip</em></p>
<p>This is the golden weapon. It is very hard to balance but it might be eassyier in the new spinners. It has a golden fang blade top on a golden chain. The chain is small, but goes really far. For spinjistu players this might not be the best weapon to pick in a battle because the&nbsp;chain will just bend&nbsp;when it hits the other player. It also comes with a rare golden sensi stick. (It is suppose to say Golden Shuriken&nbsp;Whip but who&nbsp;knows how to spell shiriken. To avoid confusion I put ice whip.)&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Diamond Ice Axe</em></p>
<p>I'm going to say the same thing basicly hard to balance. And to balance it barley extends of the spinner. (asuming spinners haven't changed size) It does come with good peices a gray light saber blade and a blue crystall. Also the other piece not sure what to call it so here is a picture <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=92690&amp;colorID=86&amp;in=A"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=92690&amp;colorID=86&amp;in=A</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sensi stick</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I say you get these amazing weapons and then this common one. If your going to give a one peice weapon a leat be and axe or mace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>
<p>This is just zx zane. A better vaulue would be venomari shrine but this is new for summer 2012 and it was the only booster pack there so it isn't that bad. I got this at my walmart with the worst lego selection ever. Hey if you want&nbsp;NRG Jay&nbsp;he is there to. Back to the minifig. The back printing is nice and so is the leg printing. One little thing, the brown string you can see on the back of the legs when he sits down. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other acsesories.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Spikes for bottom of the spinner</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a 2012 spinner I would really like these but I don't so i have no use for these. I hope to get Spitta's spinner but it probaly won't happen. Not much to say so let's move on.</p>
<p><em>Black Ice Sheild</em></p>
<p>I am only calling them that because the card says that. While not much to say either. You get the lined bricks. (Verticle on one side horizontal on the other.) You do get golden peice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Spinner riser</em></p>
