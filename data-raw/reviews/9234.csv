"AddictedToStyrene","2012-09-13T01:28:30.383Z","Great printed figure but slightly sloppy paintjob on the head","<p>Lizaru is another booster pack for Ninjago. Like other boosters, this set contains:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;a figure with a nicely moulded 'snake' headpiece</p>
<p>- plenty of weapons and spare pieces</p>
<p>- three pieces for attachment underneath the spinners that come with 2012 Ninjago sets</p>
<p>- game cards and special rules.</p>
<p>Also like the other booster sets, this figure does not have a spinner itself, which keeps the price down. The weapon selection is good:&nbsp;pearl gold pieces to make a nastly looking axe, as well as an ordinary axe and a 'morning star'. There are two bright green 'dinosaur' tails, and two 1x1 green bricks with side studs, and a single 2 x 2 light bluish grey round brick in the Greek column style. The set also has three transparent neon yellow 'snake' pieces with holes for technic pegs, and dark bluish grey 1.5 length pegs to attach them&nbsp;underneath a Ninjago Spinner.</p>
<p>The figure is very nicely printed with scales on the front and back of the torso, and the front of the legs. The head is a nice mould of a big eyed snake, but the paintjob was slightly sloppy compared to other Lego products. Probably won't be noticed by any young owner, though, and no worse than a ton of other toys on the market. </p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"Topcop999","2012-09-21T14:43:46.32Z","Very nice minifig and accessories for a low price!","<p>I was very happy to see this in a local Tesco and straight away bought it and was not displeased one bit!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Epic minifig.</li><li>Nice variety of pieces to add to the 2012 spinners.</li><li>Still includes cards and 3 weapons even for a booster pack.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>If your a&nbsp;perfectionist like me you and you get bad printing on the head&nbsp;it will be displeasing.</li><li>Hard to find - for me that is.</li></ul>
<p>Very good set with lots of nice accessories to add to your spinner or just nice weapons and a minifig for people without a 2012 spinner.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you see this and like the minifig I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;buying it just for that!</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-11-25T11:25:21.06Z","Venomari Warrior","<p>Set #9557 Lizaru: Another great Serpentine Mini-Fig packaged in a Spinner Enhancing Booster Pack.</p>
<p>Lizaru is a member of the Venomari tribe, his Mini-Fig is pretty impressive with a great scaly torso print (double-sided) carrying down to the legs and a fun looking unique head piece that is both menacing and fun looking. He has four fangs, four eyes, a bunch of spiked ridges on his head and a black pattern printed on the top. It can not turn very far though, so try to be careful, due to the nature of the chinese plastics used to make this new head piece I have a noticeable stress mark on his larynx (the front of the neck) from trying to turn his head too far. (The rear v-necked piece hinders mobility.)</p>
<p>Accessories wise he doesn't have much variety, by which I mean he has two different axes and a mace/ball-and-chain weapon. One axe is the standard medium stone gray you find in Castle Theme sets while the other is a buildable golden double-sided axe. One side of which is a standard axe piece the other one of the new Ninjago bladed pieces used as any number of things.</p>
<p>The spinner enhancing parts aren't much, but they are fun looking, you've got two big green snake's tails and three transparent green serpent pieces that plug into the bottom of the spinner, a veritable arsenal of whips for the spinner that can send your Mini-Figs flying.</p>
<p>It also includes the following cards: Lizaru's Character Card, Spit Acid, Boost, Fair Fight and Poison Whips (The spinner boosting card.) Overall I'd have to say its a pretty decent booster pack and one you shouldn't pass up if you're really into the game, or looking to get some of the Ninjago Mini-Figs on a budget.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3

<p>Same faults as Jay ZX accessory pack, along with same greats. Getting Lizaru the Venomari cheap is a plus. Although the parts are more interesting than Jay ZX&#39;s</p>
