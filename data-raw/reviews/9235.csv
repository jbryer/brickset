"AddictedToStyrene","2012-09-13T01:34:36.9Z","Nasty, brutish and short. ","<p>Bytar is another booster pack for Ninjago. Like other boosters, this set contains:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;a figure with a nicely moulded 'snake' headpiece</p>
<p>- plenty of weapons and spare pieces</p>
<p>- three pieces for attachment underneath the spinners that come with 2012 Ninjago sets</p>
<p>- game cards and special rules.</p>
<p>Also like the other booster sets, this figure does not have a spinner itself, which keeps the price down. The weapon selection here includes pieces for a purple bladed double axe thing and a dark bluish grey scythe blade. Bytar also has a pearl gold cobra piece (the style that sits upright on a single stud).</p>
<p>There are two dark brown 1 x 2 x 2 60 degree slope bricks, and some 1 x 1 brown 'cheese wedges', and a single&nbsp;2 x 2 light bluish grey round brick in the Greek column style. There are also three short black chains and blue half length technic pegs to attach&nbsp;them underneath a Ninjago Spinner.</p>
<p>The figure is a black torso and black short legs. The torso has an orange design printed on the front, and the head piece is very impressive. It is better than it looks on the packaging, with a nasty fanged grin and 13 spikes picked out in orange. If anyone wants evil aliens or henchmen for their Lego armies, this is the figure to pick up!</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4

Sadly from my experience it would appear that he isn't as popular as other characters, as he is the one who is in abudance everywhere and I can't fathom why.</p>
<p>Bytar is a great looking Mini-Figure, he has short legs which I was not expecting and a double-sided torso print revealing his scaly hide as well as a unique looking head piece. Covered in spikes and with a pair of protruding fangs, Bytar looks like a menacing creature. Something you might come across in Star Wars or something, and yet he's an original LEGO Character. I really dig the look of this little dude.</p>
<p>Being that this is a Booster Pack it is primarily used to boost Spinners with extra add-on pieces. There are three whip-like chains for the underside of the spinner, two short sloping protective barriers and the piece used to make the spinner taller. Now that I actually have a spinner (or two) I can safely say these Booster Packs deliver on all fronts.</p>
<p>Accessory wise Bytar comes with a Scimitar Sword, a Double-Bladed Sword (which looks more like a big pike or something, but that's what the Character Encyclopedia calls it.) and a Gold Viper. A nasty looking little creature that I'm not sure if its meant to be a weapon or a living creature.</p>
<p>Lastly he comes with five cards, Bytar's Character Card, Ground Attack, Chain Strike, Crown of Earth and Earth Bound. Again I'm not 100% sure what card means what for the game, however I'm still intrigued enough to say they're pretty impressive looking. Overall I'd have to say, that for the price they are asking Booster Packs are either a good thing or a bad thing, they're great to enhance your existing spinners. If you don't collect the spinners and don't have any sets with spinners included they are kind of pointless unless you really want Bytar's MF and can't find or afford the larger sets he's included in. Still I feel it's worth picking up.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,2,4
