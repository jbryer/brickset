(sage &amp; prince)&nbsp; Ilrion comes with a king microfig who is just waiting to be rescued. New potion of defense&nbsp;introduced.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul><li>Giant bat to fight</li><li>New heros</li><li>New potions</li><li>Looks great</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>5 coffins 4 bats</li><li>Prince special ability too similar to knights</li><li>No weapon to buy for sages special ability</li><li>No treasure chest</li><li>Another sorcerer</li></ul>
<p>If you like Heroica this is a good addition.&nbsp; The giant vampire bat is the best part of Ilrion.&nbsp; Nothing like an epic battle against a giant monster.&nbsp;The lack of bats to go along with the coffins&nbsp;was dissapointing.&nbsp; Not the best of the heroica expansions but still fun and worth getting.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"BubblesMaster","2012-12-12T12:27:49.35Z","Best Heroica Game Yet! With a few downsides though...","<p>&nbsp;I bought this set from target and I don't regret it! I love Heroica, and I hope this isn't the last set. Despite having awesome pieces and microfigs, this set does have some downsides.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 2 new heroes! (See Cons 1 and 2)</li><li>Pro 2 The microfigs are very well done.</li><li>Pro 3 Giant bat.</li><li>Pro 4 Comes with new boss rules.</li><li>Pro 5 The S1 monsters, the traps, and treasure boxes were all combined to make coffins. (See Con 3)</li><li>Pro 5 New potion, and it comes with 2!</li><li>Pro 6 ZOMBIES!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 2 new heroes! But no weapons to go with them. &nbsp;</li><li>Con 2 The prince's power is just the knight's power in reverse.</li><li>Con 3 The S1 monsters, the traps, and the treasure boxes were combined to make coffins, cool idea, but fewer pieces then other sets and you have to add bats from Nathuz to have a&nbsp;permanent&nbsp;S1 monster.</li><li>Con 4 Fewer pieces.</li><li>Con 5 The same old fighting system, it's getting kinda old.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Overall, a very good set that's worth the money. Although it has a lot of Cons, I would buy it as many times possible to expand my Heroica collection.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
