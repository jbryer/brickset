if you plan to get it, watch out the sticker sheet is included, again providing you (only) with town-related adhesives.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"desser1","2010-09-03T05:24:50.627Z","Creativity Booster","<p>This book was great and helped me a lot as a little boy seeing that there's more to every Lego set then only the main model. I tried many&nbsp;of the models shown there or using as a starting point for own designs. The models given cover almost the whole Lego range back then (except Duplo, Fabuland and Technic) with nice basic models, a lot of town ideas (with a nice sticker set in the middle) and very nice space and castle theme sugestions. the last two of those were quiet frustrating, because they also showed some fantastic, very large models I knew, I would never be able to built. The last page shows ideas for motorised models.<br />
This books gives hours of nice building experience for little money and provides nice stickers (for town models only).<br />
