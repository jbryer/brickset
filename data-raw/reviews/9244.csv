Although its kind of small, its a great set to buy. This is because it contains alot of useful pieces for your city and it contains a engine like the one in the 4641 Speed Boat. A forest policeman is included in this set. One thing I dont like is that there is a gap between the head and the body because of the lifejacket.<div><br></div><div>Overall, a great set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Ernst","2012-03-11T06:21:33.46Z","Police boat with LEGO activity book.","<p>Overall 5 bricks : I got this polybagged set in combination with a LEGO activity book for children, so a nice buy. The set is a good one containing a speedboat with outboard engine (the fist I saw) and a minifigure of the new forest police. Both the single set and certainly in combination with the book are worth 5 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : not too difficult but fun to do. The boat is mostly made of plates and inverted slopes and gives a nice result. Nice detail is the outboard engine which was new to me but probably was used before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : a lot of usefull parts in this small set with a great new forest police minifigure. Great uniform and a great hat !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : the set itself has not very much possibilities, it needs a least one bad guy.Set can be used both with the normal Police and Harbour sets and of course the new Forest Police.&nbsp;With the book it came with of course 5 bricks so I come to an average of 4 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : the price I paid was €4,99 which is for the single set already a nice deal but combined with the book very good so 5 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book contains all kind of nice games and quizes so this gives every kid a great time. I will try to edit this review later with a picture of the frontside of the book to complete this review.</p>

"MovieNerd","2012-03-26T02:21:37.03Z","This Life Jacket is one of the worst pieces I've ever seen...","<p>A pretty standard boat set that comes with one of the new excellent forest police minifigs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PROS:</p><p>1. The cop has really detailed torso. I really like the walkie talkie print&nbsp;that is on the front and down his back too. I'm also a fan of his hat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. A printed Police tile. I don't really mind stickers, but I'm still glad whenever they use printed tiles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CONS:</p><p>1. The life jackect is pure junk. It makes the head rest far too high up&nbsp;on the neck and just looks stupid. I'm surprised LEGO approved this. I had to take it off of him, because it just didn't look good and it covered up his cool torso anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. The motor rests just a tad to far away from the boat. This is something easily fixed if you have the right extra pieces though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All and all I like the set,&nbsp; but I do really wish LEGO had come up with something better for the life jacket. I really amazed they thought that looked good. However kids won't care about these problems too much and adult collectors can easily fix what is wrong with it. I'd say it's worth picking up if you're a POLICE fan.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:34:12.44Z","Fun and Enjoyable Polybag.","<p><strong>Set #30017 Police Boat: </strong>This is a fun little companion set for the Forest Police sub-theme from LEGO City, let&rsquo;s go over all of the pros and cons and then give final thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is great, it&rsquo;s a little motorboat you&rsquo;d see in parks and forests on the river, includes a printed 1x2 tile with the Police logo on it, and the motor is a fun little build.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Police Officer Minifigure is great, fairly standard from this range, but he includes the larger ranger hat which makes this the cheapest method of picking it up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece ratio was great back when originally released.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No real accessories for the Minifigure, and I&rsquo;m still not a fan of that new life vest piece LEGO insists on using, it fails to sit properly on Minifigures.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Track this down if you don&rsquo;t already own it, I really think this is a great looking Polybag and the fact you get the new ranger hat in such a cheap set is great. The model is very fun to build and play with too for the younger fans.</p>
