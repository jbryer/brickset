<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No box, because it's a polybag set with the picture above on it. The instuctions are on a small folded paper.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing intresting-there are ""classic"" and special pieces too- except for the propeller part which is quite new for me. 32 pieces + 5(!) extras is pretty much compairing to other polybags.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>It contains one minifig-a new forest police pilot, so if you own this set, you don't have to buy that big Chinook or the forest police station to have a minifig like this. He has got a map on his leg(?), many pockets, a light greenish badge aaaaaaaaaaaaaand-printed back!<br><h4>The build</h4>Nothing special, it takes ~2 minutes to build.<br><h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is a bit unrealistic, bit weird, but cool. Sirens, red and green lights, propeller, so it has got everything what a real-life microlight has.<h4>Summary</h4>~6,69 $ is a very bad price for a small stuff like this, so wait until it will be underpriced if you like to buy it. Almost perfect for any cities with forest or without forest. Neat!<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The instructions are simple and are printed on a single sheet, double sided.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>Nothing special with the parts.&nbsp; I did find it nice to see the policeman was in a blue flight suit, but outside of that the parts are probably the same ones you already have and can build without purchasing the set.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>One minifig - the policeman. As mentioned above it was nice to see the policeman in a blue flight suit. Both torso and legs are printed</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>Easy and simple, what you&#39;d expect with a polybag.&nbsp; My&nbsp;4 year old son had it complete in about 5 minutes with help showing him where pieces go.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>It&#39;s awkward but fits with all of the other microlights LEGO has put out over the years. The construction is better than set 1959 (the other microlight I own) but not by much. In the end, its a cheap set meant for kids at the checkout line. It isn&#39;t realistic at all and while that&#39;s annoying to us AFOLs, young kids love it.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Bought the set for my son for an Easter basket - it was cheap, small&nbsp;and simple so it was a perfect set for an Easter basket. He loves and the playability factor is good for him as it flies - anything that flies is good playability for a 4 year old. At 32 pieces the piece count was of course low and thus the pieces/dollar was higher but the price isn&#39;t anything to go bananas about in most cases.</p>

A gyrocopter would be highly desirable as a set one day. The engine is where the small propeller fits in to the back under a tiny white tail. This covers the police sign on top of two wings with the excellent red and green wing lights for safety and to remind the dizzy pilot which is starboard and port side, right and left.</div><div><br></div><div>The set design obsession with one stud slopes continues with the blue lights so that it can attempt to pursue... anything? It just looks so shaky. A large front slope would have improved the nose and a more encompassing cockpit area but for a promoted or free item, this may have been limiting. The mini figure is actually totally unnecessary and not that good apart from the trousers. In future polybags would be preferable without them where a better vehicle or set could have been made with the budget or brick count.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Special Police</b></div><div>The over excited police pilot looks a bit 'special', grinning in the orange goggles but is fitting enough.&nbsp;A fun little flyer for the children that is otherwise not Lego's best but can probably be made in to something better or stripped for the parts.</div></div>",TRUE,2,4,2,3,5
