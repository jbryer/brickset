I grew up with one such set, owned it in fact, the name escapes me at the moment but you'll find a review of it from me here. This isn't much of a set honestly, and perhaps the veils of nostalgia cloud my vision, but I still think it's a neat little Polybag.</p>
<p>The model uses a new style of build compared to how classic LEGO Race Cars were built in the 80's. This is because there are now new pieces being offered up, back in the 80's we didn't have the 'Cheese' Slope or the Tire Rim curved piece that is included with this set, I'm probably mangling the term for the piece, however it does have a unique look to it. This model is pure fun, it's a quick and easy build, with very few unique parts, but the hours of fun you can get out of it are just that good. It rolls nicely, it works as a swift race car, use it with any of your other City or Racing Themed sets and it'll be a fun toy to play with for the younger crowd.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a standard City Mini-Fig, he's dressed in the red space jacket with single-sided torso print, his legs are plain red, no printing, his face isn't even that unique and the helmet is just that. A blue helmet with transparent visor, which you recieve one spare one in the set. Overall he doesn't seem like much, but he's still well suited for this Polybag set, although you may wish to use the CMF Race Car Driver just to see the difference he can provide for the overall look of the model.</p>
<p>I think this set is a good value for your money, it might not amount to much, but it's a classic LEGO build with classic LEGO techniques, using the more recent parts to make this Racing Car stand out as a nostalgic look back at the past while keeping in mind the techniques of the future. Perhaps that sounds a bit philosophical for you, so I'll sum it up in one simple sentence. Very highly recommended as a set that embodies what LEGO is meant to be, fun, fast and not so furious.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"redbeardlegoman","2013-02-24T14:27:59.2Z","The Natural Evolution of 1088","<p>In another review, 1088 - Road Burner, I praised the economic use of a few parts to make a great little racing car. &nbsp;This is another in the same vein. &nbsp;There are new parts available that add a more streamlined look to this racer than were available in 1999. &nbsp;Such is the nature of technology. &nbsp;As more options become available, more applications are found for them. &nbsp;And with few parts, there are nice details to be had.<br><br>This set, too, can be easily modified, or remade in various colours, to give you an entire field of competitors in a race, at a low price. &nbsp;The parts are all fairly standard, with the mudguard being the one with the least availability of colours (but still with many options).</p><p>The set also comes with a generic minifigure in the Space jacket. &nbsp;That's great, because it's not a special minifigure that will drive up prices in the future.</p><p>I thought I had a con, but the previous statement about the minifigure makes it somewhat contradictory. &nbsp;I had wished that the slope could have been numbered, like that of the Road Burner. &nbsp;Printed with a different number. &nbsp;6 or 7, or some other number that is not already available. &nbsp;However, that would cause the prices to increase markedly with time, thereby negating the pro of the generic minifigure. &nbsp;I'll call it a half-con, and let you decide for yourselves whether or not you agree.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Sweet little racer, and heir to a long tradition of Lego race cars.</li><li>Economic use of few parts for good overall look.</li><li>Cheap to buy mulitple copies of, to modify, or to rebuild in different colour schemes.</li><li>Generic minifigure won't drive up prices in the future.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>(Maybe) It could use a new number print on the slope.</li></ul>
<p>Seriously, how can you leave this little set sitting sadly on the toy store pegboard? &nbsp;You know it will fit right into your city.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
