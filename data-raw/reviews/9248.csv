A practice we older LEGO fans have gotten used to when we collect these hard-to-find or desireable gems. That's why this set is a slight step down from Stephanie's Mailbox when it comes to overall value, however it is still worth looking into.</p>
<p>This polybag's claim to fame is that our Friends Mini-Doll (From here on referred to as Mia for convience sake) Mia has a skateboard. That's it. Don't get me wrong it's a nice looking skateboard in a solid blue color (Thank you for not making it Pink LEGO, that would have just looked silly... Although it might have made a nice MOC for BttF enthusiasts.) and the rest of the pieces are used to pad out the set.</p>
<p>Your daughter will be building a small piece of sidewalk with... Well I have no idea what it is to be honest, I mean it looks like a table, obviously, but what is up with the clear yellow cylinder and topper piece? Some claim it's some sort of street lamp or something, I find that hard to believe. For now we'll simply call it a mystery item and leave it at that. You also get a small planter for the side of the road, this piece is not attached to the small sidewalk piece, it's a seperate item. And like with all Friends sets you get spare flowers and stems, not quite enough to make two, but close enough.</p>
<p>Overall this set is, a bit on the expensive side for what you get. True there is the rare new ice-cream piece for Mia to hold in a clear glass as a Sunday, so that is kind of neat. And the sidewalk includes a fire hydrant, MOCers are going to have loads of fun incorporating this tiny piece of sidewalk into a much larger model. However there aren't as many rare colors or pieces with this set, so paying full price is asking a bit much in my honest opinion. The solid blue skateboard is a great piece though, and Mia the Mini-Doll is also a nice looking figure. This same version of Mia is included in two other boxed sets and the new Brickmaster Friends book, she's good for swapping bodies around though with your other Friends Mini-Dolls. I'd say if you can get this on sale or part of a deal go for it, even paying full price isn't as bad as all that, still many young girls will want to have a bit more than just what this set let's them build and Mia.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
