<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- Comes with Emma and car</li><li>- Feet lock inside car</li><li>- Hubs with rims</li><li>- Realistic look for simple design</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- No steering wheel</li><li>- No bows or hair accessories</li><li>- Smooth 1x2 tile or slope for ""trunk"" would have been nice.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is a GREAT buy in the Friends line, if you can find it. With very slight modifications, it could also be used for a girl car in Lego City. &nbsp;Due to its compact size, it would also work well for Lego Creator homes.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>This set includes 32 pieces and the Emma Mini-Doll, I've gotten five Friends sets so far and I must admit that the Mini-Doll design is just as fun and clever looking as the standard Mini-Figure. There is a lot of great detailing and printing used with Emma, from her molded skirt to the print work chosen for the style of shoes she's wearing. Also her shirt which is a standard looking tee with some plant themed pattern on her stomach. Indeed about the only thing dissapointing with the Mini-Doll design is the fact that they reuse the exact same coloring when swapping legs with other characters. (Aside from the fact that their wrists do not turn.)</p>
<p>The model is simple and involves a lot of white with some teale, pink and purple parts thrown in&nbsp;to add a splash of color. The car itself is, as the title implies, a doll's car. It does not include a steering wheel, it does feature that clever new piece for snapping your Mini-Dolls in snuggly when sitting in a vehicle, however this car isn't one you'd see driving around in your real neighbourhood. I'm not sure on this, but I do believe the hubcap piese are new too, at least I haven't seen them before. (Or if I have I've forgetten about it.)</p>
<p>Overall though this Polybag is really quite impressive and a great little stocking stuffer for your daughter, AFOL Friends Collector or Polybag Enthusiast.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
