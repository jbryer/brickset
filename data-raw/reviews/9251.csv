I can't recall the precise wording, however I may have stated that I would not be picking any of the sets up. (Simply because of other interests I have.) That being said, I suddenly had this huge urge to hunt down as many Polybagged Sets as I could recently and now I'm really interested in certain key sets from the Friends Theme.</p>
<p>However you're here to hear about the Mailbox set, so let's get on with that. 41 Pieces is a fairly decent amount for a Polybagged set, included in the bag are enough parts to build two small models and the usual extra items such as 1x1 studs, a spare flower stem and two spare flower petals.</p>
<p>The primary model is a small red mailbox sitting on a green post with pink sloped pieces for the top, a fairly standard design really with perhaps a few rare colored pieces. I'm not sure I've seen that color of green used before for the post piece and I know that the pink is new.</p>
<p>Your second model is a pretty cleverly built flower and covered chocolate selling stand, I've heard this set is meant to be considered a seasonal Valentines' Day set, I can beleive it. The stand has a large heart on the top of it, built quite cleverly actually using two red...I'm not sure of what most AFOLS call the piece, however they are fairly common.</p>
<p>The colors of the stand are primarily white, with some special and rare pink colored pieces, plus a pair of golden colored spyglasses from the Pirates theme used to hold up the sign/roof of the stand.</p>
<p>Now to cover the final item you get in this set, an item that has caused no end of controversy amongst LEGO Collectors of all ages, the Mini-Fig... Er... Mini-Doll, known as Stephanie. Mini-Dolls were created to represent a new style of play with LEGO, and to draw in the crowd of pre-teen girls who ordinarly aren't interested in LEGO sets of ordinary themes. They are built differently, feature different design and height even from the regular Mini-Fig and. At the same time offer up a lot of great sculpting elements in the overall look of the Mini-Doll.</p>
<p>I did not hate them when they were first shown, far from it I thought they were an interesting take on the Mini-Figure design choice for a girl's Themed set. They remind me quite a bit of Poly Pockets in the overall design, from the fact that they are sculpted a certain way and don't 'lock-in' when sitting down like with traditional Mini-Figs. The key difference here is that LEGO has engineered them to fit in and work alongside ordinary LEGO sets and accessories.<br/>The heads have a similar design with the same head-stud for hat, hair and other accessoires. Their hands can hold any type of LEGO accessory, and their feet have holes for locking in place on any baseplate or other LEGO brick item.</p>
<p>All-in-all the LEGO Mini-Doll is a great attempt by LEGO to reach out and tap into a market that they are obviously not 100% attracting. Stephanie has a great looking facial design that truly resembles a miniature doll, she has a slightly softer blonde hair piece, some impressive detail in print and sculpting and is carrying a piece of mail. Overall, I applaud LEGO's design team, and I'm looking forward to getting more of the Friends Theme sets for my personal collection of Mini-Figs. It isn't completely perfect, I'd kind of wish their wrists turned like on traditional Mini-Figs, because if they're holding something like an ice-cream sunday they can't hold it like they are eating it. However I see nothing wrong with having a bit of variety in a combined LEGO collection of multiple Themes, variety as they say is the spice of life.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this little set is a great set to own, if you're an AFOL (who is male) like me you might be a bit leery of getting sets with so much pink in them. I don't associate Pink as primarly just for girls though, its a new color to introduce amongst the other themes for a broader, better looking assortment of sets and models. If you're a young girl who is the target audience of the Friends line, you'll definitely enjoy this set, however you might want more for Stephanie to interact with than just her mailbox and a choclate selling stand. So beg for your parents to get you a lot more sets to compliment this little thing and play to your hearts content.<br/>The fact that it also includes enough to almost make two bouquets instead of just one, piece wise, is also a nice touch. And I'm certain with enough Friends sets in your collection you'll have more than enough spare petals/flowers to spread amongst all the extra stems you'll have. Good job LEGO, you've managed to convert another supporter of this hot selling Theme to grab a few for his personal collection.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3

<p>&nbsp;I have no idea why it&#39;s called mailbox because the shop is bigger &amp; just a bit better than the mailbox.</p>

<p>My sister got this in the daily mail promotion without even buying it we also got two lone ranger pump cars and two mini headhunters, Plus my sister HATES friends &amp; so do I but not as much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pro 1 Obscure parts (But there&#39;s a con about them too that you&#39;ll see in con 1)</li>
	<li>Pro 2 Shop</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Con 1 Parts are so obscure there basically unusable.</li>
	<li>Con 2 The minidoll&#39;s legs move together, her wrists aren&#39;t possible &amp; the figure is just ugly.</li>
	<li>Con 3 The mail box&#39;s colours are all over the place.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would not recommend this set to anyone who is not a friends fan, I have no idea why people like this theme it just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>
