This little polybag set is one of six polybagged sets from the Friends line, LEGO has made each and every one of them (with possible exception to Stephanie) with careful thinking and foresight. And with great parts.</p>
<p>This is Olivia's Desk, as Olivia is the Mini-Doll included with it. Perhaps she keeps this desk in her room where she can plan out what she's going to do before going down to her Invention Workshop. The desk itself is a straight forward looking model, using ten of the included 26 pieces to make it, it uses a lot of familiar looking parts, but to great effect. The smooth looking top piece is connected to two rose colored sloped bridges and four teale colored rolls, with four pink studs making up the rest of the legs. It is a clever looking build, with some great parts for MOCing.</p>
<p>On top of the desk sits a rose colored mug, a gold lamp with transparent pink dish and yellow stud and a vase of yellow flowers. The vase is one of the best parts, it is a transparent mini-figure head, a piece we rarely get in clear plastic. This is only the second one I've ever owned, the first being the crystal ball with the Witch from Fright Knights, which I sadly lost. (The Rembrall I used to have with my Harry Potter sets had printing on it so it wasn't 100% transparent.)</p>
<p>With two simple pieces, one lime green the other white, you build a stool for Olivia to sit on. And before I forget, the set also includes the new printed tile for Olivia's Ipod, or Iphone, whatever it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>The Mini-Doll is a mix of parts, they are different from the Olivia seen in the Invention Workshop, here she's dressed in a dark rose top with the heart patterns seen on other Olivia Mini-Dolls, plus a light purple skirt and pink shoes. I prefer the look of this version over the other, because at least this one doesn't look like she raided her Friends closet for clothes.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one of the much better polybags out there from the Friends line to date. You get a smattering of useful parts in unique colors, some parts like the computer and Ipod printed tile are offered cheaply and the Mini-Doll really stands out as cute and impressive. You can't go wrong, either, with that transparent Mini-Fig head, and as always it includes an extra stem so you can start building up loads of extra flowers for your garden. I can't reccomend this set enough to fans of Friends, the unique pieces and colors it offers and the Mini-Dolls, in fact I am strongly tempted to grab a second one for the parts alone.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
