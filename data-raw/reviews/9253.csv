"NWB","2012-12-11T19:01:48.967Z","Review #1 30057 Anakin's Pod Racer","<p>Ok, here is my first review, which is of the 30057 Anakin’s Podracer. This 
early 2012 issued set so far has only has been seen at ToysRUs in the 
USA and in the UK. The one I found was in the STAR WARS part of the LEGO
 section and was priced at $4.99 USD each. You can also get it for 
around that same price on Bricklink. You can find catalog entries at 
Brickset: <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=30057-1"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=30057-1</a> and Bricklink: <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=30057-1"" class=""ot-anchor"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=30057-1</a></p><p><br></p><h4>~Packing</h4><p>The
 packing for this set is a vinyl bag featuring of course the set and the
 regular advised age, set name and number of pieces. In the upper right 
hand corner is Darth Maul.</p><p><span></span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8347331995_047a4707cc.jpg[/img]</span></p><h4>~Parts</h4><p>This set contains 38 parts 
19 of them are unique. With a couple of new ones like a 1x2 plate with 1
 stud and groove, and a trans pink light saber blade which has only showed up in a few other sets. Below are photos 
of all the parts and the noted parts.</p><p>4/5</p><p><span></span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8348390684_ed54c20d2c.jpg[/img]</span></p><h4>~Minifigures</h4><p>There are no Minifigures included in this set.</p><p>0/0</p><p><br></p><h4>~Instructions</h4><p>There pretty straight forward&nbsp; there are only 8 steps and like most poly-bags there simple.</p><p><span></span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8348392166_77eb9e6ec4_n.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8080/8348390858_da2cd1e057_n.jpg[/img]</span></p><h4>~The Build</h4><p>The
 build is very simple, as said earlier it only has eight steps to 
complete the build, and only takes a couple of&nbsp; minutes First they have you build the base and the cockpit 
followed by the engines, which includes some Technic building which 
helps for a more accurate end result. When you compare this set (30057) 
with the other mini podracer set that LEGO has made this new one is 
defiantly more superior to the other 2003 version (4485). The '03 
version contains 22 pieces compared to the new pod which has 38 pieces 
in it. A great design for a mini-set, and overall a far improvement to the '03 version.<br></p><p>4/5</p><p><br><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8348391130_195d4fd4a3.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8347333003_559a97abd3.jpg[/img]</span></p><h4>~Playability</h4><p>There is not a ton of playability in this set other that just running around with your unbelievably fast Pod Racer around the house.</p><p>3/5</p><p><br></p><h4>~Conclusion</h4><p>In
 conclusion it is a very good and well designed model especially for 
it’s scale. It is a bit expensive for the 38 pieces at 13.132 cents per 
piece, but still a good model and I would recommend it to any STAR WARS 
fan and also for poly-bag collectors. <br></p><p>4/5</p><p><br><span>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8348391408_8f0441b249.jpg[/img]</span></p><p>Overall: 15/20</p><p><br></p><p>You can also find this review at my Google+ page here:
