<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Somewhat hard to find</li><li>Rear spoilers are long and obtrusive</li><li>Rear spoilers do not mirror larger set</li></ul>

"alexfig8","2013-01-06T15:42:14.147Z","Cool set, kinda like a Tiny Turbo","<p>I think this is a great set. &nbsp;It is kinda rare if you don't live in the US or UK, or if you are don't have a Discovery Center or Target store near you, or if you don't buy The Sun in the UK. &nbsp;I saw this at a Target store in the US and passed. &nbsp;I got it for Christmas that year and was very glad I got it and wished I hadn't passed. &nbsp;Here's Pros/Cons</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Goes well with Tiny Turbos, it has the same wheels and is the same size and scale</li><li>Useful parts, like the black wheel arch things and the flames</li><li>Nice design</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Kinda rare if you don't live in the US or UK</li><li>Like the person above me, I agree that the back doesn't really match the other sets, but it's ok because they don't make mini-scale wings. &nbsp;A new piece for them would be cool though</li></ul><div>So overall, this is a great set, but if you didn't find it and are not that big of a Batman fan or a polybag collector or a Tiny Turbo collector, don't worry about tracking it down.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5

"Edward_Nigma","2018-06-10T04:12:45.737Z","A solid mini-build","<p><em>Retroactive review: I wrote this when I was 14.</em></p>

<p>While I&#39;ve been into Batman LEGO all these years, I&#39;m surprised one of these hadn&#39;t been produced in the Batman theme until 2012 when DC Super Heroes was released. This is an excellent polybag.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Set:</b>&nbsp;30161 Batmobile</li>
	<li><b>Theme:</b>&nbsp;DC Comics Super Heroes</li>
	<li><b>Pieces:</b>&nbsp;45</li>
	<li><b>Minifigures:</b>&nbsp;N/A</li>
	<li><b>Price:</b>&nbsp;$4.99 (Walmart?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Okay... This is a small set. Real small. Not much to it. It&#39;s a great place to get a classic Castle flame if you need one, and the Racers wheels and tires, but not much more than that, I&#39;m afraid. The build is brilliant though. A great collector&#39;s item, since the Batwing and the Tumbler are polybags now.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is an awesome polybag. I loved it when I bought it, and it was the last one too, it was popular as you can see. Thanks for reading my review!</p>
