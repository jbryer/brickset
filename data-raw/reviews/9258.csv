<p>With 53 pieces you build a tiny little Helicopter, uh so to speak, most of the pieces are in white, black or orange with light gray on top. I'm not precisely sure what style of helicopter LEGO is trying to emulate here, but I do know it is a bit of a chunky looking model. Instead of using more curved pieces this model employs a couple of bricks giving the Helicopter a somewhat ungainly looking chassis.</p>
<p>I have very mixed feelings on this, on the one hand it was a pretty decent model to pick up, the parts aren't too rare, however the colors are nice. On the other, it is a bit lackluster in the design, mostly because it is missing some landing gear, or landing struts really as tires wouldn't be very practical on this model. The smaller tail propellor is a pretty clever looking element, I believe it is a Technic style Steering Wheel, and it attaches to the helicopter model in a neat manner. I think it's pretty nifty, even if this renders that propellor non-functional.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say, as far as polybags go, this is an interesting and fun looking little set, you can spin the main propellor and the orange pieces are, a bit of a rarity, I think this is worth picking up if you like little vehicle models and have an interest in MOCing or Brick Films. It isn't Mini-Figure scaled, but it'd still be useful for filming. Polybag Enthusiasts will not want to pass this up, they're starting to appear in abundance at local Canadian TRUs.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
