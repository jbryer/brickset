	Time for review #3. I found this one at my local Wal-Mart, it was $3.97 USD previously it was only seen in Asia and Canada so it was nice to finally have this show up in the US so you wouldn't have to spend the 20+ dollars for it on Bricklink.</p>
<h4>
	Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>
	For the ""Box"" we have a poly-bag which is your basic setup. On the back of the bag there is a free child ticket to Legoland! It says that the parts were made in the countries where the better Lego elements are produced (Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, and Chech Republic). The instructions are the normal size for poly-bags, there also the smallest type that Lego makes.</p>

<h4>
	Parts</h4>
<p>
	As far as parts, there are 51 of them, nothing really special there fairly common elements that have all been put in other sets before. But there is a nice selection of dark blue elements that are always a plus.</p>

<h4>
	Minifigures</h4>
<p>
	No Minifigs in this set.</p>
<h4>
	The build</h4>
<p>
	Its really straight forward there are only 11 steps and is really not a challenging build at all. I do really like the use of the 'Brick, Modified 1x4 with Groove' they just give it a nice look when you are done.</p>

<h4>
	The completed model</h4>
<p>
	Overall when your done it is a great rendition of the MTT, however the color scheme in my opinion is terrible. It is a color scheme from the 'Clone Wars' TV series which has put some terrible spins on a lot of the Star Wars universe for vehicles to the characters, so it is possible to sub out colors to make an episode 1 accurate version of this MTT. But when you compare it to the 'Clone Wars one it is a fairly well designed model. And as far as playability there is nothing much at all.</p>

<h4>
	Summary</h4>
<p>
	It has some good parts, nothing new though. Its not a very exciting build but thats what you normally get for a poly-bag. there are a couple of NPUs also. It is defiantly a impulse buy and would make a great stocking stuffer for any Star Wars or Lego lover.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-21T19:01:09.257Z","The Sounds of Thunder Rumbling","<p>Set #30059 MTT: Standing, I believe, for Mobile Troop Transport, this mini model is based on the Trade Federation, and later, Seperatists' Battle Droid Carrying vehicles that travel over numerous types of terrain to deploy their soldiers.</p>
<p>Quite frankly the model is simple, fun and interesting at the same time, it lacks pretty much only one thing, a sense of scale. Of course that's what a Micro-Style build is for. The model uses mostly gray and a rich dark blue color for the pieces, with a few black pieces added to break up the color. I find the model a bit difficult to recognize in all honesty, I mean don't get me wrong it does bear a striking resemblance to the vehicle in question. The problem is the color choice makes it more associated with the Clone Wars era coloring for the vehicles instead of the much more familiar brown coloring of the vehicle seen in Phantom Menace.</p>
<p>I bought myself two when I found it on TRU shelves because I knew I'd want more than one at least. And I do not regret the purchase, however it isn't for everybody. It's a nifty looking model that is easy to build, looks like the vehicle it is meant to be on a small scale and comes with nice rich blue sloped pieces in a darker color than we're used to seeing. That being said though, unless you're a hard core polybag collector or really into the micro builds I think this is one you can safely pass up. Especially considering the scaricty of this item around the globe.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
