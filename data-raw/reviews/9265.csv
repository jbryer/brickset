"Mandalorian","2012-12-26T15:22:44.333Z","""Jatnese be te jatnese"" (The best of the best)","I got this set for Christmas, built it yesterday, and I must say, it immediately became my favourite set. <br><br>Minifigs:<br>An Obi-Wan, a cool Mando and the beautiful, accurately detailed and charming Pre Vizsla (who, if for some reason you don't want to put his helmet on him, also comes with a hairpeace.). That guy is absolutely awesome, one of my favourite minifigs.<br><br>The build:<br>is really fun, and building each section is different from another. The cockpit is rather normal, has a few of those ""ah, that's clever"" and ""so THAT's how they did that"" moments, uses mostly medium pieces. The wings, on the other hand, are made up of a bunch of huge plates, and when building them, progress is clearly seen. The set features a few stickers.<br><br>Appearence &amp; functions:<br>Oh man this thing is such a beauty. Sleek, streamlined, and big. Bigger than it looks on the box. Also, this is one of the occasions that the actual set looks way, way better in real life than on the box. The wing-lifting function works great and the wings stay in whatever position you want them in. The landing position is clever, however, IMO, they look best layed flat like the body. The front part of the cockpit rotates on a Hero Factory ball joint so don't worry about it spinnig like crazy. Apart from the obvious opening cockpit, the Gauntlet also features two hatches, one on the bottom and one on the top of the rear part of the body. Whichever one you open, you will get a small gray crate. Oh and front landing gear which works pretty much as you expect it to work.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Epic ship</li></ul><ul><li>Great minifigs (especially Vizsla)</li></ul><ul><li>Fun build</li></ul><ul><li>Good parts</li></ul><ul><li>Cool functions</li></ul><ul><li>Very good value.</li></ul><br>Cons:<br><ul><li>The guns at the back are hard to put on.

"Eggyslav","2012-12-29T08:29:05.35Z","Nice Fighter","<p>This set was one of the two SW sets I've buyed to come out from my Dark Ages. It really is a very cool, sleek Vic-Viperesque fighter, with nice features. Main one are the wings, which rotate around the ship's axis, and swivel up and down. There also is retractable landing gear, which paired with rised wings provides a sturdy landing position. On the back, there is a cargo hold, with a grey box (Perfect to store Pre Vizsla's blond hair, which are also in the set), two hatches, and a convenient Dark-Saber compartment. I just love the color scheme, white, blue, and some bleys together look so well, and give a real Mandalorian feel to it. The minifigs are also great, the star of the set is the proud owner of the fighter, Pre Vizsla, he has a really cool armor, quite different from a standard Mandalorian armor, printed legs,&nbsp;a short but nice&nbsp;cape, metallic helmet and Jetpack, and, offcourse his trademark Darksaber. Did I mention, that there's also a&nbsp;hairpiece for Pre?&nbsp;Next is your standard Mandalorian soldier, I guess he's Vizsla's bodyguard, and/or pilot, since he was given just a small blaster pistol. Still a nice figure, and if you own Mandalorian Battlepack, another trooper for your army. Then we have Obi-Wan. he's the weakest, and most boring&nbsp;fig in he set, IMHO. I would prefer another Mandalorian, with bigger gun,&nbsp;But still,&nbsp;Master Kenobi&nbsp;has a nice&nbsp;blue lightsaber, so I cannot compain. The build was quite enjoyable, not much fancy technics, a little Snot here, a little there. Three nubered bags divide the build in three fases: First, we build the Cocpit, and minifigs, next is the rear part of the ship, and third, we have wings, which&nbsp;are quite repetetive to build, but they need to be identical, so deal with it. Now the Pros &amp; Cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A very sleek designed ship, with graceful curves on SNOT cockpit, and vic-viper like wings</li><li>Cool features, Cargo compartment, rotating cockit, posable wings.</li><li>Awesome Pre Vizsla Minifig, that is exclusive to this set.</li><li>If the features will bore you, the fighter is very Swooshable</li><li>Sturdy construction.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The grey cones at the back fall off easily. Solution: Put them the other way on pistol pieces.</li><li>Stickers, Stickers everywhere, even controls in the cockpit are stickered. (But the lid on the box in cargo hold is printed)</li><li>Boring Obi Wan fig in all of it's&nbsp;Clone Wars Fugliness.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I think that's a really good space craft, and a fine set. It's worth of its price, and works as well as a display piece, as it does as a swooshable toy.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4
"Tar_Domo","2014-09-04T15:06:43.773Z","Another Mandalorian Theme Set","<p>For a few years ago LEGO released the battle pack with Mandalorian Troopers and the year 2013 brought us the Mandalorian Speeder. I&acute;m still waiting Duchess Satine LEGO!</p>

<p>This set is from 2012 and it was not available in every store. Nowadays it&acute;s even harder to find it &acute;cause it&acute;s a retired product.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box was quite big. When I bought this I thought that this is going to be a big set and it&acute;s not even too pricey. But what comes to the piece count it&acute;s not that big so don&acute;t get too happy about the size before you have built the fighter.</p>

<p>Instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces are in three bags. Bag one contains the cockpit and the others the wings. This set contains a lot of big parts but not a lot exclusive parts. For ship MOCs this has great pieces but not for base MOCs. Most of the bricks are blue, grey or white.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This contains three interesting minifigures. I&acute;m still waiting Satine as I said but that&acute;s not a must at this set so we go with the things that we have:</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi is greatly detailed Clone Wars version. He is a nice add to the set but he&acute;s not a must-have minifigure if you have another Clone Wars Obi-Wan.</p>

<p>Pre Vizsla is an exclusive minifigure in this set. He comes with hairpiece and helmet. He has also a short blue cape. He has some personal details on his helmet.</p>

<p>Mandalorian is a nice extra. Slowly we can build our Mandalorian army by getting some new minifigures in a year or two.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The wings were of course a bit repetitive but the cockpit was really interesting to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is good for play and display. You can roll the wings around the cockpit and you can turn the wings to two different modes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good set for CW Collectors. It&acute;sw a 4-star set.</p>
