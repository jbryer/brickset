"Ha876","2012-07-10T18:21:02.493Z","Palpatine's Arrest is Wonderful","<div>After hearing of the news that lego was going to make this set, I was truly astonished. How the lego group were going to recreate the infamous scene of the chancellors suite was what concerned me. Being a TFOL(teen follower of lego) I'm not exactly the one to go around and actually play with the set, but rather collect, display and review the set and talk about it<b>(on Youtube)-my username is ha876 and I would appreciate it if you would go to my channel after reading this review as I have many other reviews and cool lego videos</b>. This is great in the fact that it includes 6 minifigures. I am going to start of my review with Anakin Skywalker. Knowing that this set takes place in Episode 3 of the STAR WARS prequels, LEGO has done a good job on the mini figure. This mini fig closest in relation to the one that we got in Anakins Jedi Interceptor earlier this year. The differences that I see are the one in this set includes a cape a different double sided head and new printing on the leg and torso.Be reminded however that all the minifies included in this set are not Clone Wars based and rather upgrades of their previous renditions or totally new characters all together. The next mini figure that we have is Kit Fisto. He has only appeared in two other sets before, the most recent one being the 2012 ARC-170 Starfighter. He has not changed since then and is the only mini figure &nbsp;not exclusive to this and not brand new. Now we come to Jedi Master Agen Kolar. He did have limited roles in the star wars saga and has only had a handful of speaking parts but regardless he is on the jedi council and a useful mini figure. His headpiece is the identical to eeth koths in the 2011 Reublic Frigate. Mace Windu in my opinion has to be one of the most bad ass jedi of all time and his mini fig certainly does not disappoint. His new face and the addition of his cape make him that much cooler. The final jedi that we get in this set is Saesee Tin. We have seen Clone Wars renditions of him in last years T6 Jedi Shuttle and this waves Saesee Tins Jedi Starfighter but this is the first ever non CW version of him to date. He has the same headpiece but his face looks much better. Start the Sith soundtrack cause now &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>we have one of the most evil sith lords of all time, Chancellor Palpatine. I think the only new aspects of him are his non CW face and his red lightsaber with that awesome dull gold hilt. Imagine if it had been metallic(like dookus saber hilt). He also comes with pieces to replicate his force lightning ability.</div><div>Building this set was a bit more difficult then what I had first anticipated but being of someone with my experience it was completed in no time. This set really feels like 645 pieces. After building this set it really reminded me of the Home One Mon-Calimari Star Cruiser set back in 2009. The little jedi air speeder is nice and contains 2 dreaded flick fire missiles and an opening cockpit for anakin. Its landing pad is nothing special but finishing the stairs of with flat tiles really makes it look a lot better. The door to the chancellors room does slide in and out but is not to great.Something that i did not know about the set until getting it was that the air speeder landing pad and entrance/door can both be detached and re-inserted to a different area(RIGHT, MIDDLE,or LEFT) using pins. Moving up the iconic table and chair of the grand chancellor we see some nice detailing. There are two other chairs on the other side of the table that rotate a full 360 degrees. This is completed with the nice large glass windows surrounding the table area and in the movie would have the city of coruscant as a familiar backdrop. This is a good addition because it is a very used area in the clone wars series and in the episodes 1,2, and 3, you can use it to recreate scenes other than then when chancellor is confronted by the jedi. Something that I had thought of recently was that in the extra pin holes you could attach your extensions and if you think about it, you can extend this set out infinitely and increase your play value greatly.On this note I give this set a rating of nine out of ten. A must buy for any lego Lego Star Wars fan. Some information that will come out after my review will be the price in dollars for this set. I got this set in Europe when I was on vacation so I didn't have to pay the hefty shipping charge. I feel that will price this set at $90 but it could be anywhere from $70 to $110. Whatever the price, if you buy this set you will definitely be glad that you did.</div>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"CapnRex101","2012-08-27T14:05:40.633Z","9526 - Palpatine's Arrest","<p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">Palpatine’s Arrest was a set which I was very excited about prior to the release of images, due to the incredible scene from the movie, and also the fantastic characters who might feature in such a set. Once the model was revealed however, I found myself a little underwhelmed by it all and although the Minifigures were all that I had hoped for, the actual scene left something to be desired. Now that I have the set, I have in fact found myself rather liking it. While accuracy may have suffered a little at the expense of play features, these features are good fun and this is an excellent representation of that fateful scene from Star Wars Episode III, the Revenge of the Sith.</span>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The box artwork is not bad, but the background and the actual model really do not line up very well in my opinion. Of course this entire scene happened indoors in the film, but here Palpatine’s Office is displayed on a shot of the Coruscant cityscape with several huge towers visible and a couple of landing platforms. On one of these it is possible to see the Naboo Royal Starship (I think we are all hoping for a Lego version of that one day). In the office we can see all four of the Jedi who arrive to arrest Palpatine, the Dark Lord of the Sith himself leaping in to action, and the troubled Anakin Skywalker approaching quickly in his Jedi Airspeeder. Along the right hand side of the box is a dark blue border on which the six Minifigures are displayed. With the exception of Kit Fisto, all six have the word ‘new’ stamped next to them and along the top of this box cover is a fantastic image of Darth Maul and the Lego Star Wars logo.</p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">On the back of the box is another shot of the set with various smaller pictures demonstrating the features. These include the sliding doors, the opening cockpit on the Airspeeder, the Lightsaber and Sith lightning storage, and the collapsing window section as well as one or two others. There are a few images of the scene in the film being recreated in Lego and a blueprint style shot of the Jedi Airspeeder from numerous aspects.</span>
<p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The instructions were perfect with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces. There is only a single instruction booklet and unlike most of the new Lego Star Wars instruction manuals, this one has no comic in the back.</span>
</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">There are quite a few highly desirable parts in this set, including many dark red pieces; this is a fairly uncommon colour and a very attractive one. There are some nice big window sections which may be useful and of course a large number of dark grey plates of various shapes and sizes. Of course the golden lightsaber hilt is very nice indeed, albeit totally inaccurate to Darth Sidious’ Lightsaber in the film and the piece does in fact appear in a couple of Ninjago sets which are far cheaper than this one. The pieces of lightning used by Sidious are great and perfectly fulfil the role of Sith lightning I think.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The pieces used to make the tops of both Agen Kolar’s and Saesee Tiin’s heads are both amazing and are printed with incredible detail.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Best of all in my opinion, we get two metallic gold Microfigures which represent the strange statues that Palpatine has throughout his office which are very rare indeed and look fantastic.</p><p></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">There are six Minifigures included in this set and I will begin with the Jedi Knight,&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Mace Windu</strong>. This figure is exclusive to this set and is very nice indeed. His head piece is cast in brown and is printed with a fair amount of detail. He has a very serious expression which is well suited to him, and a couple of lines for cheek definition printed on his face. Being bald, there is of course no hair piece. He wears a brown cape which is very simple but accurate to the one worn in the film.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">His torso is printed on only the front sadly, but the cape is present which would obscure the printing anyway. Nevertheless, I always like to see some back printing on my Lego Minifigures nowadays. The printing on the front is almost identical to that seen on his Clone Wars counterpart featuring dark tan Jedi robes with some creasing, a white under-shirt and some skin visible in the neck area. His belt however differs very slightly from the Clone Wars version with a silver buckle in the centre and two smaller brown buckles on either side of that. On the older Clone Wars edition, these smaller buckles are black. His arms are dark tan to match the torso and his hands are brown. The legs and hips are dark tan as well and are unprinted which is a little disappointing given that most figures recently seem to have had some sort of leg printing. He carries one accessory, which is of course his purple lightsaber with a metallic silver hilt. Mace Windu is a real favourite of mine and I still believe that Lego has yet to produce a really definitive version of this character; however, the figure is still very nice, albeit similar to previous incarnations.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Now we move on to&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Anakin Skywalker</strong>, who at this point in the film is really struggling with his emotions. He is similar to the figure included in set 9494, Anakin’s Jedi Interceptor, but does have one or two differences. The hair piece is identical, it is the same tussled hair as we see on the Clone Wars Anakin Skywalker, but here it is cast in dark brown which is much more accurate to his film appearance. The head piece is printed with two alternative faces, one of which is simple with a slight smile (an odd choice in my opinion as he did not do any smiling in this scene), some black eyebrows, and several wrinkles and lines on his face, as well as his many scars which are very accurate to the film. The other face has a much angrier face with sunken eyes and the same scars and lines for cheek definition. Both look excellent, but I much prefer the second of the two as that one is more suited to him in this scene by far. He wears a brown cape, exactly the same as his Jedi counterparts which did not appear on the other most recent movie Anakin Skywalker Minifigure.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">His torso is exactly the same however with some highly detailed printing including his black Jedi robes, brown under-shirt, and brown belt with several pouches and a silver buckle. On the back of the torso are some more of the robes and his belt with yet more pouches! His arms are black, his left hand is flesh coloured, and his right hand is black as he wears a glove over his mechanical hand on that side. Unlike the other figure in this set Anakin Skywalker does feature some hip and leg printing, albeit very simple. The hips are printed with some more of his creased Jedi robes and the legs have the black robes hanging down his front which is created simply by printing a black rectangle on each leg which looks fantastic I think. He comes with a blue lightsaber as usual.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The only villain included (sort of), is the iniquitous&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Chancellor Palpatine</strong>. This is the first Chancellor Palpatine figure from the live-action films which has been released and he is excellent. His hair is the same as that of the Clone Wars version, with a neatly tended hair style featuring some nice hair texture detail and a fairly accurate look for the figure. His head is great as well. Two faces are printed on the head piece, one of which shows his standard, more human, face with gritted teeth, blonde eyebrows, and many wrinkles which really expresses his anger as he fights the Jedi and is ideal. The other face shows him after he has been blasted by his own force lightning with many more wrinkles and a much more deformed appearance. Here, his eyes are bright yellow due to him being corrupted by the Sith and his teeth are yellowed slightly which looks amazing.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">His torso is printed with a dark red shirt featuring a belt and on top of that is a dark grey cross pattern which is just like what is seen on this character in the film. He also has a dark red jacket on which has some tiny grey wavy lines printed on it, which are continued on the back of the torso and are also accurate to the film. Around his neck some flesh is visible and his arms are dark red and hands are flesh coloured. The legs and hips are plain dark red, some printing would have been nice to continue his long robe, but this looks fine in my opinion. Darth Sidious carries a few accessories, the first of which is his unique gold hilted, red lightsaber. This looks quite good, but is not accurate at all and I would like to have seen a chrome gold at least, as the piece is in fact cast in pearl gold, making it a little less special. He also comes with two lightning pieces which represent his Sith lightning, I find these superb personally and although they have been included in sets before, such as set 10188, Death Star, they are a lovely inclusion. All in all, a great figure of an awesome character.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; ""></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">Next is&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Kit Fisto</strong>, the Nautolan Jedi from Glee Anselm. This figure too is very similar indeed to previous versions, in fact there is only one slight change to this character. His head piece is the same as it has been since 2007, when set 7661, Jedi Starfighter with Hyperdrive Booster Ring, was released. The component is cast in a reasonably soft rubber in sand green and printed with two large black eyes, a small smile, and some brown straps which run across the top of his head and down the sides just like in the film. The moulded detail of his tentacles is fantastic and the only thing that could improve this part in my opinion would be if the piece was not cast in rubber, but the standard ABS plastic. He wears a brown cape like Mace Windu (and the other Jedi included) which is the only change between this figure and the others.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">Like Mace Windu, this torso lacks back printing, but again it would only be covered up by the cape anyway.&nbsp; The front however is highly detailed with a brown Jedi robe, a dark grey under-shirt and a dark grey belt. There are some folds in the fabric printed on here, his arms are brown and his hands are sand green. The leg piece is plain reddish brown, again with no printing at all. Kit Fisto comes with a simple green lightsaber. The blade is the newer darker shade of green which looks much better than the old version and the hilt is metallic silver.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">&nbsp;At this point the figures may sound a little bit underwhelming, but do not worry, as they start to improve from here on in beginning with&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Saesee Tiin</strong>. The horn and cranium piece is fantastic; it is exactly the same as the ones on the Clone Wars Saesee Tiin and features some very nice dark orange printing on the top and the speckled design around the edges of the part. There are some black lines which form wrinkles and the dark grey striping which runs down the back of his head just like in the film. His horns are dark tan in colour and the piece lines up nicely with the printing on the head. There is only a face on one side of the head piece and this is very detailed indeed. He has a serious, but somehow slightly sombre expression and a huge amount of wrinkles printed on his face which even reaches a point where the horn piece covers up the design. The very compact nose has been emphasised on the figure which looks accurate, but slightly odd in my opinion, however the incredible detail more than makes up for this minor drawback in my opinion. He wears a brown cape just like the other Jedi in this set like he does in the film.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">The torso printing is brand new and looks wonderful featuring some dark brown creased Jedi robes with a dark tan undershirt. His belt is dark orange and has several pouches and a buckle printed on it which looks great. This torso does have back printing unlike Mace Windu and Kit Fisto which shows some more of his creased Jedi robe and the rest of the belt. It is a simple design but is nevertheless accurate, which is an important factor in my opinion. The arms are dark brown and his hands are flesh coloured. His legs are dark brown and are left unprinted. Just like Kit Fisto this figure comes with a green lightsaber with a metallic silver hilt as one would expect.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; ""></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">The final member of the Jedi task force sent to arrest Chancellor Palpatine is the first to die, and probably the most obscure,&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; "">Agen Kolar</strong>. Uniquely among these six Minifigures, this is the first time an Agen Kolar Minifigure has been produced and will probably be the last unless they make another version of this scene in years to come. He has the same hairpiece as Eeth Koth as they are of the same species, but this one is very different in colour to that of Eeth Koth. The hair is black and runs a long way down the torso on the front and back, with some binding keeping it neat and tidy at the rear. The skin area is brown and the horns are dark tan. Around his forehead he has a series of black dots which look good and are just like he has in the film. The head is also brown in colour and is printed with a serious expression, black eyebrows, and some more black dot patterns. He wears a brown cape which is just like what he wears in the movie.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">The torso is mostly tan in colour and he is wearing a simple tan Jedi robe with some creases in it and a brown undershirt. His belt is dark brown and has some pouches on it which looks great and this belt is continued on to the back of the piece along with the layered Jedi robes, although this back printing is all obscured by the cape. His rams are tan and the hands are brown in colour. I love this torso personally, and think it could be very useful for any custom Jedi you might wish to make. His hips and his legs are both entirely plain tan with no printing at all. Agen Kolar wields a simple blue lightsaber with a metallic silver hilt.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The build phase is quite enjoyable and features a few interesting building techniques, including one or two which I have not previously encountered.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">You start by constructing the compact Jedi Airspeeder which uses some SNOT to achieve the streamlined appearance of the tail fin, this seems a little unnecessary to me, but it is always nice to see the designers using more varied techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">Next you move on to the landing pad and sliding doors. These sliding doors will not be new to most Star Wars fans who have made Star Wars related MOCs, but I believe such a door has never before been seen in Lego so for less experienced builders, this may be a new technique for creating doors of this kind.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The dark red floor area is constructed at different angles which is very nice and has been formed using hinge bricks and wedge plates which create a flush and smooth surface. Last of all is the actual office area which contains a great deal of Technic parts to allow the functions to work and some more SNOT to make the brilliant desk. This mixture of System and Technic construction really adds to the building experience in my opinion resulting in a most entertaining two and a half hours or so. &nbsp;</span>
</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The actual model is certainly more about play features and functions than accuracy, as there are numerous differences between the scene in the film and this set. However, the features are excellent, making this set a huge amount of fun if you are intending to play with it rather than simply display it. I will begin with the Jedi Airspeeder (a DC0052 Airspeeder to be precise) which is a nice sturdy design, and a fairly accurate representation of the actual vehicle in the film. It features an opening cockpit and two flick fire missiles which are decent features, unfortunately however the cockpit contains no controls of any sort which would have been welcome and the pilot must almost lie down flat to fit in the cockpit. Three stickers are used to add the open circle symbols on the front of the ship and the detailing on the top of the cockpit. The two engines are found on the back of the vehicle and underneath is a protruding cylinder which allows the Airspeeder to dock on the landing platform included, but this does not look too out of place when you are simply flying it around.</span>
</p><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The landing platform section is very basic indeed but is nevertheless suitable for the task. It is octagonal in shape and has four translucent blue tiles on it which act as landing lights. There is also a hole for the Airspeeder to slot on to. Leading from here to the office itself are a set of dark and light grey steps up to the sliding doors which look fantastic. The landing platform can be separated from the doors and is attached using two Technic pins which allow one to rearrange the set as you wish. A dark red carpet runs down the centre of these doors which adds to the regal and luxurious feel of Palpatine’s Office and on either side of the doors are two black lamps. The doors slide open very smoothly and one figure can fit through with ease. This section connects to the main office area using Technic pins as well.</span>
</p><p><span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "">The largest section of the model is the actual office as one would expect and it looks superb. The carpet of the lower area of the office is dark red and has two golden statues on grey plinths sitting on it, other than that it is empty which allows easy access to play with the Minifigures here. The doors and landing platform can be fitted at any of the three angles making up this floor area but I prefer to keep it central for accuracy’s sake.</span>
</p><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Steps lead to the upper area of the room where you find three holoprojectors, two lovely swivelling chairs which are frequently sat in by members of the Jedi Council such as Yoda or Mace Windu in the films and the Clone Wars television programme, and Palpatine’s desk as well as his elaborate chair. The vast panoramic window which is present in the film is also here on the model and looks outstanding in my opinion. Most of the wonderful features are found up here, including the two catapult like sections of the floor which allow you to recreate Palpatine’s huge leap to attack the Jedi. One must really line up Palpatine perfectly to fling him in the right direction towards the Jedi and this can take some time so the feature does not work perfectly at all. There is a catapult on either side of the desk and just behind that, closer to the window, are two opening sections of floor in which Darth Sidious’ Sith Lightning and Lightsaber can be stored for him to reveal when the Jedi arrive to arrest him.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">My favourite feature however is the opening window which can recreate the moment when Mace Windu is flung out of the office to fall to his death. A pin which supports the window panel can be removed from the side of the model releasing the window so it collapses along with a portion of the floor where master Windu can stand to be thrown outside. It would have been easier, and perhaps more effective, to just have a small lever which opens the window but this works well nevertheless. Strangely, according to the instructions, Palpatine’s chair should be placed quite a long way from his desk closer to the window, and sadly it does not swivel but this can easily be fixed by adding a turntable piece which are very common.</p><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">I would recommend this set, however there are certain aspects which I find a little disappointing, for instance the lack of accuracy at the expense of play features. This is a superb set for playability, with a very swooshable little Airspeeder, lots of moving parts, and all you need to recreate the famous scene from the movie, however for display, it is really a little underwhelming as some areas seem a little simple and unfinished such as the patchwork like floor of the upper office area or cockpit of the Jedi Airspeeder which is left with no controls. However, with a few extra parts added, this model can be greatly improved for display potential.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">The figures though, are a real triumph. We get absolutely everybody we need for the scene and all six Minifigures are nice, especially Palpatine, Saesee Tiin and the brand new Agen Kolar in my opinion. I think the price too is very reasonable (for the UK at least) and you get plenty of marvellous pieces which make this a good parts pack. For those of you who play with your Lego sets it hardly gets any better than this model and I highly suggest you purchase it at the first opportunity, but for display alone this is not the best, and it may be worth spending your money elsewhere on this fantastic selection of Summer Lego Star Wars sets rather than going for this one.</p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; ""><br></p><p style=""margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 14px; "">Overall - 9/10</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Chills","2013-03-28T15:12:28.44Z","""Power.... UNLIMITED POWER!""","<p>Most SW LEGO sets are ships or vehicles from the movies and Expanded Universe, and every so often we get a set depicting a scene. The Hoth Bases, Cloud City, and Jabba's Palace are popular examples. Here we have a set that shows arguably the most pivotal moment in all 6 SW movies: when Anakin Skywalker seals his fate and becomes Darth Vader. This set does a fantastic job capturing that scene.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off, this set isn't 100% accurate with the Chancellor's office in ROTS; however LEGO did quite a good job recreating it. You have a cool landing platform, stairs leading to a short section with sliding doors, then 3 'hallways' that branch off from the main office. The neat thing LEGO did is make the sections modular, so depending on your display space you can adjust where they attach to each other. It also allows for builders to MOC up other parts for the office.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The office room itself is well designed. You ascend stairs between cylindrical holoprojectors to the office chairs, which sit in front of a nicely detailed desk. The desk has a unique design using SNOT techniques. On either side of the desk are pop-up floor sections to simulate the Jedi being taken down by the Sith Lord. Behind the desk is Palpatine's chair, which looks amazingly like the one he uses on the 2nd Death Star (which I'm sure was planned). On each side of the chair are hidden sections for Sith lightning and the awesome red lightsaber with gold hilt. These sections aren't pop-up like the other ones, but open and close smoothly. Finally, in the back we have windows that pop open to simulate the finale of the scene. There's even a small platform which flings Mace Windu over the edge. Nicely done, LEGO.<br></li><li>Pro 3: There are some really interesting pieces, mostly golds and dark reds, that aren't seen in many other sets. I really like the red 'carpet' and the gold statues; both do a great job of recreating the feel of Palpatine's office.<br></li><li>Pro 4: You do get a small speeder, the one used by Anakin in the movie. It's pretty simple, and has the only 3 stickers in the set; but it does look just like the real speeder and adds a swooshable vehicle to the set.<br></li><li>Pro 5: There are some fantastic mini-figures in this set. Technically each one is unique to this set, though a few are similar to ones found in other sets. Both Palpatine and Anakin have two faces, one angry and one Sith (super angry), the others have the usual single face, lightsaber, and cape. Saesee Tiin, Kit Fisto, and Agen Kolar all have awesome molded heads, very highly detailed. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I'm not highly critical of LEGO sets, because the designers usually do a pretty good job. And that is the case with this set. The only thing I would have done differently is to add more pieces to the set to make it more detailed. The price/piece is a bit high, and there could have been more detail with the office and/or the hallway sections.<br></li></ul>
<p>I gave this set a 4 because I am quite pleased with it. I love the mini-figures, the build was a lot of fun, you get some really cool pieces, and there's pretty good playability for an office. I really dig the break-away window and the hidden sections for Palpatine's weapons. There are spots for creative types to MOC up extra sections, and decent detail throughout. I would recommend this set for any Star Wars fan out there. If there were more pieces used in the office to give it a bit more detail I would give this a 5. Side note: CapnRex mentions that this set reminds him of Home One 7754, and I have to agree. I actually have both sets displayed right next to each other. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3

"Shawnjohn","2018-04-15T07:12:10.017Z","Excellent array of figures","<p>This set is retired and will cost quite a bit if you dont do due diligence and look around.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I got a good deal and picked it up thinking &quot;well, the figs are decent&quot;.&nbsp; I got the set home and the build was actually alot of fun and more than I had expected.&nbsp; It comes apart in a few places and the build is done in separate platforms to make it a bit easier to work on and complete.&nbsp; Nothing really special about any of the pieces on the set itself, except the little statue pieces, I found those really nice to have and added a bit of pizzazz to the set.</p>

<p>The set itself is very good for playability and setting up different scenes and the fact that you can pull different platforms apart gives it that much extra to set the set up in different ways and have various different scenes that way as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figs are incredible and definitely some to have if you&#39;re into mocs and such.&nbsp; Lots to go with a jedi council moc or other various battles from the movies or epic scenes that you can recreate</p>

<p>&nbsp;Overall, it&#39;s a great set and definitely is one to add to the collection, both to play with and to showcase&nbsp;</p>
