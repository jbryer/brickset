"Slobrojoe","2020-01-17T07:35:57.257Z","Perfect for a city scape","<p>The New York City taxi? Cool. In Lego? Even better!</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This set is packed as a poly bag. It contains a foldable leaflet instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guess what? They&#39;re yellow like the taxi! There are also a couple of whites thrown in. The most interesting parts are the slanted windscreens and the 2 doors on either side.</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>This build is fairly simple, meaning almost anyone can finish it under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Relative colour scheme</p>

<p>-Accurate</p>

<p>-Cheap</p>

<p>-Works really well in a city build</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Would be great if the slanted windscreens were further apart so a minifig could sit inside, even if it wasn&#39;t included in the bag</p>

<p>Overall, the build is cool and worth 4 stars.</p>
