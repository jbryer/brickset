With the Town Hall being added the theme just keeps on growing in numbers as wellas in quality! I ordered the set the day it was issued in Holland and build it in 2 days. In all (with the sorting of the 2766 pieces) it took me about 10 hours. The building was fun as usual and I did not find any major&nbsp;flaws in the design.</p>

<p>In addition to the info that is given about the sets features on this website and by Lego itself,  I can say the architecture looks fine outside and inside as well! The color scheme is very   ice looking, with the brown-orange bricks as main tone that combines very well with the grey and white tones! Just like the Firebrigade this set has a black belltower and I have to say the design with the white tiles around the clock is a very nice touch. Personally I think especially the frontside really shows an architect at work here (with the roman-like columns and the details on the topfloor and the roof with the grey elements), so compliments to designer Astrid and her colleagues are in order. The set is very spacious and if u do want to play with it that provides enough room to move around and have all the minifigs going about. And with 8 of them there is much playig to be done! Personally I will just add it to my collection where it will look great with the rest of the town. I’m very ancsious about what will be the next addition to the theme!? A bank maybe, or a hospital? </p>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"SgtSmash","2012-03-12T13:19:06.64Z","One of the best modulars yet!","<p>I bought the Town Hall&nbsp;at the Lego Store at the Mall of America this past week, and set out this weekend to put it together. At 2766 pieces, this stood to give me quite a challenge, and figured it would take me a few days to build, however, I was able to put it together in about 8 hours. I will say&nbsp;that this was&nbsp;probably one of the funnest modular sets I've put together yet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interior of the building is fantastic, and offers a ton of&nbsp;detail and&nbsp;play possibilities, especially if you enjoy being the head honcho.&nbsp;Each floor of this building is completely&nbsp;set up&nbsp;for the ""powers that be"". The main floor has a cashiers' office, for I suppose any civic expense, and the large assembly hall where the town folk can meet and listen to the mayor lie...I mean make promises to the taxpayers. The 2nd floor is the mayors' office, complete with secretary.&nbsp;The 3rd floor is the meeting room, with large table and six chairs, and a&nbsp;really cool globe. The&nbsp;roof&nbsp;features&nbsp;a spectacular skylight and clock tower with&nbsp;a very nice detailed clock face which spins. You get 7 minifigs as well, each with their own purpose and lots of play possibilities. Many very colorful and articulate design choices and features went into this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As already noted, this is&nbsp;the tallest modular building yet. It will definitely tower over your town, as well as any other modular buildings you may have. It has a very commanding presence and begs to ""stand alone"",&nbsp;not be attached to other buildings. For being one of the largest modular buildings, it also feels like it is the lightest. Go figure. One nice feature which really is not missed or needed here...NOT ONE&nbsp;STICKER!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just some&nbsp;nit-picky things and stuff that I would have included:&nbsp;For being the nerve center of the entire town where important decisions are made, there is not one telephone in the entire building. The&nbsp;elevator is a nice touch but doesn't offer much in the form of detail (standard black house doors to enter the elevator). It would have also been cool if there had been a car included for the mayor, perhaps one like the sporty blue single-seater which came with the #10184 Town Plan set. No guard in the front lobby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a great set, one worth owning, and no modular collection is complete without it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

	I&#39;m reviewing this because I noticed that when this set was first released, a lot of people seemed to think less of it than previous modules, saying it was more of just a big box. While it is more square, I own all of the sets in this series, and think it is equally as impressive.</p>
<h4>
	Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>
	I got it without a box included, so I can&#39;t vouch for that, but the instructions were excellent, and the dark grey/black issue didn&#39;t cause any confusion at all! Well done, LEGO, for that.</p>
<h4>
	Parts</h4>
<p>
	Excellent parts pack. It has a huge amount of dark orange basic bricks, except Astrid seems to have made an effort to not need to include 1x4&#39;s - I guess they weren&#39;t moulding them in dark orange at the time, or something. Also included are 1x1 round plates in gold and light grey, which are of course a desirable part right now!</p>
<h4>
	Minifigures</h4>
<p>
	I enjoy the fact that all the minifigs have a classic-smiley expression. I&#39;m glad to see these return, and the set offsets this by including many different hairstyles. It shows how much expression can be given without having to change the head.</p>
<p>
	The build of the photographers camera is excellent, and was something I missed looking at the set previously - It was a neat surprise!</p>
<p>
	One issue I had was the magnifying glass the set includes seems to be a poorer quality than the older ones, it has a big rim of clear plastic around the edges, and looks cheap in my opinion.</p>
<h4>
	The build</h4>
<p>
	The build was great, just as enjoyable as the previous sets. There were no bits that felt tedious or repetitive. The construction of the front entrance way is excellent, and it was nice to see how simply it was designed.</p>
<p>
	The roof skylights make use of garage door pieces, which was a great technique to be seen used, and it fits together perfectly. Also, the ladder inside the belltower is a nice touch.</p>
<h4>
	The completed model</h4>
<p>
	It&#39;s massive! I knew this model was larger than previous ones, but had not realized just how much larger...when I put all the sections together, I was impressed. The working elevator is a nice touch, and slides very smoothly. The interior of the model seems like perhaps the best yet, with many different rooms and sections inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Summary</h4>
<p>
	I own all of the Modular Building sets, and this one fits right in. While it costs more, it&#39;s a much bigger model with a lot more parts, so the price is right on par with the others. The square shape of the building lends itself to the kind of structure it portrays - Nothing wrong with that, and this does it excellently!</p>

"skinnylawyer","2013-02-14T16:31:15.247Z","A deserving Town Hall for my Modular Town","<p>I have fallen in love with the Modular Buildings line. While it was the Winter Village series that had brought me out of the Dark Ages, it was the Modular Buildings that allowed me to really appreciate the evolution of Lego parts and building techniques that had taken place since my childhood. The Modulars are quite pricey, but I had to pounce and get Set 10224 Town Hall anyway, when I saw one at the Anaheim Downtown Disney Lego Store discount pile, due to having had its external packaging box crushed at one corner. The damage was good for a 20% discount from the $199.99 list price, and at least there were no missing or damaged parts on the inside, so I was lucking out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Despite the damage, the box was still very appealing. In particular, it showed various scenes from different sections of the building, hinting at many different play possibilities.</p><p>The instructions come in three booklets, one for each level of the building. I wished the instructions were split a bit differently though, considering that the ground floor takes much longer to build than the middle floor on this set.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The light brown is a very pleasing tone for the exterior walls of the building, and for a future MOC, those bricks could come in handy. I also love the globe on the middle floor, as well as the cashier/computer on the ground floor, which is of a modern flat-screen design, and makes for a very nice contrast compared to the monochrome CRT terminals I have in Space Classic sets.</p><p>The use of arch pieces for the front-facing windows is also very awesome.</p><p>The flowers along the window on the middle floor add a pop of bright primary colors - red, yellow, and lime green. The flowers had worked quite well for Pet Shop and they work even better here. I like their presence - adding enough interesting detail to this grown-up building, while using their primary colors to hark back to childhood.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with eight, all with the classic smiley face as is the case with all Modular Building minifigures.</p><p></p><ul><li>Bride: She stands out by using a white sloped brick as her lower body, to represent the skirt of the wedding dress. She is a stunner - because the brick is slightly taller than a standard minifigure lower body, she stands above the others, plus her hairstyle is gorgeous.</li><li>Groom: Looking awesome in his own vest and slacks, but not as much of a standout as the bride.</li><li>Photographer: Her light brown hair and red press jacket look quite good, but my favorite ""feature"" of her is the camera itself, a very nice mini-build.</li><li>Girl: I love her long straight red hair and the floral top.</li><li>Boy: The Space Classic T-shirt is a very awesome touch. That alone already makes him my favorite of the eight.</li><li>Mayor: Dark blue pinstripe suit looks good, along with the light gray hair.</li><li>Secretary: Looking youthful yet professional with slicked-up black hair, scarf, and purple slacks. I always note that Modular Buildings minifigures often have old-fashioned, stereotypical professions, though for a modern touch, I could instead make this woman serve as the Mayor, and the gray-haired man as her key advisor.</li><li>Janitor: I love his white beard, and he definitely is ready to serve the needs of Town Hall. As I built this set, I posed some progress photos where I used the Janitor as the laborer, and the black-haired shopper from Set 10211 Grand Emporium, who looks a lot like me, as my alter ego/contractor/forewoman.</li></ul><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I took some sweet time to build this set - I stretched out the build over a month.</p><p>The front doors are a very interesting build detail, as the various components of the door are put together from transparent and solid bricks. It is always nice to build a special, unique detail from common parts, a challenge that has become rarer among modern Lego play sets compared to the ones I grew up with.</p><p>The installation of a service escalator is a very nice touch as well. An open path allows me to use a knob to raise and lower the escalator during play, and when I need to lock the escalator into a given floor, there is another indentation for the knob to rotate into. Building the shaft was quite interesting, due to uses of tall one-piece bricks at 5x the standard height.</p><p>The roof gable construction is also a nice touch, requiring upside-down pieces to be rotated into position. The Greek columns of the ground floor main entrance also use an ingenious SNOT technique for an authentic look that one doesn't think of as being plausible with Lego elements.</p><p>Even the belfry is a nice build, much better than the pre-molded one of the Fire Brigade. One downside though is that the bell is strictly static and cannot swing, unlike the Fire Brigade bell.</p><p>Love the top floor skylight and its design as well.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is the tallest Modular Building, and definitely looks imposing when placed with other Modular Buildings, though it does not overwhelm the others.</p><p>Between the service elevator, the eight minifigures, and different chambers, there is a lot of play possibility. The conference room on the top floor, and the City Council chamber on the ground floor in the rear, are very good places to congregate lots of minifigures. The city treasurer, the secretary, and the Mayor all have their own offices which look great AND have good play possibilities.</p><p>And of course, with other Modular Buildings and their minifigures added to the mix, the play possibilities go up even further. In fact, when I finished building this set, I went to the Grand Emporium to grab its mannequin for a second wedding dress, and immediately had the Mayor perform a wedding for a women couple - my alter ego and a generic redhead.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For yesterday's children who have fond memories of playing with Lego products, the Modular Building line is an awesome way to bring those memories into the grownup era, with appropriately grownup details to match. In particular, I've really gotten to like the Town Hall, due to its larger size, many different rooms, and details like the functional service elevator, which make for lots of different possibilities when it comes to displaying the set, or playing with it.</p><p>I'm even happier with this set because of the 20% damage discount. Looking forward to many years of enjoyment with this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Givmellis","2012-05-28T09:03:53.523Z","A very special set.....","<p>I bought this set from Lego S@H since as far as I am aware, this is the only place to get it if you live in Australia. &nbsp;I purchased this during the May 4th promotion to take advantage of the free shipping offer, and the delivery time and the packaging was first class with the box arriving slightly early and in perfect condition.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing that struck me about this set is that it is huge. &nbsp;There are so many bags of lego when you open it you cannot help but smile. &nbsp;I really enjoy the build experience (as I am sure many of you do) so I took my time with this set (probably about 8 hours all up) and enjoyed it the whole time. &nbsp;The instructions are well mixed up, with the instructions generally alternating from building the walls (which could potentially get a bit repetitive) to fitting out the interior. &nbsp;This keeps the interest level high, and as a testament to how great this is to build, my partner helped out the whole way and she is not normally into building!</p><p><br></p><p>The actual finished product is just phenomenal with intricate interior detail (personally I think this is the highlight of this model and sets an exceptional standard for future modulars) and the finished product is huge. &nbsp;I think this is the perfect centre piece for a Lego City layout as it will tower over the town.</p><p><br></p><p>The colour palette is interesting. &nbsp;From reading other reviews and opinions my general impression is that some don't rate it too highly. &nbsp;I think it is great for two reasons. &nbsp;Firstly it fits with the Town Hall theme perfectly, very conservative and it ""feels"" right. &nbsp;Secondly, the brown/grey/dark grey scheme mean that where colour is used, it stands out beautifully, such as the flowers at the front or the many features of the internals.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the mini figures are just great. &nbsp;I think the janitor is my favourite, but special mention to the wedding photographer.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, this is a great set, and one sure to please for years to come. &nbsp;I rated playability a four just because I didn't think this set lent itself as well as it could of in that area. &nbsp;Overall though, definitely 5 bricks!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
