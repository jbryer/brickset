<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Like all the other architecture sets, it has a really nicely bound, extra big instructions book. It's a total of 83 pages with plenty of extras related to the opera house in general.<h4>The build</h4><p>The architecture series is not like all the other sets out there. It is more about the look of the final build than interesting builds. While not exciting, I do like the way it handles the diagonal parts of the model. <br></p><h4>Final Model<br></h4>
<p>The final model only looks so-so, and is also quite flimsy. I've had to re-attach the arches a number of times.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While it was a super-difficult subject to re-create, it does not pull it off very well. I think the scale is just too small to pull it over very well. Probably my least favorite of the series so far.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2
"EastFB72","2012-09-09T10:10:57.3Z","Great little set of iconic building","<p>After searching for hours through the Lego website I decided I wanted to buy a new set to have fun with after a few years away from Lego... Seeing I visited Sydney a couple of years ago I felt as though I had to build this set seeing the Opera House in one of my favourite buildings in the world.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pro 1: Nice and small building... Perfect as display on a desk etc... 
<li>Pro 2: Easy instructions to follow and doesnt take long to build (no more than an hour)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1: Some bits can be slightly awkward to put together especially the roofing.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all was a great set to build and will definitely be buying more sets from the Architecture range... Great addition from Lego</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,1,5
"tomalphin","2014-03-14T02:58:18.38Z","One of the worst sets in a great series is still fun.","<p><strong>About me: </strong>I am an AFOL who has been building at least 1 set each year for my whole life. I try to build most sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions. &nbsp;That said, this model didn&#39;t make sense to build in this way since it is immediately clear that many of the mechanical details are not visible in the picture on the box.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong>&nbsp;Between the rather rough appearance of the photos I saw of this model, and the lackluster comments from a friend of mine who built it, this model wasn&#39;t one that I was especially excited to build. &nbsp;It looks like a &quot;rough sketch&quot; of the famous opera house; the real building is so smooth and sculptural, but the sail-like features of this model look crude and blocky.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes it is a blessing to have low expectations. &nbsp;While hardly a difficult or time consuming build, I was pleased with the designer&#39;s creative approach to recreating a building which is so un-square using the limited array of existing Lego brick shapes. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model:&nbsp;</strong>While a little rough, it is an immediately recognizable recreation of a classic modern design. &nbsp;I prefer the appearance of the much bigger 2013 &quot;advanced model&quot; Sydney Opera House, but it is hardly a fair comparison when that set has more than *10 times* as many pieces as this set.</p>

<p><strong>Part Selection / Value: </strong>This set is way overpriced at 39$ for 270 pieces, although the set does include larger parts than most Architecture sets. &nbsp;(Big Ben is a better model and costs 10$ less. &nbsp;Likewise, The White House is the best set in the series and only 10$ more, and the UN Headquarter is also very good.) &nbsp; Aside from the cost, the part selection is pretty good, including a lot of tan parts, so it may have some appeal for some buyers. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 5/10 on a 10-point scale. While this is the second-worst set in the Architecture series, I still enjoyed building it.</p>

<p>As a puzzle build, this model took around 4 hours to complete. (I did a little at a time over many days.)</p>
