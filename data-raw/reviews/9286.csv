"Monty","2012-05-13T17:49:58.737Z","These are the droids you’re looking for...","<p>Not just R2-D2, but TC-14 available only through the May 4th (Star Wars Day) and 5th exclusive offer from SAH or Lego stores. I bought mine at my local Lego Store. You also got an exclusive numbered limited edition&nbsp;poster (one of 20,398) and a mini TIE Fighter (8028) too. For an expensive SW set, the exclusive freebees helped with the value for money.</p>
<p>The box has a flap and slot so it can be reused and it is not necessary to tear anything to open it so it can be kept in pristine condition. More on the box later. There are 3 instruction booklets protected by cardboard insert – the 3rd one does the “head” only. The first picture in the book shows the new orange brick separator, but it is not included in the set – so why show it – or better still, why not include one in the larger more expensive exclusive sets to save us having to pay for one as an accessory.</p>
<p>Parts are in 15 numbered bags, but there are 2 bags with numbers 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 - the highest numbered bag being 10 to coincide with the 10 building stages of the model.&nbsp;Because this set has so many parts it is helpful having to restrict your search to one or two bags at a time as you build each section.</p>
<p>It is built with the bottom of the body first, then the middle then the top. You then make the internal mechanism to hold the middle leg and foot including the locking switch held in place by rubber bands. &nbsp;I am not convinced the middle leg/tread works that well as it drops under its own weight on a rack and pinion mechanism and has to be locked in either the up or down position. WARNING do not operate the switch when the model has been posed on 3 legs as it will allow the middle one to retract causing the whole thing to topple forward which could end in disaster depending where it is standing at the time. There are opening doors on the front that allow for the buzz saw and the computer interface arms to be raised by twisting 2 cross&nbsp;axle linking bricks that slightly project from the rear – clever. Not sure if custom parts were used for the arms here, but I have not seen them before. There are also other clever SNOT techniques used like the use of City vehicle wheel arch bricks to make the edges of the front recesses. There are other opening blue sections on the front too.</p>
<p>Much of the interior has a “rainbow effect” with virtually all main Lego colours being used with red, yellow and green in much evidence – I personally don’t like this on models as it looks like the sort of thing a small child would build with what bricks they have to hand rather than thinking about a scheme that may approximate to an interior. Good news is you cannot see these from normal viewing angles on the finished thing, and if you ever break the set for parts, you will have a good variety of colours.</p>
<p>Next up are the side legs which are basically a left and right handed version of the same thing. These can move backwards, but not forwards due to handrail bricks preventing forward movement. The treads have a lift and drop mechanism as well as a pivot function. This enables the model to sit lower on the legs in 2 legged mode and for extension and repositioning of legs and treads in 3 legged mode. You then make up a couple of ""motor"" shaped objects which snap to the inside of the treads and are linked by 2 brown flexible hoses&nbsp;(custom part?) each side from the front of the ""motor"" to the front of the tread. Beware&nbsp;the instructions tell you to connect the top ones on the treads to the outer on the ""motors"" and bottoms to the inner – to be accurate to prototype it should be the other way round as indeed it is on the photos on the box and booklet covers.</p>
<p>Finally, the head is made up from the contents of the last 3 bags. This requires careful study of the construction to ensure it is done properly – as the contours need to match those exactly of the body. It uses lots of L shaped plates which must be fixed the right way round to get it correct. It is a slow build up from mainly plates and becomes asymmetrical, requiring further careful construction – I had to undo a couple of parts to get it right. It is nice to cover up the last odd coloured interior bricks (that fix to the cross axle that allows the head to turn) with the final top brick to complete the model.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to pose the model in that distinctive 3 legged mode until you get used to how to do it. Firstly drop and lock into position the middle leg/tread. You then need to move the side legs backwards and let the treads drop downwards whilst at the same time tipping them forwards to get the model to sit correctly – after a few practices you should get the hang of it, but as I said do not unlock the centre leg in this mode – or be prepared for the model to topple forward. I was not sure it was canted backwards enough, wondering if the middle leg was fitted properly and extended enough, but looking at the photos on the box, and models of the real thing at a recent Sci-Fi exhibition,&nbsp;the back of the centre tread sits behind the fronts of&nbsp;the side treads so it&nbsp;is accurate to prototype and correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One annoying difficulty in posing the model on 3 legs comes from one of the bottom 4 x 1 rack bricks constantly falling off from the rear of the centre leg. This is because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;made one side of the leg at the top and bottom from two&nbsp;1 x 4&nbsp;Technic bricks&nbsp;to get the&nbsp;required length, and these flex just enough to&nbsp;ensure the brick works loose and drops off.&nbsp; If this is not to drive you mad, one&nbsp;modification you could make during construction (a little more difficult once assembled) is to use a 1 x 8 Technic brick to replace these&nbsp;to prevent the flexing. I also added another 2 x 4 plate to the rear of the bottom&nbsp;of the middle leg to improve rigidity.&nbsp;The rack brick should then stay in place. As there are already 2 of these 1 x 8 Technic bricks in the set,&nbsp;they could have included 2 more rather than 4 of the shorter ones&nbsp;and reduced my angst.</p>
<p>This model has it all, normal Bricks, some SNOT construction and Technic parts/construction which ensure the build always remains enjoyable and does not get repetitive or monotonous.</p>
<p>Only sticker is for the information “card” for the stand, which is unavoidable - so no points off for that. The stand itself has a nice touch of an R2D2 Minifig sitting on the side – great idea as it has the grey head and is not the same as the older ones.</p>
<p>The model is very accurate to prototype, but i have carried out a few minor modifications (Brickshelf) such as changing the odd colour, removing the blue&nbsp;Technic connectors from the back of the head and just leaving the holes, and altering the pivot point covers of the 2 main legs.&nbsp;I have also&nbsp;added concealed wheels in the bottom of the treads&nbsp;which improves playability if you want to push it around rather than shove or drag it on the slide shoes on the bottom of each of the treads, but these are probably adequate if it is just to be a display model and not be moved. I have also added a&nbsp;third foot to the Minifig on the stand.</p>
<p>The set is a little pricey, but you do get a lot for your money compared to some SW sets, such as the new TIE fighter, and you have a faithful replica of a Sci-Fi icon that even non SW enthusiasts will recognise.</p>
<p>Everyone who has seen the model so far has expressed surprise that having seen the box (which it has to be said is not overly large for the contents of 15 numbered bags and 3 instruction booklets), it is much smaller than they thought it was going to be – this helps me as I am running out of storage space.</p>
<p>This is mainly a display set, but it does have some nice working features that enhance playability, so&nbsp;I think, despite the difficulty in posing it on 3 legs, the set rates a maximum score overall, as for a SW set I think at the price it is much better value for money than many&nbsp;of the recent offerings. You get plenty&nbsp;of parts and a&nbsp;long enjoyable building experience -especially the head.&nbsp;And if like me you bought it on May 4th or 5th you got some nice extra goodies for free.</p>
<p>May the 4th be with you.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Kyriepat","2012-05-25T01:39:35.66Z","Makers of Lego: I want a Bigger and Better R2-D2 next time!","<p>I really really wanted this set! I have been looking foward to this set long before it was released and I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed with how it came out. &nbsp;I am mostly a minifigs collector, but I also indulge in the really ""Big Boxes"" of Lego. &nbsp;I bought this during the May the 4th special (with TC-14) but didn't have time to build it till recently.</p><p>My friend was with me when I opened my box and out popped some very colorful bricks. &nbsp;There were red, yellow, green, etc. She asked me if I was sure that I was building an r2d2...I guess I didn't know r2d2 was so colorful on the inside. &nbsp;In my opinion, this R2D2 was a&nbsp;much easier build than 16+. Like I said, the interior parts are color coded and the bags are neatly numbered in assembly order unlike the other Ultimate Collector sets.</p><div><br></div><div>I thought the hidden extendable buzz saw was a pretty cool feature. &nbsp;You can turn the knob at the back and the little buzz saw pops out, it's very...cute. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The bulk of the build was a set up for the retractable leg which I thought was a nice design with the fancy saw tooth lock and go system. The switch at the back controls which direction the saw tooth track is locked so the retractable leg could be held in place. &nbsp;However, this feature took up a major portion of the build. For a feature that takes up 20% of the build, the retractable leg doesn't extend far enough for the R2-D2 to be in its laid-back-""Chill""-mode. &nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><p></p><div>It was built from the bottom up and I was anticipating a grand finish with the head portion but after I stuck the head on, my reaction was, ""That's It?"" &nbsp;Compared to the sturdiness of the body, the head was a little flimsy, it was very anti-climatic. &nbsp;The finished R2-D2 sits on 2x2 boat studs so it could glide around on a smooth surface if you must make it move. &nbsp;Some wheels on the bottom would have been nice.</div><p></p><p></p><div><br></div><div>Bottomline is that I wouldn't mind paying a little more for it to be bigger and with power functions. &nbsp;Maybe even with lights and sounds and a remote control ... (ok, ok, I can forgo the sound function.) I was ready to fork over more money for it, I really wanted a good R2D2! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><div><div><br></div><div>For now, I will have to re-design it with wheels at the bottom and maybe put some lights in the head.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Not that I don't have one (or a dozen) brick separators already, I also didn't get the brick separator in my box, which was supposed to be included?</div><div><br><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""></div></div></div></div><p></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-01T17:58:12.89Z","10225 - R2-D2","<p>R2-D2 is a legend in the world of Star Wars and translates very well into a Lego model. This is the&nbsp;first&nbsp;set of this kind we have seen since 2002 when set 7194, Yoda, was available. I am delighted that they have&nbsp;resurrected&nbsp;this style of set and I find R2-D2 much more suited to this scale than Yoda was due to his more angular and basic shape. There is a plethora of features in this set as well as unbelievable amounts of detail. For me it is the accuracy of the piece that is the main draw and I can hardly believe how well this set has been created by the designers of this particular model.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The front of the box displays R2-D2 with his third leg extended who is trundling down one of the corridors aboard the Millennium Falcon while looking&nbsp;straight&nbsp;out of the cover at us. A dark blue border is found at the top of the box which features Darth Maul thrusting his lightsaber around. Next to him is the Star Wars logo and a white area which adds a bit of diversity on the otherwise fairly monochromatic design. The bottom left corner has a small framed image which shows the dimensions of the model once it is built.&nbsp;The most prominent image of the reverse side of the packaging shows R2-D2 standing on two legs on what appears to be a sandy&nbsp;Tatooine&nbsp;or Geonosian background. This picture is labelled with small pictures of all of the features. These demonstrate such things as the extendible&nbsp;third leg, rotating dome, and numerous opening panels brimming with hidden gadgets. The display plaque and R2-D2 Minifigure included are also shown on this image. The left side of the box shows the droid from various angles in a blueprint format, which I think is a great feature of the boxes of the sets released this year.</p><p>The instructions have the exact same picture on them as the box. I found no mistakes and had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set includes lots of fabulous pieces. There are many dark blue components including plates, curved bricks and slopes. You also get a huge amount of white which can be very useful of course for use in your own models. I think my favourite elements of the entire set however are the four brown flexible pipes which fit on the feet of the model and look excellent. I have already seen these lovely parts used in various MOCs in the past and cannot wait to see what these new reddish brown versions will inspire. We even get a few rare orange bricks!</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The single Minifigure included in this set is <b>R2-D2</b>. He is a common figure but it is a nice touch that Lego included him in my opinion. I like the figure which has plenty of detail and is very accurate for such a small piece. His domed head is predominantly light bluish grey with blue highlights as well as his black and red sensors. It is printed all of the way around as usual. The cylindrical body piece is printed on the front with all of the panels and dials we see in the movies, as does his larger cousin! The legs are made of the same Astromech Droid leg piece as always.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly long and quite challenging. It uses a lot of Technic parts and it took me about four hours and featured a vast number of superb building techniques, almost too many to describe! But I will give it a go nevertheless. Firstly, the way in which the dome has been created is ingenious and will give you plenty of ideas on how to make them in the future for your own designs. Also on the dome, the way in which the holoprojector on the front of his head is attached at an angle is very clever, using a flick fire missile piece to great effect. The formation of R2-D2's cylindrical torso is excellent as well and is interesting to look at and attempt to emulate. Finally, it is fantastic to see how the designer has kept the droid so strong, despite the huge areas of empty space within. This is done using&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;beams and a durable central pillar.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the model is all finished it looks absolutely spectacular. They have even managed to incorporate the difficult shape of the two fuels tanks slung to the side of each of his treads which I think is a joy, as well as numerous other exquisite details. The greebling on this model is extraordinary! It is just the right size for play and display and even includes lots of features. The grey dome rotates all of the way around and is very nicely made using bricks at various heights and of differing widths. In the body of the droid there are four panels which can be opened. The blue stripes just below the head can open and are meant to reveal a manipulator arm and welding too, of some kind. Both are identical, but open in different directions which is accurate to the films. To the left and right of the dark grey grilled area in the centre of the body are two more panels, one of which has dark blue striping and holds a computer interface arm. The other panel opens to reveal the rotating saw arm we see in Return of the Jedi which he uses to cut himself and a few of the other rebels out of an Ewok trap. Both of these are extended by twisting two small dials on the back of the model and then lengthened using poles which can be pulled out of the pistons which they can be retracted into. To extend the third leg, you must first lift the model so the legs are swinging free, then pull the small lever which fits&nbsp;seamlessly&nbsp;into the rear of the model to release the third leg. R2-D2 stands perfectly with or without the third leg although I prefer to have him on display on two legs to show off the various hidden tools he contains.</p><p>I think that is where this model really comes into its own, for display, it really does not get any better than this! The model even comes with its own black plaque and a spot for placing the miniature R2-D2 included which only adds to the brilliant visual impact of the piece.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I am utterly delighted with this wonderful set and would certainly recommend it. If you have to the money (which by the way is perfectly reasonable in my opinion due to the size and density of the model as well as the massive piece count) do not hesitate in buying it. For those of you who want to play with the model, there is plenty of opportunity to do that, and for display, as I mentioned above, this model is just about unbeatable. It now rest in pride of place alongside set 10221, Super Star Destroyer and is well worthy of such a prominent position. It is not quite my favourite set as I tend to prefer Minifigure scale, however I prefer this model over the likes of set 10212, Imperial Shuttle as well as most of the other Ultimate Collector Series sets.

"darthdc","2014-05-22T13:20:07.687Z","Did they need that many colours?","<p>Well, after missing out on Argos selling this set reduced (no stock locally), I got a second chance with LEGO selling it reduced for Star Wars Day (4th May if you didn&#39;t know). Even with the 15% discount, it is still a pricey set, with just over 2000 pieces for &pound;150. (&pound;127.50 with the discount).</p>

<p>The box is huge, at nearly 2ft high, and yet it isn&#39;t underfilled like some sets. The many bags of pieces take up about 85% of the inside volume. One of the nice things, is that the bags are numbered, allowing you to open them when needed. This should be the norm for all large sets, especially sets of this size and above, for it reduces building time considerably.</p>

<p>The instructions are spread across 3 booklets. The first booklet outlines the build to start with, showing the sections that are built with each set of bags (There are 10 sections in total). Like the VW Camper, the books and the solitary sticker are packaged in a bag with card to keep them flat.</p>

<p>The build is not too complicated, though care should be taken, for its easy to put a piece in the wrong place at times. Starting with the lower body, building up, then adding the technic mechanism for the third leg.</p>

<p>The outer legs are nearly identical, with just some mirroring at the top. Until then, the build for each is identical, so time might have been saved if they stuck to one set of instructions for both, until the mirrored sections came along (similar to how the gun stations on the UCE Millennium Falcon are built.)</p>

<p>The head is well built, though some 1x1 plates either side of the main eye section would have given some rotational symmetry. Most reviews say that the head just sits on top. It does to a degree, but it does attach to an axle, and holds quite firmly. It won&#39;t fall off if you turn him upside down.</p>

<p>The thing that many other reviews point out, is the number of colours used. There are 19 different colours used in this set (Yes, I counted) including the transparent pieces. Most remain inside, and are well hidden, unless you turn the droid upside down. Why the need to build his inside in such a variety of bold colours is a mystery. Perhaps it was done for the prototype build and forgotten.</p>

<p>The appearance is very good, considering the challenges facing the designers. The only thing I don&#39;t like, is the use of bright blue pieces scattered among the earth blue pieces.</p>

<p>The tools inside his torso are cleverly (yet simply) operated. I just find that the circular saw arm is awkward to extend, due to the tightness of the rod inside.</p>

<p>The third leg is, as most have written, the most awkward thing to operate. The locking mechanism (the switch in the middle of the back) can be tricky to operate. With the leg down, the switch has to be pushed down to lock it in place. When the leg is retracted, the switch must be pushed up. You can at least feel the lock work in each case. But whether you&#39;re retracting or lowering the leg, pick Artoo up first!</p>

<p>Another thing pointed out by other reviewers, is the lack of wheels in the feet. The actual robots used in the films, and by fans at conventions, all have wheels. They can be added, since the feet are hollow underneath.</p>

<p>Last is the display stand and minifigure. The minifigure was another draw for me, since its the first new style R2-D2 I&#39;ve got. Its better by far, than the original version with white dome with printed grey face. The display itself has the added bonus of having an 8x16 tile for the sticker, rather than loads of smaller tiles, as all other sets have.</p>

<p>Overall, its a brilliant display piece, and looks good with or without the middle leg lowered. The only down point is the price, which even at the &pound;127.50 I paid, still is a little steep.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A very big box gave me big expectations about the size of the droid when I saw it the first time in Sweden. I was thinking like &quot;that gotta be huge&quot;. Two years later I got Lego Star Wars The Visual Dictionary that told me it&acute;s just about 30 cm high.</p>

<p>The instructions were in three booklets and they were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This contains over 2000 pieces. Most of them are small, though. There are not only white and blue parts. The representation of the parts is huge. There are many rare colors and green and yellow parts.</p>

<p>The 1x1 brick is represented well here. You have it in grey, white, dark blue...</p>

<p><strong>Is this a set for building MOCs?</strong></p>

<p>Not, in my opinion. You get a lot of random parts. If you find use for them, fine, but if not, I understand. There are way too different parts for a MOC. If you need a lot of possibly-useful-some-day pieces, this might be a set for you. As long as the price is not rising too big.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set is kind of a figure but not MINIfigure. It comes with a too common R2-D2. At least I have a ton of them. But with the display stand the small Artoo looks fine. But: Do <strong>not</strong> buy this set for the Artoo minifigure. It is only a nice extra.</p>

<p>In my opinion they could have done a new detailed Artoo minifigure for this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build takes a lot of time. You have to be careful, especially in the beginning.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks great. It is standing next to my Super Star Destroyer, my other UCS set. I&acute;m starting to like these UCS sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It retired. Get one if you can before the price is rising.</p>

<p>hte build was nice and challenging but not too hard. the building techniques included in this set are outstanding and inspired me in many ways. the pieces that were in this set are not just grey blue and white. there is a whole assortment of bright colors inside completely hidden from view and they were really fun to build with.</p>

<p>It has quite a few fun&nbsp;features, like the cutting torch and grabby arm, but it certainly isn&#39;t a playset. It&#39;s size, weight, and what it&#39;s made of (more on that later) precludes it from being a playset. This is a display model for collectors.</p>

<p><strong><em>PROS</em></strong></p>

<p>It is a magnificent set to look at. I own the UCS Slave-1, the Hellicarrier, the Saturn V rocket, and several other very impressive sets, but&nbsp;visually the UCS R2-D2 blows them all out of hyperspace. It is without a doubt the coolest set I have ever seen. And remarkably well detailed, especially for a quite old set.</p>

<p><strong><em>CONS</em></strong></p>

<p>The old white LEGO bricks are notorious for their ability to break or discolour. This isn&#39;t viable as a long-term playset, it really should be kept out of direct sunlight as much as possible, and while it should be moved to prevent it from becoming stiff, it shouldn&#39;t be over-handled.</p>

<p><em><strong>OVERALL</strong></em></p>

<p>I would recommend this model without hesitation to any LEGO collector, Star Wars fan, or anyone looking to give someone a freaking awesome gift. It transcends normal LEGO models, it&#39;s a work of art. As a display model, it is second to none.</p>
