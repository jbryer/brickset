PROS: I love the steps with the platform that crosses above the track. The switch building is neat. I like the smoked windows, computer, and switch tracking system. Nice detail. Also like the numerous rail pieces on the overpass and ground. I like the one figure (engineer with burgundy hat). I also like the truck, esp. the raiser (simple, but it works). CONS: The roof of the building shouldn't be closed off, then have the smoked window piece above. Should take advantage of the light of a sky window. The train engine shed does. I hate the signs with stickers. How about a new Lego train crossing sign that looks like a real crossing sign. I have yet to see Lego make one of these. OK, enough with the same train workers. I have three of this guy now. Price should be around $30 which would seem more reasonable for what you get. Lastly, this is just a recommendation, but I think Lego should make some lighted signs for train layouts. I'm using some lights from Christmas villages now, but a Lego made light kit (with blinking train crossing sign would be great). This is a great crossing set, full-of playability, and designed nicely. Definately pricey though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the crossing, but it would have been better with (custom?) parts for the railroad crossing signs and warning lights rather than stickers to be put on black plates. The Road rail maintenance truck is a nice item – with its retracting rail wheels it can either run on the road or the rails – the driver doesn’t fit inside too well though due to his hat. The footbridge and switch control tower are OK, but will probably look better in a station/depot situation rather than next to a crossing as who would cross via the steps when you can walk over the crossing?

Conductor Minifig is nice as is the computer and track panel inside the building. I shall not be adorning mine with the stickers provided for the windows – can’t really see the point of putting stickers on the windows which look fine as they are. 

I thought there was not much here for the money – 40 GBP and that it would have been better as 2 sets for at least half the price each. I can only give it an 8.

The truck is nice but the bucket just doesnt look right here. The tower is good but the walkway is cheesey would have been better if the used the brick count else where.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-11-22T15:03:05.06Z","Needy of Improvements but Great Set","Well, I wasn't all that crazy of this set. I like the gates and the mechanisms,as well as the bridge, but the signs are pointless. I'd rather have signals like my newer build rather than stickers on a sign. The maintenance truck is nice though. The control tower is good too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"no_skill","2010-01-11T07:10:41.513Z","Very good set!","This is a very good set that falls just short of being a great one.  First, I like the concept of a level crossing with the switch-house and overpass.  I like it a lot.  

The switch-house suffers from some degree of juniorization, however, with several wall elements used instead of basic ones.  The roof appearance gives me mixed emotions, but does keep with the architectural theme of the World City station of the same vintage (4513).

The overpass is just barely, too short for the 10014 caboose, but can be remedied if needed (my only serious annoyance).  The stickers...well, not my favorite part of any set.

Nice details include signal lights on the overpass, a switch yard control board, office computer, and the roof top PA speaker.  The rail truck is a nice addition, and has actual car doors (too rare these days).  Let’s not forget three pieces of 9V straight track either.  It fits in nicely with both the station mentioned above, and the 10027 engine shed.  While this is the only level crossing I own, I find it visually more appealing and complete than its predecessors.

At the time of its availability I thought it was a little pricey (like most of the Train theme), but still a satisfactory purchase.  I’m very glad I decided to pick it up!
