Basic bricks with no design, no feeling for elegance or beauty. To crude to be a real helicopter. No match with the Legoland series. Too big for that, especially the lego figure. Great for the bricks but at that moment I had enough of the standard bricks, I didn&#180;t need those, so for the bricks this set is not good. I was 11 years old when I got this, and perhaps I can say I now, I hated it. It&#180;s a set for a 5 or 6 year old. Too simple, you won&#180;t like it anymore when your two years older. Rating therefore is a 2.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<p>Since this set was made for kids under 5, it looked ridiculous to me, so I remodeled it right away. I saw the opportunity in its size and used it to transport my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe:_Hall_of_Fame"" target=""_blank"">&quot;G.I. Joe&quot;</a> soldiers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the set does not contain rare parts, I used the blue bricks for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/565-1/Moon-Landing"" target=""_blank"">565 set.</a></p>

<p>I recently found the original&nbsp;box, and it had the modified helicopter inside. Today, it &#39;s funny how small the tail and rotor were, but when I was a kid it was good to play <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBIgXhiOpeQ"" target=""_blank"">&quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;</a>&nbsp;I later used it as a fire helicopter.</p>

<p>However, with the parts with which I modified the helicopter, it could have been issued in this form even in 1975, because then these basic parts existed.</p>
