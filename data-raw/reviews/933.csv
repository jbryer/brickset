The top opens to reveal chairs for two passengers plus one for the pilot. Includes an actual pilot minifig wearing a black suit and a black sailor's cap.  The fueling car is pretty junky. It needs doors and more pieces on the front. Comes with three good minifigs.  Easily worth 20 USD if you can find it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
