"Gus_263","2008-01-14T11:26:25.5Z","Simple ","It is a simple set, because it is promotional. Like other promo sets, it is very useful to make creations. This, option for make little cars. The pilot minifigure, to make of citizens or of course, pilots. The wheels to make a little car, and the red pieces to any red car (or ferrari) maded with system bricks. I rate it 5/5 because it is useful and one of my most ancient sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2009-12-18T08:23:36.92Z","Simple but good","Nice little set, think i bought it when we made a ""pit stop"", ofcourse in a shell station, on a family vacation waaaay back, just so i'd have something to do on the long trip.

I remember always racing this against the older ""Sprint Racer"" (6503), and funny enough, the old one always won the match, hehe. This set is very simple, not much to it, not many parts, and a one-piece chassis, so it's a very simple build.

The minifig is excelent, only thing is, who wears sunglasses, while wearing a helmet, with a black visir? They didn't think that one through, did they? 

I remember really liking the slick tyres, which i think was still a new thing back then, but i'm not sure, so correct me if i'm wrong. Anyway, they didn't make as much noise or vibritions when driving them over a smooth surface, so that was a nice detail.

But anyway, as i said, it's a nice little uncomplicated set, fit's your town's racetrack really well, along with some of the other F1 racers/go-carts out there. :)

4/5, because, in my opinion it could have a bit more detail, as well as a bit more parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-02T08:51:17.25Z","LEGO Town (Racing) - Formula 1 Racing Car Review","<p>This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of good and useful pieces which can be used for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. I really like the printed slope with the number '1' on it.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has one minifig. The figure has a white overall, a red helmet, a black visor and black shades on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/2535-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it is still very fun to maneuver it. The only play feature which this model has is that the rear-wing does sviwel. This vehicle has a very good design - even if it doesn't really look like a Formula 1 car.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
