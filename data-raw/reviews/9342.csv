"knightman424","2012-07-05T13:01:27.037Z","First Cuusoo Set","<p>&nbsp; The first Cuusoo set available is a pretty good one. The game Minecraft is a lot like Legos, as you can build nearly anything. The first thing I noticed about the set was the box. I know it has been mentioned in other reviews, but I think it's the first box to have its demensions! The instructions are normal, but the part in the first booklet about Cuusoo is a good touch.</p><p>&nbsp; The build is pretty standard, but being module makes it more fun to build. The two guys, Steve and Creeper are OK, but don't connect with the set (despite what it shows on the box). Steve has printing on the sides of the two 1x1 plates of his head, which is a first.</p><p>&nbsp; Not that much playability, but it is because the people don't connect with the rest of the set. I'm sure if they did, it would be a lot more fun to play with. The set comes with lots of extra pieces, some of which are not even used in the set. It is a lot better than most of the minecraft merchendise, so if you like both minecraft and Lego, you should definantly get it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,4
