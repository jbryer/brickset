Impossible.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,2

<p>VERY NICE, which is the norm for all architectural sets. &nbsp;I really would love to see TLG make these types of boxes for most of their sets, would make storing/inventory-ing of original sets much easier. &nbsp;With many of my more &quot;complicated&quot; sets, I will alter the box so that it opens and closes like the Architecture line. &nbsp;Would even be willing to pay more for every set!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you are an AFOL, the pieces in this set are nice additions to existing collections, IMO. &nbsp;Tan, Tan and more Tan!!</p>

<h3>Minifigures &nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Enjoyed the build. &nbsp;Not the most challenging but watching it come together is, as always fun. &nbsp;Gets repetitive but again, that is not necessarily uncommon for Architecture themed sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve not personally seen Big Ben rather pictures. &nbsp;Whilst not perfect, it&#39;s pretty obvious what it is and I think it looks pretty cool!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As always, you may be paying a bit more than it&#39;s worth but isn&#39;t that pretty much always the case with Lego? &nbsp;I have it on display along with my other 20 or so Architectural sets. &nbsp;If you are an AFOL with a pretty decent existing collection you probably can build this by buying missing/needed pieces off of Bricklink pretty easily which I would recommend as opposed to paying a premium for this retired set.</p>

<p>For those on a budget, this is a perfect, small scale model of the Big Ben clock tower. It&#39;s just fantastic to build. It even breaks down easily to store away in the box it comes with and if you pull it apart correctly, it&#39;s easy to rebuild each time.</p>

<p>The instructions were easy to follow as always with LEGO, including history on Big Ben as well. One of those models you build and have setting somewhere for conversation starters where people can see you&#39;re into LEGO.</p>

<p>Just a beautiful model with right level of details for its size that people know what it is.</p>

"Dude45","2016-09-18T15:45:43.753Z","Could have resembled Big Ben much more","<p>There are two LEGO renditions of Big Ben, the iconic London building. One is a giant model (10253) and the other one is this microscaled Architecture set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually I think Architecture sets do a great job of portraying their originals at microscale, but this one is unfortunately an exception. The problem is the tower&#39;s clockwork. It goes 2 studs out from the tower when it&#39;s supposed to be at the same level. While you probably will recognize Big Ben, the model could have resembled it much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can alleviate the problem to some degree by removing the 2x2 plates that for no good reason has been used underneath the clock pieces, but it&#39;s still not satisfactory. Using a centered 1x1 brick inside with 4 knobs would probably have been a better choice.</p>

<p>The standard LEGO 2x2 clock looks odd in this context. A specially made Big Ben clock brick would be required here, which is not much to ask for given the very high price level for Architecture sets.</p>

<p>One thing this model does better than 10253: the dark green color chosen for the greenery outside the building. (10253 uses a lighter green color which does not look good.)<br />
