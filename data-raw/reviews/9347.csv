And looks great!","<p>I spent most of 2012 coming out of the Lego dark ages and collecting a number of different sets. As I also happen to like to travel, the Architecture line stirred up my interest, especially in case of sets depicting landmarks I have actually visited. For Summer 2012, Architecture gained two new sets, both having been my past travel destinations: Big Ben in London (21013), and this one, Sungnyemun in Seoul. As Big Ben remained sold out pretty much throughout summer, I decided to tackle Sungnyemun first.</p><p>Sungnyemun is the main southern gate to the old walled city of Seoul, the new capital of Joseon Dynasty of Royal Korea (1392-1896). Due to its southern location and its prominence it's better known as Namdaemun (Great Southern Gate), which had been Set 21016's initial proposed name as well. In modern-day South Korea, Seoul has grown well beyond the old walls, which have since been torn down, and the gate is an island of tradition in a traffic circle surrounded by modern skyscrapers. The gate was destroyed in a freak arson attack in 2008 and is currently being restored; while I lived in Seoul in 2008, restoration work was well under way, and on a previous visit to Seoul in 1994, I had managed a snapshot of the gate:&nbsp;http://www.flickr.com/photos/skinnylawyer/5678277441/</p><p>In any case, it added a huge contrast to my Architecture collection which, until purchasing this set, had consisted solely of US landmarks. This is the first East Asian building in the Architecture line, and if I remember correctly, the first such Lego official set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great color scheme. The random pattern of gray for the lower stone portion is a nice touch. The upper tier, where red/tan/green tiles are used under the black roofs to simulate the traditional Korean color scheme, is brilliant. Perhaps Lego needs to add additional East Asian Architecture sets and see how they can portray similar color patterns, but different color palettes, used in Chinese and Japanese buildings.</li><li>Creative parts use. The slanted sides of the base are an excellent touch; this is where the old city wall would've been before it was torn down. Also love the use of 1x1 round tiles on the roof edges, which reflect the white trim at the real gate, as well as the 1x1 clawed tile at the roof corners, to simulate gargoyles!</li><li>Stability. The gate is horizontally oriented and so is this set; it gives off a look of stability in ways other Architecture sets don't.</li><li>Booklet. The facts in the booklet are rather easy to obtain through Internet searches, but the presentation does add to the touch and the understanding as I build the set. And this is a great feature shared with all Architecture sets.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Fragility. Some of the smaller pieces can easily fall off - especially the above-mentioned claw/gargoyle roof corner pieces. I actually had one fall off when I took the completed model to a lunch with a Korean companion (fortunately the set was bagged so I didn't lose the piece).</li><li>The model base. Honestly the ""Sungnyemun"" label on it doesn't do anything for me. Koreans use their own script, though proper names, especially of older buildings like this, can also be written in Chinese characters; the name should've been in the native script alongside the Romanized name. (Same applies for any other Architecture sets from countries where non-Roman scripts are used, such as Burj Khalifa.)</li><li>Playability. Obviously with the Architecture line, there is none. These are strictly static display models for grownups - kids need not apply. (However, I have an online friend, an American in Seoul, who would like a minifigure-scaled model of Sungnyemun, and suggests populating it with minifigures of South Korean politicians and protesters.)</li></ul>
<p>I have fallen in love with the Architecture line, and Set 21016, Sungnyemun, really sealed the deal for me. Today it looks awesome next to the Big Ben set, which I eventually also obtained, and I have one small bookshelf that is solely dedicated to my Architecture collection. Looking forward to more.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,1,3
