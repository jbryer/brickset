The Jet ski is basic but works well and has clips to hold the diver fins and spear gun while being driven plus a light on the side. Also no stickers as the dive logo is on the brick.

I really enjoyed playing with this set and going on dive adventures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-26T05:56:04.857Z","Mini Jet Ski","This line brings memories back. Driving my mum, dad, gran and pop nuts to go get fuel so I could got one of these. I think I am only missing one but I might have them all I will have to keep looking.

This particular one is number 2 in the collection. It is a small read jet ski, with a hook for flippers on one side, a clip for a spear gun and a light on the other. The front piece's logo is printed on, NOT a sticker, so it makes the piece rare. This is the only set you can get it in I believe.

The mini-fig is a female, which is a nice change. Dressed in blue and black all over and a white divers tank makes her really look good. She also has the snorkel mask not just a plain visor.

Overall its a nice little addition to any town or beach set and is a good one just for display. I feel this model holds a 5/10 easy and recommend this one too.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-06T12:25:36.687Z","Cool jet ski","This little promo set have usable and don't usable pieces. The front red piece is the same of the front of the set 6437 Beach Buggy, but the symbol make this piece no much usable. The third promo have a female minifigure too. The dive acessories are cool, it can be used in space sets too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Pika260","2009-04-29T16:02:09.217Z","Ha! First set Ever!","This set was my first set EVER! Im 15 now and I got it when i was a little kid. This set made me love LEGOs! i have hundreds of sets and this was my first. More into a review, The boat is practical and Easy to build, the assesories are very cool. The minifigure is great because it shows all of the parts to a minifigure. Something in its hand, around it's neck, on it's head, and on its feet. Just a great Classic Set (and my first!).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DrFrankenstein","2020-04-09T02:12:32.62Z","Fun promo set","<p>The jet ski scuba ranger is the second mini set from a 10-set Shell promotional collection handed out at gas stations in 1998. It is approximately equivalent to the modern polybag promotional sets in scope and intend. Similar to a polybag, the instructions are printed on a foldable sheet, and all the bricks come in a single bag. The one notable difference is that the set comes in a neat small cardboard box that enhances its appeal as a gift. The back of the instructions sheet contains an overview of all the Shell promo sets of the year. With one or two exceptions, the common theme among the group appears to be the dominant color scheme (red and yellow after the Shell corporate logo color scheme) and the scene of a minifigure commandeering a single-pilot contraption of sorts.</p>

<p>At 22 pieces, the build is over in the blink of an eye. The parts are mostly common town parts from the late 90s encountered in a number of other sets. The diver and the main red brick have been customized with dolphin logo print unique to this set. There is no parts inventory list printed on the box or instructions, which is to be expected for a set of this era.</p>

<p>The finished model looks good overall with a pleasant slightly over the top color scheme. The scuba girl&#39;s white cylinder and yellow fins accentuate nicely her blue-black wetsuit. The jet ski has a few neat touches - accessories hooks and holders, a one yellow headlight on the starboard side. A rounded flat brick attached to the keel allows the vessel to be positioned in slightly nose-high attitude or in a banked turn on a flat surface, which is cool.</p>

<p>The dolphin logo implies that the diver is part of an aquatic animal rescue organization of sorts. However, it&#39;s hard to imagine a fully geared diver riding jet ski in the real world for the simple reason that she would have very hard time not loosing her balance and getting tossed overboard with a heavy cylinder on her back. Also, it&#39;s strange that the scuba girl sports a huge spear gun on a rescue mission. I imagine it could be a tranquillizer gun, but it&#39;s not clear what good it would be when she has no room on the jet ski to transport a sea mammal. Perhaps she is a spy girl in a chase scene, but then the dolphin logo would not make sense. Or maybe she is an armed environmentalist on a mission to stop big oil from destroying the ocean (which would be ironic, since the set is sponsored in part by Shell)? Either way, best not to overthink the scenario in the set...</p>

<p>Overall, 2536 is a fun little set that strikes a bit of 90s nostalgia and provides a glimpse into the promo sets of the time. I wouldn&#39;t say that it stands out on its own in a town theme due to lack of a coherent story, but the diver girl would fit fine in other diver sets and the bricks from the jet ski could be reused in other builds. A pretty decent promo mini set.</p>
