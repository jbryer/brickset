 a charity called Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.&nbsp; For every ""free"" 
Lemonade Stand set built at the one day event, The LEGO Group donated 
one Dollar to the charity raising money to help fight childhood cancer.</p><p>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7164/6818555013_5b70b370de_n.jpg[/img]</p><p>The
 set includes 17 pieces: 13 pieces to build the Lemonade Stand, a cat, 
sticker sheet, and 2 Friends Logo printed 2x4x3 bricks.&nbsp; It also 
includes 1 instruction sheet with the 9 building steps depicted on the 
front &amp; back.<br><br>The set also came with an exclusive Friends 
Valentine's Day card sheet of 6 different cards, and a Friends 
Introductory ""Special Issue"" 16-page Magazine introducing the core 
Friends character MiniDolls: <br></p><p>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/6822319289_a02998e12a_n.jpg[/img]<br><span></span></p><p><br>There was a 
table set-up for girls to build the Lemonade Stand in the store; they 
were then given the Friends Logo bricks -- one has the word ""Best"" 
printed one side, and the other has the word ""Friends"" printed on one 
side; both have purple butterfly silhouettes, as well as the ""LEGO 
Friends"" Logo on the reverse side.<br><br>This is a fun little set to 
get more girls building with LEGO bricks.&nbsp; It was well-received at the 
TRU store I attended.&nbsp; Dozens of parents with their daughters were 
looking over all the sets before and after building the Lemonade Stand.<br><br>The
 core set is a nice addition for any LEGO builder as it has the 1x6 arch
 brick, as well as 2 brown telescope elements.&nbsp; The cat appears to be 
Mrs. Norris.&nbsp; The sticker sheet contains a LEGO Friends Logo, a Lemonade Stand sign, Lemons, 
Flowers, Butterflies &amp; bricks.<br><br>Even as a very first LEGO set 
for some girls, it is cute and can be re-built into other things.&nbsp; The store I attended 
had all the pieces gathered into a thick-plastic ziploc bag; the Friends
 Logo bricks came in a sealed bag from TLG with a paper insert of 
Friends graphics.<br><br>The Lemonade Stand is a step up in give-a-way items, which are usually just a Logo brick.<br><br>Exclusive Valentine's cards as part of this set:<span></span> <br></p>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6818536737_4e84c44580_m.jpg[/img]<br><br><p>The Reviewer is a grown-up girl fan of LEGO.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,5
