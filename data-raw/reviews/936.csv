As we all know, male figs are running rampant through LEGOland. It would have been nice to get a female hair piece to complete the female look instead of a baseball cap but the head itself is what makes this fig a lady. The accessories (oar, backpack, axe, life jacket, dynamite bricks and walkie talkie are numerous for such a small set. There are 7 accessory pieces out of the 19 pieces that come with the set. I love the simplicity of this set and the fact that there are brown bricks and a female fig. Of course with the small size of the set there aren't many bricks to speak of but it was a promo set so what do you expect? The Shell promo sets as a whole are a great buy because they all come with a fig (except for the Technic motorcycle). I rate this set a 3 out of 5 when compared to non-promo sets but just looking at the other Shell promos, this is a high scorer, perhaps the best set in the series (this or the red race car). Thanks again Tim!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2008-02-26T19:41:08.56Z","Hand Made Raft","This line brings memories back. Driving my mum, dad, gran and pop nuts to go get fuel so I could get one of these. This is the 9th one I have found so either I am missing No.1 (little red race car) or I haven't found him yet. Will continue the search.

This particular one is number 3 in the collection. It's a raft, which I found great as I only had one other raft (6665) and it looks nothing like this one. The raft is brown giving the impression it is made out of wood and has a place to clip on your backpack and tools while paddling. It comes with two sticks of dynamite, a hatchet, radio, oar and a solid one-piece backpack.

The mini-fig is quite cool for two reasons, one she is a girl and females are few and far between in LEGO, unless you bought Paradisa. Two, she has the extreme logo on the front and back of her shirt, making her more than just part of the town collection but part of the X group as well. She is dressed in dark grey pants, black jacket, yellow life vest and a blue cap. Her face is a pair of eyes with eyelashes and red lips.

One funny thing I noticed is the raft is all brown like wood, she is carrying dynamite and a hatchet. Very resourceful and fits in well with the whole extreme line. Not helping nature much thou :P

Overall I am quite happy with such a simple set as it can add a bit to your LEGO town. Different colours and figs are always a good thing, plus lots of accessories to boot. I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average leaning towards a six. Not a must have but a good one, if you can get it at the right price.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-25T10:08:00.48Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Extreme Team Raft Review","This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers as well. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to maneuver it. We get some nice accessories and I also like the design of the minifig we get in this model. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"clundsberg","2011-05-04T13:13:27.017Z","Dy-no-mite!","<p>Neither an exciting set or build.&nbsp; The ""extreme"" part of this rafting set must be the random sticks of dynomite which seem out of place both in a water environment and on a splintery wooden raft.</p>
<p>As I mentioned - a very quick and easy build.&nbsp; Very clunky raft - the basic rectangle shape seems rather boring.&nbsp; They could have done more with the space alotted me thinks.</p>
<p>I still have a fondness for these cute little Shell packages and if nothing else you get some dark brown legos and quite a few accessories for the mini-fig.</p>
<p>The mini-fig is the best part of this set.&nbsp; She has lots of accessories (lifevest, hat, backpack, dynomite x2, paddle, axe and walkie talkie) no hair printed on the lego head which could have added to her painted lips and eyelashes.</p>
<p>I did not really have any legos from the x-treme series, so perhaps surrounded by other sets she might make more sense. </p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,3
"Wipipi","2017-06-18T23:15:55.697Z","Very Nostalgic!","<p>This set is one of my favorite sets, purely for nostalgia. I remember buying it in stores and having a lot of fun with it when I was younger. But, I also think this is a great set, and here is why.</p>

<p><strong>-Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>TNT printed pieces!</li>
	<li>Old brown parts!</li>
	<li>Very cheap, I bought it in the stores for $2.50 new! Now it is worth about 10.</li>
	<li>Great fun to play with!</li>
	<li>Could be used as an escape raft. Maybe the rider was stranded on a deserted island?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Collectors won&#39;t really have a use for this, unless they&#39;re collecting Extreme Team sets.</li>
	<li>Really small, but that&#39;s because of the price.</li>
	<li>Some people don&#39;t like any shell promotion products.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, I do think this is a great set in all. Even though it doesn&#39;t really fit my vintage town setting, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find a way to fit it in. I&#39;ll give this a 9/10!</p>
