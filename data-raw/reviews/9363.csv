"Buckbrick","2012-10-10T02:45:19.28Z","Another worthy entry to the Architecture line","<p>I am always like a kid on Christmas day when an Architecture set is being announced and finally released for sale. And not just any set, but&nbsp;sets of&nbsp;buildings by the modern masters. Truthfully, I'm more excited over these sets than I am say the modular buildings. I own and love the Falling Water (Frank Lloyd Wright), Robie House (Frank Lloyd Wright) and Farnsworth House (Mies Van Der Rohe). All are large, detailed and simply stunning masterpieces in brick. These sets literally sparked my interest in architecture designs of that decade. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now Lego has finally released an architecture icon of Bauhaus master Le Courbusier! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Packaging:</p><p>The packaging of the Architecture line is unrivalled even within the Lego product line. Quality paper, card stock along with superb high-res printing are used. Surprisingly, the box is alot larger than the Farnsworth house and the piece count is a mere 120 more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The binding of the&nbsp;instruction manual is&nbsp;similar to the ones in the Farnsworth and Robie sets.&nbsp;Miraculously, it manages to stay open without having&nbsp;to press it down, thereby creating an ugly gash right down the spine.&nbsp;Like eveybody else, I wish it were spring bound like the one we got in Fallingwater. The instuction manual also includes a brief essay, details and floor plans&nbsp;of the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parts:</p><p>This set contains 660 pieces, largely in white, dark green, black and a smattering of red and blue that is used for the foundation. And of course there are those wonderful trans 1x2 tiles that we always get with these sets!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building:</p><p>The building is straightforward plate-on-plate, brick-on-brick build, with very minimal SNOT for the roof. There is no interior per se, but the roof is pretty detailed. The set is pretty large. The square&nbsp;baseplate is 3 plates thick and sturdy. It does bow up when the 2nd layer is built, but it flattens out nicely when the 3rd layer and finally level one of the building is built.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The finished building:</p><p>Simply beautiful! How&nbsp;stunning can Lego get? Go get&nbsp;one now! Thanks for reading! :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As they say, pictures say a thousand words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8322/8019466556_a6e4ba6135.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8318/8019466748_034d92a43a.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8320/8019466058_552a6418cb.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8449/8019466216_94b63470ec.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/8019466384_d784850cc2.jpg[/img]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Group shot, sans Robie House.</p><p>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8176/8019465798_15d7169176.jpg[/img]</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,5,2,3

I don't own the set, but I've seen how it's built, and if it's as good as the real thing, this set is worth the money.",FALSE,5,4,5,3,2
"Tim_Johnson","2012-11-02T19:00:38.933Z","Its weakness is its strength!","<h4><br></h4><div>I think it's true to say virtually all AFOL builders disregard TLG's ""rules"" of appropriate model construction. Partly because that's fun, and partly because we don't know what most of them are! Another reason we build ""illegally"" is the desire to closely recreate&nbsp;the real world. This model doesn't break the rules, I'm sure TLG wouldn't have allowed <i>that</i>, but it sure does feel like it bends them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For me, buildings don't come more ""design classic"" than this, and model designer Michael Hepp has clearly done everything he can to match Le Corbusier's design principles and proportions within the System. The finished model is stunning and I'll keep it on display for a long time I am sure. The beauty has lived up to my high expectations of this set.</div><div><h4>Parts</h4><div>There is one dark green 1x3 plate; previously only available in three sets in the mid-2000s.&nbsp;Shame&nbsp;there weren't more. But there are seven dark green 1x2 plates; these also come in the other recent Architecture release, Sungyemun. If you missed out on Team GB minifigs, this has sixteen white lightsabre blades which form the famous columns that support the real building. Otherwise the parts are very standard. Obviously it's a great source of white, but the best aspect to the parts are the excellent quantities - eighty blay 1x1 tiles, sixty trans-clear 1x2 plates, twenty trans-clear 1x2 bricks and a total of thirty-eight 1x1 plates in white or blay. You can never have too many 1x1 plates in your life. An unusual thing about this set's parts is that there are a lot of large and small parts; less medium-sized ones than you'd normally expect.</div></div><div><br></div>I've been critical of the cost of Architecture models, as the parts are basic and you could easily pay less on Bricklink to get them. But as ever, the sumptuous packaging and presentation adds so much to the value and building experience. And the price per piece still works out lower than most licensed themes.<h4>Build</h4><div>It's a bit of a labour of love to build; at one point there are a series of steps where you build a tiled floor out of fifty-four 1x1 tiles! A real test for my OCD as I had to give up trying to align them perfectly after the first couple of dozen! The other couple of repetitive bits are fine though. The connection methods are all very straightforward, with just a little basic SNOT where needed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The main issue with the build is stability. You know when you're doing steps in a model and it all feels a bit flaky in your hands, but then a couple of steps later a new layer brings the stability back? It's like that step never quite comes with this model! The final step is to add the top half to the bottom; despite appearing straightforward it's actually tricky and a bit scary. They connect via the (much smaller) central core of the bottom half, with the top overhanging by 3 studs. With any other LEGO model you could confidently just press down, but here you don't know where to push... the top half and the base (which is made of 3 layers of plates) begin coming apart with that ominous squeaking noise. As we all know, layering several plates causes warping and my model still needs some tweaking to remedy it looking like it was built on a slight curve! Adding to that feeling of uncertainty are the rows of columns that (ironically) don't connect to the top of the model and have a couple of millimeters of give in their vertical positioning, so some tweaking afterwards is needed to get them looking connected.&nbsp;</div><h4>Verdict</h4><div>I've moaned a lot but you know what... I adore this model! My spidey-senses say TLG really would have liked something far more stable and surely took that as far as they could, but recognised what a stunning job Hepp has done at creating something&nbsp;faithful... and just beautiful. So I think they kinda let this one through for the sake of Art with a capital A. And I love them for that.</div><div><br></div><div>You might have noticed I scored this set low, except for overall rating. That's because it wins in categories we don't judge sets by here - creativity, realism, and 'stuff wot AFOLs might build thinking LEGO would never release it'. It's pretty unusual in that respect, even within the Architecture range, and is something I always hoped for from these ""adult sets"" when I came out of my Dark Age. It'd be pointless to give it to a child or an impatient teenager (or adult). If you like Modernist buildings and are prepared to embrace the wobbliness (and attach fifty-four tiles imperfectly), I recommend it highly.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,2,2,1,3

It is very simillar to original building, all the details are perfect.</div><div>Building experience is great; there are many little parts, which makes building hard but experience is unique. There are many stairs, doors, windows and meanders. AS in real house. So thank you, Lego for giving us this model of house, which was architected by Le Corbusier. There are 660 pieces in box and there are no numbers on pockets so building is a great challenge. Price isn´t very good but, we get really good model, which have license. I cannot say, that the model is very playable, because it isn´t.
