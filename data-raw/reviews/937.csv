This particular one is number 4 in the collection and a real treat if you are a castle collector. This little cart is slightly wider than a normal mainly due to the wheels, but I have found this makes it so much steadier. It is armed with duel flame throwers on the front making it excellent for close range attacks or keeping the treasure in the barrel behind it safe (Treasure not included). Also it has a spot for a bat to sit up front, adding to the theme.

The mini-fig has red pants, a gray shirt covered in chain-mail, Black open-faced helmet covering the nose and the face has a lot of black facial hair. He is also armed with a crossbow. 

Overall I really like this model, it has great aesthetics, little playability by itself but can really bring something to your castle collection. I feel his model is a 5/10 and can easily hold it's place with other non promo models. I would recommend it to any castle collector or promo collector. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I rate it 5/5, for the same reasons of the others promotionals.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
