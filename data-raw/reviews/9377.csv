"PsyKater","2012-12-05T07:10:50.723Z","Nice little gift","<p>This little set was a little give-away for the 30th Birthday of TLG in Aug 2012. It was included in every order over 50 USD in Northern America, resp. 55 EUR in Germany. In UK it was not available until Brickset achieved a special offer: It was included for orders above 25 GBP with the code ""CAKE"" during Oct 2012.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Free give-away</li><li>some nice parts like the blue baseplate (unique), the reddish-brown slope and the dark-red teeth</li><li>can be used as birthday present</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not many parts (24)</li><li>Easy build (at least the front is SNOT)</li></ul>
<p>I had some problems at first, recognizing it as a birthday cake. But later on I realized that it is most probably meant to be piece of a cake - to be more precise - of a sheet cake.</p><p>After all, I am happy that I did not miss it, as it is a wonderful memento of TLG's 30th birthday. With objective eyes it is nothing special though. A birthday set from TLG could have been bigger.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,1,5
