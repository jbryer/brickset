"Novelty","2007-05-23T08:21:10.93Z","Grand Admiral","This is another small flying vehicle and although again it seems like a collection of spare parts, this one actually looks better than the other vehicle that's powered by the crystal ball.  However, it still has the flames shooting out the backside which makes it look weird and the bat is now attached to a staff instead of free flying.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-30T09:05:38.153Z","Another review of promo sets","This is another review of promo sets that i have. It looks like the other promo, with few pieces, but these pieces are more useful and the fright knight minifigure coolest than others. I don't have fright knights sets, only promos, but i think that make more sets of they cn sell more than new castle. The fire pieces on the back of machine can be usd in some lego sets. The wings to make beasts, the bat, to castle itens, the silver sword to invetory, and the staff like piece for laser shots, weapons, and lightsabers.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-01T18:57:16.327Z","For When Your Dragon Escapes...","This line brings memories back. Driving my mum, dad, gran and pop nuts to go get fuel so I could got one of these. I think I am only missing one but I might have them all I will have to keep looking.

This particular one is number 5 in the collection. It is a small aircraft one of two that were in the series and both were promotional. The design is quite simple but yet looks quite good. Consisting of 23 pieces 16 being the model it dose do itself justice. It's wings are the black dragon wings and it is propelled by the flames coming out of the back. The vehicle has no controls for steering so I would be assuming either the magic staff he is holding or some other form of magic power.

The mini-fig is Bat Lord. He is in his usual dress of grey pants, black belt, red top with black sleeves and a pattern on it. He also has the black bat shaped helmet. His face is a frown with a fringe, eyebrows and moustache. In this set he also come with the silver sword which was a mint piece when I was a kid. Also he has the &quot;Magical Bat Staff&quot; which basically consists of a See-through red pole with a bat on the top. Very basic kind of lame but an awesome accessory because it was different.

Overall This is quite a good set for a cheep promo and doesn't have any flaws. The fact it was a limited release makes it that much better if you own one. As usual with these small set the playability on it's own isn't too good but the aesthetics are up there. Overall I feel this model is a 6/10 or just above average as it has a few cool features but still nothing overly special. Would definitely recommend to a Fright Nights collector or anyone who like Castle sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Cult_Of_Skaro","2012-02-26T15:13:09.82Z","2539 Flying Machine","Please ignore my VFM rating, as I got this for free from a friend. On to the set. The box is, I think, quite nice, with some CGI cliffs in the background.The model itself is less exciting. It's first and foremost completely random for a Castle set. I'd much rather have a nice, simple, carriage or something. The build's rather flimsy. However, the minifig&nbsp;and the parts are quite nice for such a small set. I've always thought Basil the Bat Lord was cool, and was happy to get my hands on him. Also nice were the black wings and the chrome silver sword.
