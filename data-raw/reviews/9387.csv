It is a blue menace because I had to collect it and I always get distracted looking at it on my keyring or back pack. The only problem with this set is that watto&#39;s&nbsp;wings are made of rubber like in the set and they are at risk and have bent for me and I had to replace him. But other than that it is a really nice collectible for any Lego fan.</p>
