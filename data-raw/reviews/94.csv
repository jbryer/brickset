You can really appreciate the beauty of the vehicle once finished. It's larger than I had anticipated and looks great. The scale is different that the X-Wing and TIE Interceptor but still looks great beside them. The details are fantastic and there are a few things on the ship that you can manipulate: canopy, airbrakes (upper and lower), and rear gun. Obviously, the main color used is white, but the use of grays, blacks and oranges are nice for the highlights.

The one drawback are the use of stickers. This is a personal preference, but I prefer printed bricks than stickers.

Overall, this is a fantastic set and a good addition to the UCS line. But of course, how can you go wrong with the UCS sets??

"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-03T09:42:39Z","Not the best UCS model but still, its got its good points","I like it, but, its not as good as the other UCS's:

PLUS 
*how big this? V E R Y   B I G
*Look at all those useful pieces
*Lots of cool features. eg. the opening cockpit, the moving harpoon gun

MINUS
*it just lacks soething, i don't quite know what but it is missing somethig
*Personally, i think it should have been light grey, but i'll admit that is a matter of opinian

YES IF...
You want all the UCS models 

NO IF... you don't have a big enough wallet for all of the UCSs, get a &quot;rebel blockade runner&quot; that will satisfie you more

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-19T05:14:24Z","Very worthy to buy it in Singapore!","This is my first UCS set. I bought it 4 days ago at the price around USD75 from Bricksworld (located in Singapore, the lego exclusive shop). It is the only special offer in Asia as to celebrate Bricksworld 1st anniversary.

I like the colour combination of white and orange. The only problem is I always get confused with the dark grey bricks and black bricks while I was building the set.

Hopefully the Tie-Collection set and the Cloud City set will be available in Asia (Singapore) soon. Really can't wait to have them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-08T08:51:25Z","Heavy","Once again i was able to check out the finished product on display at my local lego store before i parted with my money - 110 GBP. The model is very accurate and detailed and takes a while to build due to the enormous number of parts - i had about 3 sessions to finish it. The detailed interior is good - especially the clever way the seats are constructed it is hard to believe they are lego. It all goes together well, but the front does not look exactly right - it is too long. Inspired by a modification on the brickshelf site i believe i have rectified the main weakpoint of the model and produced a better looking more accurate front end. The wings could be attatched a little more strongly as mine had a tendancy to keep falling off during construction. Stickers are fine and necessary in a couple of case where colour changes are needed that could not be achieved by using speparate bricks. When finished the thing is huge and very heavy and i was concerned as to how stable it would be sitting on the stand. It does sit on the stand, but it does seem to be at the limit of the weight it will hold. For parts this set is good value. It only gets a 9 though due to the front end which could (and should) have been done more accurately. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T20:15:45Z","Great looking model, just not quite there.","I couldn't figure out whether the canopy was too small or the nose too long - in the end, I decided it was both.  The scale is excellent except for those two points.  

I thought that the tail harpoon could have been done better, given the scale of the model (a bit more integration with the rear window).

The seats inside the cockpit are very cool and the laser cannons are very nicely done also.

Other than that and some stickers which go across multiple  bricks (a big downside for me) it's an excellent model and  one I can highly recommend. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"gratefulnat","2007-10-20T17:15:01.717Z","UCS Rebel Snowspeeder","This was my third UCS model and I loved it right away. It is an absolutely exciting model to build with no repetitions (ok, except for the wings), although it wasn't all that challenging. The cockpit interior is just great - I had never seen such attention to detail before in a lego model. I'm not a Star Wars purist so I don't worry whether the model is exactly like it should be (the nose isn't quite right).

The display stand works very well, and the Snowspeeder can be placed on the stand which ever way one desires.

For Lego fans of larger models all I can say is the is the real thing - fun fun fun :). For collectors of Star Wars Lego - get it if you don't have it.
