This line brings memories back. Driving my mum, dad, gran and pop nuts to go get fuel so I could got one of these. I think I am only missing one but I might have them all I will have to keep looking.

This particular one is number 7 in the collection. As you may have already noticed, it is really just a smaller cheaper, promotional, version of the original Sam Sinister;s car, but still a nice little model.

Not much playability with the model by itself but the aesthetics are good and when added with another model or two you can have alot of fun.

Sam himself comes with a pistol, has the hook hand and usual safari getup on.

Overall it's a promotional model and you get what you pay for, but still a good model that is a 5/10 and suits in with any adventure collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

For me, it have rank 5/5 because it is  rare. I have two of this minifigure, and i mixed with others, using they in my other adventurers sets. With the car is possible create little transports to city sets.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
