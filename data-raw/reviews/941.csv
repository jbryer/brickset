Lets start with the basics; It comes with Harry and the terribly small plane... I built it in about 1 minute {or less} The playability of this set is not so good and it lasted a few days before it was dumped into the rest of my lego bricks...The propellor is now part of a robot and well anyway all in all a puny set that lacks playability I gave it a three cause I got it for free...

This particular one is number 8 in the collection. As you may have already noticed, it is really just a smaller cheaper, promotional, version of the original biplane in the series, but still a nice little model. I found it makes a good personal, scout or rescue plane.

The plane itself is very basic for a whole 19 pieces including mini-fig and can be built in well under a minute, but hey for a promo model what do you expect? Color scheme is consistent with the Desert series and fits in nicely.

The mini fig is the usual flying guy in black pants, brown jacket and helmet. He has goggles for flying and his face is kind of a smirk with stubble. The model by itself has next to no playability but when added in with the others from the shell line or the others in the desert series it gets allot more.

Overall its a very simplistic model and I feel it rates in at a 5/10 just. Would have been less but it is a promo and as I said before what can you expect. Really I find this model a little plain and can honestly say if its cheap get it if not don't stress over it as your not missing much.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The wheels i use to make little cars, and the wings to space creations. The propeller is small but it can be used in various creations themes.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_fan_","2018-12-22T15:15:08.477Z","Great little plane","<p>This is a really cool little air plane for the money. I think it comes with a good selection of parts and a good minifigure. I really like the pilot jacket torso and helmet. The plane itself is about I would say by looking at it about 2 inches long and I find myself picking it up a lot. I would highly recommend this set to any Adventurers&nbsp;fans out there and ones that like collecting planes, Or Lego in general.</p>
