I got it used from my great Aunt&#39;s children, so I don&#39;t know where they got it. On the box, it says that it is a LEGO&reg; Basic set that is a &quot;Special Trial Size Offer.&quot; I am not sure what that means. Brickset&nbsp;says that it was a normal retail set from 1989, so I don&#39;t know it this set was only out for a limited time like the LEGO City&nbsp;3222&nbsp;Helicopter and Limousine set or if it was just a marketing scheme to sell the set.</p>

<p>Anyway, the set came with 44 bricks and pieces that kids could build anything with, much like today&#39;s LEGO Classic set. The best pieces in my opinion were the old&nbsp;propeller and helicopter tail rotor holder pieces. I also like th less common yellow&nbsp;1 x 2 printed brick with Three-Dot Face Pattern. The rest of the pieces are more common pieces that you can find in other sets.</p>

<p>This set, being a basic set, has some build suggestions on the box for younger kids who are just getting into the system bricks. It is a god set in that aspect and is a good set for older builders wanting to gt more common pieces.</p>
