Driving my mum, dad, gran and pop nuts to go get fuel so I could got one of these. I think I am only missing one but I might have them all I will have to keep looking.

This particular one is number 9 in the collection. This is one of the best ones from the shell series. Mainly due to the extras that make the model. It consists of a whole 18 pieces including mini-fig but that doesn't make it any worse. The vehicle itself is very basic but interesting and different. Lots of angles and odd shapes make it look spacey. Also it has the fluorescent aerials, studs and booster at the back.

The mini-fig is an alien, I know, shocking. He has red pants and arms, with a gray vest, which has alien patterns on it. The head is fluro orange and looks quite cool. The helmet is black and the same style as the rest of the series, which I never liked as a kid, I felt they were too flat on the top but looking at them now I can see how cool they are.

Overall I like this model and feel it is one that can really add something to the main series.  Good aesthetics and good playability when combined with any other model. A good 6/10 on this one and I would recommend this one as a good addition for any space collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Good for make space and minifigure creations, but it is very rare. the pieces are cool to make weapons, like a great lightsaber. I use various of these pieces to make robots, batlle machines and spaceships.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set ain't bad at all, even for 18 bricks.The alien was really cool it has an orange clear head, awsome grey vest and some red pants.

The ship itself i GREAT for a little set like this,it has:

green laser guns
booster
cool-looking seat
somewhat classic UFO shape

"Cult_Of_Skaro","2012-02-26T15:27:31.473Z","2543 Spacecraft","Please ignore my VFM rating, as I got this for free from a friend. On to the set. The box is lovely, big green planet in the background, which I assume is the planet of the UFO aliens. However, this is not up to the standards of the other UFO sets, for several reasons. First of all, it's more of a floating chair than a spacecraft. Okay, I take that back. It's a <i>heavily armed</i>&nbsp;floating chair. Second of all, I fail to see how the poor fellow's staying alive in the icy cold, soul-sucking blackness of space. He has none of the armor worn by his peers in the rest of the theme, and the ship has no protection. This ship might make since in an alien city , but not in deep space. The minifigure,&nbsp;however, is the best I've seen in these Shell promos. He has an awesome head, trans-neon orange with printing (&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/3626bpx76.jpg"">http://www.bricklink.com/PL/3626bpx76.jpg</a>&nbsp;) and chest printing showing his spacesuit. I especially love his helmet mold, which is designed so he appears to have large teeth and evil, slanted, eyes. For this minifig alone, I have given this a 3-star rating.<div><br><div><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Price/Parts ratio:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;No Comment.</span></div><div><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Parts Selection:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;7/10</span><br style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; ""><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Minifigs:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;9/10</span><br style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; ""><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Construction:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;2/10</span><br style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; ""><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Design:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;0/10</span><br style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; ""><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Swoosh Factor:</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">&nbsp;5/10</span><font face=""'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif""><span style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px;""><b><br style=""text-align: justify; ""></b></span></font><strong style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">Final Score: </strong><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; "">4.6</span></div></div>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,1
"Stud_Sensei","2021-09-13T11:19:21.373Z","Among the best of the Shell Promos","<p>&quot;Spacecraft&quot;.&nbsp;Could there be a less inspired name for a set in the Space theme? Yet, despite this, <em>2543 Spacecraft </em>stands out among the Shell promo line of 1998, sporting a brilliant, unique minifigure and some useful parts inside its well-styled box.</p>

<p><em>2543&nbsp;</em>was the only set of this run to belong to the Space theme, with most others belonging to the Adventurers, Extreme Team or Dragon Knights themes. And not just any space theme, but UFO - one of the many late 90s single run themes that had inspired art direction and excellent character scuppered by the use of large, gimmicky pieces and hit-or-miss sets.&nbsp;Somehow,&nbsp;<em>2543</em>&nbsp;is the best-designed flying craft of any of the &#39;tiny&#39; sets of the theme, and considering its minfigure, may be the best buy of any below&nbsp;<em>6900 Cyber Saucer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build-wise, the set is unremarkable, like any number of sub &pound;3 sets of the time; you could probably put it together just based on the box art. Nonetheless, the craft sports some nice parts - a tailwing, radar dish and a couple of trans-green antennae always have their uses - and the finished model is sturdy and swooshable, though the bulky seat piece and lack of controls does make the pilot look quite precarious on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main reason to pick this set up, then, is the figure. Though seemingly based on the &quot;Chamon&quot; figure from other sets in the line, as featured here the figure drops the bulky shoulder cauldrons and gains an all black, unprinted headpiece of the same fantastic mould so characteristic of the UFO line. Maybe this was an attempt to cut costs by TLG;&nbsp;a fraction of a fraction shaved off production costs by not printing on the helmet. Regardless, this is an excellent piece, improved by the all-black look, and extremely versatile, ideal for a sci-fi MOC of any sort. If you&#39;re looking to pick up any of the Shell Promos and aren&#39;t sure which set to grab first - make it this one.</p>
