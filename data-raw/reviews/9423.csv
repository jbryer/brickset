As stated in the handbook, ""Things are a little different here in Level 3. Instead of building three models in each kit, you'll create a star adventure model that you can rebuild into many springboard models to inspire or add to your next creation.""<div><br></div><div>The theme of Level 3, ""Adventure Designer"", introduces the ""Master Builder Academy Techniques"" of ""Story Building"" and ""Modular Building"" to the lessons of the preceding six levels. Like Kit 1, this first installment of Level 3 comes in a sturdy lift-top box, complete with sorting tray and enough room to store the pieces and Designer Handbooks for the rest of this level.<br><div><br></div><h4>Figure</h4><div>The exclusive MBA Level 3 minifigure, who will go on a perilous adventure through the three kits of MBA L3, features the same general design as his predecessors, emblazoned with the Master Builder Academy logo, this time in dark grey with orange accents, adorned with the number '3' in the circle at the very bottom.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Again, like previous editions, one predominant color from the theme (orange, in this case) is used on the torso, arms and legs, accented with white hands and hips. Like the MBA L2 figure, this one features the 'classic smiley' facial print, while the L1 figure has a more modernized version with brown eyebrows and white-accented pupils (though the promotional materials, Kit 1 box, and Designer Handbook displayed otherwise). I somewhat wish they had used different facial prints for each figure in the series, as I tend to favor the modern, more expressive faces. It would have given each one a distinct personality to go along with the theme of each level.</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Aviator Helmet</b> (reddish-brown) - Our orange adventurer wears the brown version of the old-timey ""aviator cap"" that can also be found in Kit 1 in black. It seems much more appropriate in this setting than in space.<br><br></li><li><b>Goggles</b> (dark stone grey) - The ""aviator cap"" just isn't the same without a pair of goggles to go with it.<br><br></li><li><b>""Invent-o-Pack""</b> (brick-built) - The Level 3 figure wears a brick-built magic backpack with mounting points for up to two frogs, because ""As every inventor knows, frogs generate more energy per square inch than any other object in the universe.""</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>The bulk of the parts for this set are comprised of various length 1-by bricks including standard bricks in white, dark reddish-brown and orange as well as technic and other modified bricks (1x1 w/horizontal clip, 1x2 with ridges, 1x1 w/1 stud on the side). Notable bricks are the two 1x1 trans-clear and two 1x1 trans dark-blue bricks. A smattering of large plates (4x4 up to 6x8) in black and reddish-brown and light stone grey are used for floors and roofs, while specialized pieces like various black conical parts, 1x1 round plates in orange, black and pearl gold, rounded-top windows, 1x4 arch bricks, and other small plates in reddish-brown, white, and light stone grey round out the collection. All in all, pieces generally used to build and adorn sturdy architectural structures, as opposed to the more 'organic' looking pieces from other MBA levels.</div><div><br></div><h4>Builds</h4><div><ul><li><b>Invent-o-Pack</b> - Much like the brick-built Jet Pack from MBA L1, Kit 1 this little build is none-the-less assembled using some intriguing building techniques. Of course the highlight here is the pair of powerfully magical frogs, held fast by a single 1x1 plate w/""lamp holder"" at the very top.<br><br></li><li><b>The Lost Village Inn</b> - Being the 'star adventure model' for Kit 7, this is the most elaborate build. Structurally very solid, this model is quite different from previous offerings in this line in that it is a minifigure-scale building. The front is lavishly styled to mimic timber-frame (sometimes referred to as 'Tudor' style) construction, with vertical and horizontal brown lines interspersed between white or orange portions of wall. Conical turrets, asymmetrical in height, adorn either side, while gold accents and a centrally-located trans dark-blue and clear ""stained-glass window"" round out the center. Though minifigure-scale, it's a rather small building and the taller tower doesn't have a second floor as one might expect, though the central part behind the window does.<br><br>With no side or back walls, no front door, a narrow footprint, and spartan interior, the building looks more like an elaborate set for a stage play than an actual building - which, I suppose, is somewhat fitting given the ""Story Building Technique"" concept. Since the ""Modular Building Technique"" is the second main lesson for Kit 7, the open sides are somewhat necessary in order to connect to the next kit from either side. The designers could have included a single removable wall that would cover whichever side is not connected to another module, however.<br><br></li><li><b>Door </b>(springboard model) - The first of three supplemental ""springboard models"", the door features a nicely constructed studs-forward door hinged on a frame of mainly brown 1x1 and 1x2 bricks, with a 1x6 arch forming the top of the doorway. It's simple, but that's the point - to act as a jumping-off point and get the creative juices flowing. The only issue I have with it is that the door doesn't reach all the way past the arch brick, leaving a gap at the top when closed.<br><br></li><li><b>Stairs</b> (springboard model) - With tiled steps and nuanced details such as round rear support columns and a stringer made of inverted 45Â° slopes instead of solid bricks, this build is elegant in its simplicity.<br><br></li><li><b>Drawbridge</b> (springboard model) - The largest and most elaborate of the ""springboard models"" from the handbook, this build evokes the look of medieval castle architecture, with a stone battlement across the top, the wide bridge and tall archway opening. Gold 1x1 round plates and torches are used as accents to give the build a bit of context as to setting.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><h4>Playability</h4><div>Unlike previous kits, where playability was inherent to the models (spaceships, airplanes, cars, robots, beasts), being a building, the dearth of interior details negatively impacts the playability of the set. Even compared to the least playable kit from Levels 1 and 2, Kit 2 ""Microbuild Designer"" still had multiple objects that could be played with (micro-scale cars, airplanes, space shuttles) amidst the more architectural elements.</div><div><br></div><div>The lone play feature in the entire build for Kit 7 is a ""golden crystal"" hidden behind a hinged cover. While the narrative states that the people of The Lost Village haven't been able to fix their town or build anything new since the wizard took their creativity, there should be more of a balance between telling the story and making the build playable. The addition of a front door, and a simple table and chair on the first floor, or bed on the second would have made all the difference.</div><h4>Printed and Online Materials</h4><div>As has been the case since Kit 1, the 84 page Designer Handbook is so much more than a mere instruction booklet. While it does give you the instructions to build the ""star model"" and three ""springboard models"" described above, it also has detailed call-outs throughout the build process to point out instances of the two main techniques of ""Story Building"" and ""Modular Building"", adding to the lessons with real-world examples along the bottom of each page. Meanwhile, spotlights on various aspects of modular building, storytelling through LEGO, and use of peculiar pieces such as the much beloved (in certain circles) LEGO Frog make the handbook an additional value to the set itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, departing from the standard of previous handbooks, this one obviously leans heavier on the narrative that unifies Level 3. The story, written by LEGO scribe Daniel Lipkowitz (""The LEGO Book"", ""DC Superheroes Batman Visual Dictionary"", ""Knight's Kingdom"" series) weaves the tale of the MBA L3 minifigure's journey through the swamp where he's looking for frogs to power his Invent-o-Pack and on into The Lost Village, where he finds a decrepit collection of buildings, the least decrepit of which happens to be the Inn. A hastily crafted sign reads ""Hero Wanted""...</div><div><br></div><div>The narrative actually continues on the MBA website with chapter two, wherein our hero-to-be learns of the reason for the state of The Lost Village, involving a wizard who stole all the creativity from the villagers and trapped it in three golden objects (it sounds a lot like the Maelstrom from LEGO Universe, to be honest). The website also contains a ""choose your own adventure"" style narrative starring our MBA L3 minifig, more spotlights on the themes of ""Story Building"" and ""Modular Building"", text and video interviews with Master Builders, quizzes, an online gallery of MBA member-submitted builds, as well as PDF downloads of seven more ""springboard models"" including three styles of window, a covered well, a fireplace, a tree and a throne with a segment of wall behind it.</div><div><br></div><h4>Conclusion</h4></div><div>In yet another departure from the first year of MBA, it appears that each new level will be a three-kit subscription that will span half a year, as opposed to the Level 1 &amp; 2 structure of a Kit 2-6 subscription (Level 2 starting at the half-year point with Kit 4) with Kit 1 being a stand-alone product not directly&nbsp;affiliated&nbsp;with the subscription. It appears that this half-year subscription will be the standard going forward, presumably with a new sturdy storage box at the start of each new level. This makes a lot of sense, as I found housing both Level 1 and Level 2 pieces and Designer Handbooks in the single box for Kit 1 a bit problematic.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While this does increase the over-all cost of a full-year subscription - Level 1 &amp; 2 costs $100 all-told when combined with the stand-alone Kit 1, whereas the Level 3 subscription costs USD $60 - the value remains the same. With a total piece count for Level 3 weighing in at 632 (229, 220 and 183 for Kits 7, 8 and 9, respectively) the ""golden ratio"" of $0.10/piece is already easily met. Add in the Designer Handbooks, the lift-top storage/sorting box and the online materials, and the value far exceeds that. Assuming Level 4 follows suit, even though the subscription for the second year of MBA would end up being USD $20 more than the first, it would easily match, and possibly outstrip, the value of the Level 1 &amp; 2 kits - especially with the probable addition of a second sorting box with Kit 10, which we didn't get with Kit 4.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
