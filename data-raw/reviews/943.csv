This particular one is number 10 in the collection. It is the only technic model of the series, so it is a little out of place but a cool little model for what it is. I mean ok, it is a very basic technic motorbike but it has a tail light, the back wheel is on a shock absorber, the front forks move in and the throttle on the handle bar twists.

Really on closer inspection I can't find fault with this model, even thou I was sure I would find one.

Overall it is a small cheap model but some time and effort went into designing it with all these features in under 25 parts. Overall I feel this one is a 5/10 because it's a cool little model and I feel completes the shell series nicely and is a cool little addition to any technic collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-09-13T16:11:29.293Z","Another great promo","I personally have eight of the ten promo sets, and most, if not all, are great sets. I found these at a store called &quot;Odd Jobs&quot; (befor it went out of buisness), and to me the store was famous for selling out of date items at dirt cheap prices (these sold for $1 a peice). This set in specific was one of my favorites, since it was a quick build (but for my age was still a challenge), was a cheap buy, and was really, really fun. This set was the &quot;Tech Deck&quot; of LEGOs, since it could be played with so easily and didn't lack any fun a standard &quot;fingerboard&quot; would have.

The rubber band system gives a shock effect on the wheels, so the bike could do stunts, plus the set, though simple in design, is still detailed having a tail light and a handlebar.
Overall, for technic fans looking for a challenge, don't look here.
BUT, for the Lego fan and the child who likes to have fun, this is a great choice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
