Granted, you couldn't get more girly, or more juniorized, if you tried, but for what it is, it's probably a really good set to get little girls started doing things with Lego.

Problemis, it doesn't really have enough pieces to build more than part of one room with, and has no real action elements to make it a lot of fun.  It made me wish that a Cat in a Hat would come rampaging into the small pink and green and white living room and stir up some mischief.  It needed at least one animal, at least one angry or playful looking person, and at least one piece that would move, or change, or do something other than just sit there.

I'd buy it again, but only to see if I could build something bigger with two of them.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
