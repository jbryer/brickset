Especially reviews about a magnet set, they're pretty plain and simple.<div><br></div><div>But if you're like me and every other star wars lover, you'd probably take the&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to buy one of these sets for the glorious figures they offer. As soon as I opened the packaging and was feeling around the figures, I was just mortified to find that Lego went ahead and glued these figures legs to the magnet piece, so they are completely&nbsp;inseparable&nbsp;from it. WHAT THE FRICK!?!? &nbsp;Who does that? &nbsp;I tell you who, a company who doesn't want the public to get good figures at reasonable prices. the head, hands, hat, arms, and weapons are the only pieces able to come apart, but what's a figure without a torso and legs?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>So if you're going to buy this set for the figures, you're out of luck. But if you like cool magnets to pin up papers on your fridge, then this set is for you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'm assuming the other set this year is like that, if not, someone should write a review for it (if there is a review already, then disregard that.) &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, this set is not ideal for figures solely, but if you actually use it for its intended purpose, then you are set.</div><div><br></div><div>pros:</div><div>cool figures</div><div>unique magnet?</div><div><br></div><div>cons:</div><div>cannot come fully apart</div><div>useless for figures</div><div><br></div><div>again.. Lego has outsmarted us..</div></div><div><br></div><div>UPDATE:</div><div>I have found a way to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;the figures from the magnets, Just need boiling water. Here's a link to a site that helped me.</div><div>http://thebrickblogger.com/2011/01/lego-glued-magnet-removal/</div>",TRUE,2,1,1,3,3
