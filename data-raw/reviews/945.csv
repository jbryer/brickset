Its baseplate is good, a little piece of road and some green. Overall I would recommend the formula 1 Ferrari shell release than this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For starters, it has the coolest set of tools and machinery one would want to see in a Lego pit stop display. The arm holding the ""line"" for the power tool that unscrews the car's wheels is just mind blowing in ingenuity and simplicity. And, not at all behind it, there is the mobile fuel pump with its own hose.

Secondly, this set is awesome because, well, because it is so small. Small and, yet, so full of detail - even for the best on Lego's tradition.

I just bought 6395 Victory Lap Raceway in eBay and you can count that this set will be added to that bigger one as soon as I get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
