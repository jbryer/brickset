<p>The box is not sealed in the traditional way. It can be opened via a flap that is held in place by a magnet. There are three spaces inside for Han Solo, Chewbacca and Boba Fett. Han and Chewie are glued and in the box. The parts and instructions for Boba Fett come in an additional Zip Lock bag.</p>
