WAA!&quot; I picked it up and put it next to the trash can. It blended right in. The garbageman picked it up. &quot;why'd you take it?&quot; my sister asked. He replied &quot;it looked like garbage.&quot;
This is a crappy girly set for five, six, and seven year olds. LEGO lost $ making this set. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"wipefeetnmat","2011-08-18T10:03:52.76Z","Cool pieces...","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is set that is really mostly for the pieces which are all really unique. The figures (which are made for girls) cant be incorporated into many other sets so they are a 'dead end' but some of the pieces like the cat, palm tree, swing, and basket are unique and can be only gotten in this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some pros and cons:</p>
<p>Pros: Unique pieces.</p>
<p>Cons: The figures are for girls and you can't use them in other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overal a decent set I give it a 3/5.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,4
