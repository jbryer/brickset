"faster345","2007-07-05T15:08:52.28Z","Great model of a 1996 Ferrari 310.","I bought this set back in 1999 from an F1 catalog. It cost quite a bit more than the original Shell promotion, but it is well worth it. I bought a second one in 2006 on eBay that Iâ€™m keeping in the box to give as a gift to one of my children in 10 or 15 years. I made a slight change on my display model in that I swapped black bricks for the red front and rear wings as seen in many races during the 1996 F1 racing season. I bought the extra bricks from the Lego online store. Cost about $7 but it makes a nice variation of the existing model. Cheers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T14:21:19.793Z","Ferrari, 1997","This set was released as a promo of the Shell petrol. The set is basically a ferrari formula 1 racing car in a medium size and Lego System style. The building is good, with some useful pieces like the red plates as the base of the car, too useful are the encurved red pieces, the blocks with original shape or also the white wheels, too used in some old technic sets. The design, as a result of the building, is nice and features some stickers, no much, to it still good. The size for the minifigure in the cockpit is good, but the minifigure can't reach the controls very well. The details like the encurved pieces  or printed symbols (ferrari, shell) and some other in the back of the car makes it aerodinamic. The playability is awesome, the wheels are in a good position and these runs fast in comparison with some other lego cars of these years. Altough this set not includes minifigures and some pieces are in a old style, this set is good in the building, also in the pieces, price (this is a promotional set that was released in the Shell petrol wolrdwide in the year of 1997), design and playability. This is one of the first ferrari lego sets and is like some of these, very good, overall.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T05:54:10Z","Wow, great set, but as with all model team sets: too many stickers","Like I said, great set but too many stickers.

For the price I bought it, I should have gotten two before the store that sold it went out of buisness (replaced by a different, not as good, dollar store. I got this for $20 back at Odd Jobs (when it still existed!) and I loved it from the instant I saw the engine. This was my first challenging set, since I had been forever limited to tiny sets... until now. This is one of my favorites, but somehow three of the parts mysteriously disappeared (probably fell of and lost while moving it into the basement, where I display my entire collection. As with all sticker sets, if the stickers are peeled off a certain way, and curl up, they tend to get dirt on them before they are applied, which means two or three years later the stickers peel and eventually like most older stickers, become fragile and shatter. The design of this set is sleek and it has plenty of parts, making it a collectors dream! The back has a portion that pulls out to reveal the detailed engine. The cockpit doesn't lack detail (especially with that seat!) and the car has it all. The fender and spoiler are to die for and the steering system works! With plenty of hot designs, this shows that Star Wars isn't the only series to have amazing collectors models!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Proteasome","2013-07-30T19:02:10.473Z","very decent set","I just finished rebuilding (for the i dont know how manyth time) this wonerfull car. I got it as a gift when i came out, and as a kid i was very happy with it, being a huge fan of F1 and lego. Although my love for F1 is a lot less, I really enjoyed building it again. As a kid, (and come to think of it, not only then) I really dislike stickers. stickers which cover one part are ok, i can live with that and i get it. but i really detest stickers that cover several parts, and with this set you get a lot of them. Not that I really care, I just dont apply them, and in my opinion they dont really add something anyway. otherwise, the build is the regular lego build, but you have to be careful not to go too fast, as the steps are quite big. over all I really liked it, even though there is not a lot of special things going on. I felt compelled to substract another brick from the score because of the stickers. <br><br>My parents were very consistent that i dont mix my lego sets, which was sometimes hard, because i could not use the parts to build what i wanted, but i am really happy now that they did, because after all these years, only 2 parts are missing (the grey crane and red clip that make a rear view mirror) <br>As for parts, I didn't get to reuse them in other sets, even though I might in the future, there are a lot of useful bricks (this depends on what you want to make of course). no special parts as far as i can tell, but a really nice printed nose. <br><br>playability is quite low, bit this is a show model, so who cares? the car does steer, but I would expect that from a model this size. because of that, any appropriate sized minifig (a technic one perhaps?) can not sit in the car, for there is no place to put his legs, but again who cares? this is, as thay say in holland f-ing ants. <br><br>now, the completed model, in my opinion it looks great. I really love the small wing like things on the side, and of course the engine, which is huge compared to other lego engines. naturally the red colour suits it, and it really is the image of the classic F1 car, as it is not really up to date any more. <br><br>all in all, I think it is a great set, and because of the lack of specific parts, there is a good chance you can actually build it with your own lego collection (maybe another colour? i think a black one would be really cool) <br><br>I hope my English is not too bad, hope this was usefull. <br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"Golden_pombo","2013-09-21T12:24:04.52Z","Magnificient piece in anyone`s collection of Lego (even if it`s only for admiration...)","<p>I bought this model in 1999, when I was working at a gasoline station. It was the first LEGO set I bought as a grown-up. It's a fantastic model - very similar to the real F1 car at the time. This set's only con is that it does not look good without stickers; the stickers really make the set look better.</p>

<p>But anyway, if you're thinking on getting a model like this one, don't hesitate. You'll be surprised and convinced that you have made a good buy - and you really did.</p>
