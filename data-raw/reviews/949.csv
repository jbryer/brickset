"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-11T01:15:14.733Z","Another Great Minifig","I really dig the black visor. I previously hadn't owned a 3-wheeler, so it was definitely worth buying for so cheap! 3.75! I'm happy. I also agree with the first review, having everything black is fun to messs around with. I replaced the head with a skull, he looks like ghost rider or something.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-08-19T13:36:25.427Z","Fun little kit.","Biker Bob may be a freebee, but he's actually pretty cool, despite his crazy 3 wheeled bike. The exclusive face is cool, what with the beard and the silver glasses, and I like his torso. And again, since the kit was free with my copy of Lego Creator, I can't really take more than one point off for the design. Of course, it's not worth buying it, but it's okay free. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nesquik","2011-09-19T13:42:41.25Z","Brilliant Biker Bob","Arriving as a nice free package within the 'LEGO Creator' CD-ROM box, 'Biker Bob' is another resident of the City who we all wish to know more about, but seems to hide away these days. I've always compared Bob to another character of the same name; Boba Fett from the Star Wars saga... Mysterious, and ultimately cool!<div><br></div><div>With just 18 pieces (minus the Minifig) this is a typical micro-set that you would expect to find in the 1990's with promotional offers or at any one of the LegoLand parks themselves. This makes sets such as this charming and unique - they're hard to find today, and I like the fact that the subject matter has so much playability and can be placed in any City.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifig of Bob himself is a big talking point as he has a very rare headpiece that features striking 'goatee' facial hair and equally nice sunshades, of which again, I have yet to see on another minifig. The torso has three zip patterns, whilst the hands and legs are plain black, as is his helmet.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As mentioned in another review, the flames coming out of the exhausts are a really nice touch and give the impression of great life within Bob's bike. I'd like to think that because of mysterious nature and the rarity associated with him that those flames hint at a very special bike...</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5

"Fauch","2014-11-28T23:21:59Z","Cool motorbike","<p><font face=""Rockwell"">I got this set for free with lego creator, so I can&#39;t really judge the value for money. Moreover I have no idea what it is worth today.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Rockwell"">This is the first and only lego motorbike of this kind I got. It looked really cool and I think it still looks pretty good compared to modern standard. I got my first motorbikes with the 1992 shuttle launching crew, but this one looks much more powerful, being bigger. Also, it&#39;s black.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Rockwell"">The minifig being entirely black (even the visor) was really cool back in the day, though I guess it&#39;s nothing special nowadays, except maybe the head piece which could be rare (I have no idea actually).</font></p>

<p>I recently found out something cool with this set. I was browsing random instructions on that site, and realized that the motorbike pieces in this set are used to build modern lego star wars speeder bikes. Actually, you can disconnect the front part of the motorbike with the wheel and handlebar, and instead you connect the front of your speeder bike. then you remove the 2 back wheels and use plates with clip on top to attach skis. I made my own with spare pieces, mostly pieces from the 1999 speeder bikes set.</p>

<p>Note that if you buy one of those star wars speeder bikes sets, be careful which pieces it comes with. it is possible it only comes with the back side of the motorbike, which would mean you can&#39;t actually turn your speeder bike into a regular motorbike.</p>
