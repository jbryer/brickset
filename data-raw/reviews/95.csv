"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-04T12:10:53Z","Why not “Y” instead of TIE blues?","It should be well known by now after all the speculation the set contains 2 (why?) original TIE fighters and Vader’s TIE Advanced as well as the TIE/D from the expanded universe. This makes the caption on the box “Original Trilogy Edition” even more puzzling as the latter never did appear in the original trilogy. The TIE and TIE Advanced have been released before and the only new model is the TIE/D. If like me you did not own the previous releases then the set could be worth it, but otherwise it seems a lot of money at 65 GBP for just one new model and some extra parts – unless you do want additional ones in which case fine. In my opinion they could have left out one original TIE and reduced the price, or as I would have preferred included the Y – Wing that was twice previously released with the TIE Advanced, or failing that something else like a new in scale TIE Interceptor. 

The (nice) box shows (as usual) the minifigs in this set as Vader, 2 pilots, but also includes the droid brain which it has to be said is merely a few normal bricks put together – hardly a minifig! The old models themselves seem the same as before with all their foibles (no point me adding to previous reviews really) including the blue bricks for detail etc, which I do not personally like. In my view they should be grey. However, given that Lego have recently produced blue/grey bricks/plates used on mini TIE Advanced and some other SW mini sets, the use of these would probably look best and would have made the re-released models in the set different in some way from those previously available. Still no pilot’s seats which would be better - headroom permitting, and no stands. I know from reviews there was one with the TIE before which most people did not like, but how do you otherwise display them – hang them from ceiling? I would prefer stands of some sort – I made one for my TIE Bomber – which also has all the blue parts replaced with grey and in my view looks much better for it. The design of the TIE/D is basically similar to the others and consequently has similar characteristics, but it does look quite impressive - perhaps because we are not used to it, and the cockpit is different from the rest. The “web” bricks on the TIE/D are not new and have appeared in several sets before – possibly just not in this colour.

Overall I think how you rate this set depends on your perspective. If you have the TIE and TIE Advanced already I would not bother just for the one model you do not already have. If you do not have any of them it is obviously better value, but even then I think you get a TIE too many and it should be left out with a resultant price drop or you should get something else instead – Y – Wing or possibly the TIE bomber or Interceptor.  Still think the blue bricks detract from the appearance. Overall I find the set a little disappointing from my own perspective so I can only give it a seven.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T05:36:44Z","Great set!!","I just receaved this set from Lego shop at home and love it, I loved it soo much that I decided to take a part all my system sets foirm 1999-2003 to dislpay it and the other 2004 sets, kinda like a new beginnning, anyway great set, The two regular Ties are alsmot identicle except for the fact that the wings are extended a bit and the top is different, Vaders tie is very different with blue tiles instead of stud plates on the wings, wings are extended, and the back of the ship is completely different, Tie droid whatever is really cool also, unique design and such, cool bricks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T08:49:36Z","Now I know why not &quot;Y&quot;","Just noticed that the Y – Wing has been re-released (September 04) with the TIE Advanced again as set 7262 – an exclusive on the lego shop at home site – so now I have part of my answer. From the pictures the latter seems to be of the original design (including those blue bricks again!) rather that the slightly tweaked version released in this set 10131. Hopefully I will be able to compare in a few days. Look out for further comments under 7262.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-15T00:37:34Z","Better than reasonable.","This was a highly anticipated set for me and I waited eagerly about 8 months for it. I reckon it's one of the coolest sets to come from the Classic range, and certainly the second coolest to come out this year, behind the Falcon.

I was disappointed that there is only a droid driving the Interceptor, given that they could easily have fit more stuff into it. This shows the typical lack of creativity that many Lego sets have. But nonetheless, I think this set is quality and I now have an awesome TIE fleet that the Rebels just won't be able to stand up to.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-24T10:19:49Z","Exactly what I was looking for!!","I love this set, it comes with 2 tie fighters, a tie advanced, and a TIE DROID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Personally I think that they should have included a tie interceptor instead of an extra tie fighter.  Then all you have to do is buy the tie bomber and have the complete army besides the expanded universe tie crafts.  Anyways as my usual score, I give it a 10/10 for being totally fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-26T20:31:50Z","Squadron 1!","          This set rocks so much! You get a load of TIE starfighters, which include the ordinary trademark, the TIE Fighter(This has the tall wings, there are 2 of these fighters in the set), the TIE Advanced, (The large one with the curvy wings and thick midsection (Darth Vader's one), and a TIE/d fighter. The /d is new but like, never in the movie. It has wings kind of like an Interceptor and is unmanned, its a UAV!. You can have some serious battles with this set, and although having the TIE family issue of weak attachment sections, this set provides super playability and can generate an awesome display or fleet! It has about 658 pieces and is $70 USD.  It is highly worth it, the TIE fighter family is always a best, and cant go wrong! This is a wopping 10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T17:44:18Z","NICE!!! (But 2 TIE Fighters?)","This is my first review, so bear with me.  I got this set for Christmas of '04 and I LOVE it!!!  The set contains four fighters, which I think is the record for individual &quot;sets&quot; in one set.  They all have swinging hatches, which is good, with the new dark stone color.  Vaders TIE has lots of space, but no controls and is WAY cooler than the other one.  And the TIE fighters are even better than the first one also.  But why two?  This set could have had a minifig scale TIE intercepter, but no.  The TIE drone (AKA TIE/D fighter) isn't even in the movies and it's AWESOME!  I really recommend this set.  I would give it a 10, but a TIE intercepter would have been a lot better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoMan384","2007-12-01T15:13:21.61Z","Good","This set comes with four tie fighters, 3 mini-figures and, 1 droid.  The ships are really good except the tie/d fighter.  It's not even from the movies!  I would give this set a 5 if they replaced the tie/d fighter with a tie bomber.  But I would say it's worth buying.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jack75","2009-07-11T15:26:13.857Z","Mighty Fleet of the Empire","I never got this set, but I have two TIE Fighters and Vader's fighter. Plus, I could easily build a TIE/d. I also love making my own TIEs, so I guess this is great if you are a MOCer or a big fan of the Empire. Though this is rather expensive, this is great for building up a fleet of TIE fighters.

Pros:
Two pilots and their fighters
Darth Vader
Vader's Fighter
TIE/d
Exclusive Droid Brain

Cons:
No Bomber
No Interceptor (Understandable because it wasn't made then.)
Droid Brain kind of cruddy.

"Taggerung1","2016-09-23T03:01:22.2Z","Special to me.","<p>When I was younger, I sunk probably hundreds of hours into the game Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for the N64.&nbsp; In it, you play as the regular Rebel ships, X-wing, A-wing, etc, against the regular Imperial ships.&nbsp; TIEs, Interceptors, Bombers, etc.&nbsp; Up until the last level, when they say &quot;Okay, now fly this thing called a V-wing, and fight against these highly aggressive TIE Droid Fighters.&nbsp; Also, World Devastators are here.&quot;</p>

<p>That level alone, I probably played more than a hundred times.&nbsp; Needless to say, all those ships became well known to me.&nbsp; And then, this set shows up, with not only a TIE X-1 that&#39;s way better than the one from set 7150, and TWO standard TIEs (which are unbeatable in a swooshing fight with your friends), but this TIE/d Fighter that is, for me at least, a dream come true.</p>

<p>I will say that for the TIE X-1, the newer set 8017 looks far better than the one seen here, if only for the reason of being the right colour.&nbsp; And the TIE Fighter in set 9492 is amazingly better than the relatively flimsy ones in this set.&nbsp; But, in the spirit of TIE Fighters themselves, sometimes quantity beats quality.&nbsp; Having a large number of fighters, especially as a kid who gets into epic battles with friends, is just the best.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was my friend who got this set.&nbsp; For a while anyway.&nbsp; He grew out of Lego and I didn&#39;t, so now I have it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I never had the box, but I assume it worked like a normal box.&nbsp; The instructions were good, in the old fashioned way of putting on more than one brick per page.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Black, blue, grey.&nbsp; Lots of it.&nbsp; All I ever really thought about the parts was after I took it all apart to rebuild (to make sure it was right) was &quot;Yes, these will once again become TIE Fighters.&quot;&nbsp; However, the blank version of the TIE window is pretty cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yay, another Darth Vader.&nbsp; I have more Vaders than I have Stormtroopers, and it annoys me.&nbsp; TIE Pilots are good, they do their job.&nbsp; Droid brain is.. a little meh, but what did you expect?&nbsp; Maybe a printed piece would have been nice.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Some people don&#39;t like repetitive builds.&nbsp; I personally love being able to build two of the same thing, at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While the newer TIEs look better in my opinion, I like that these ones match with the others of the time, like the Interceptor, Bomber and Crawler.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I give it 5 stars, because this is just a darn cool set.&nbsp; More TIEs than you can hold at once, means you&#39;ve got reinforcements, and each one can be better than the last.&nbsp;</p>
