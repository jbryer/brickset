Okay, so he's a bit cheesy, but I like the idea of the lego world having it's own unique superheroes, this being one of them. And the Timmy look-alike is fun, and has a face that's good for child minifigures in your town. Plus, it's free, so it's fine, if not spectacular. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The face is the same which I've seen in the LEGO Time Cruisers - Rocket Racer set: We get black hair, big eyes, and a small nose. This minifig is also unique and you can only find this guy in this set.<br><br></span><br></span><span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Handcar:</span><br><br>The handcar <span><span><span><span><span><span>is very easy to build and a nice starter set.
