"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-06T09:14:20Z","the best lego king ever","This has got to be one of LEGO's most shining moments.  Until recently when the Blacksmith shop was introduced, the kings ruby studed brest plate was one of a kind.  The minifig's face is also original and can only be found on robin hood's and that general from the western themed sets. The throne is awesome too. If bricklink is still selling them, I would highly recomend that you get one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T05:59:24.903Z","Dethroned","The Lego Chess PC CDROM was one of the first few Lego computer games available, and I think they felt that they had to include some plastic bricks with the CDROM.  This is the set that was included.  It's just a throne, with a king on it and a sceptre and a crystal.  It looks boring - the throne could have been grander, the design could have been better (those ugly black legs just looks wrong), the colours could have matched more.  As a set on its own, it's really disappointing.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"AddictedToStyrene","2007-09-26T08:14:51.983Z","What a big scepter you have, your majesty.","This is a great little kit - collectors will love it. I got one for $4 at a Kmart in Australia - I guess someone had returned a broken box and the kit had fallen out and been put with the rest of the Lego in the toy aisle. 
The throne is simple and classy. Not sure about the silver crystals, and the king looks great sitting there. Build a castle for him, or just have him preside over a joust. He's the king!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-20T16:47:41.717Z","One of the Lego kings","This set includes some few pieces and also one of the first Lego computer games, a lego chess. The game is old but the playability is cool, the same of a good chess. The set included with the CD rom is named &quot;The Crazy LEGO King&quot;. This is different from some of the other Lego kings and still in a cool design like others. The minifigure have a white staff with a &quot;crystal&quot; and also a gold painted crow, that makes a cool effects. The throne is also good builted, have useful pieces and looks like great for a throne. It also includes a crystal like the crystals from the old aqua raiders sets. The playability is basic, a lego's small set playability. Overall, this set is small due to includes a CD rom with a chess game, and the both are good. I rate this 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set is very easy to build and the throne is very sturdy and we got a silver crystal on the top. This throne is a nice addition to set 6098 if you want to change the throne. This set doesn't have any play features but the main reason why you should get this model is because of the minifig:<br><br>The minifig is very hard to find and it's the only set where you can get this figure. The king has a golden crown, a white staff with a transparent red and a transparent green stud. He also got white pants, red arms, a red cape and a very cool armor printing on his torso. The king also got a black mustache.<br><br></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can youse for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Minifig<br>Nice starter set<br>No stickers<br>Nice addition to your LEGO Castle collection<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>No play features<br><br><br>All
in all it's a great set to get and I would highly recommend you to get
this model. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
