Compared to the suited minifig from set #6862 this looked really good. Fortunately, they were eventually made available in the UK with pre-orders, and I managed to bag one for myself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This is a polybag set. It has a nice illustration on the front, and comes with a small set of clear instructions for the (very short) build.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set has a really nice armour piece. We've seen a similar armour piece on #8831-8, Galaxy Patrol. The mix of green (my favourite colour) and purple really makes the figure stand out. There are some trans-green pieces in here too, which give the HUGE gun it's kryptonite powered look.</p><p>Randomly, there are 3 black 2x2 blocks which don't really serve any purpose or add to the set, but they will come in handy elsewhere.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigure is the main part of this set, and it's a good one. It is a lot better than the Lex Luthor from #6862, and stands out a lot better in a display of minifigures. Without the armour on, you can see the body printing on the front and back, which is quite detailed considering it is covered up.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not hugely entertaining, and very quick. This set is for play/display more than the building experience. The build consists of 3 2x2&nbsp;black&nbsp;blocks, the minifig assembly, a&nbsp;jet-pack&nbsp;on the back of the armour&nbsp;piece, and the HUGE kryptonite blaster.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks great in my&nbsp;line-up&nbsp;of DC minifigs. The gun is very heavy, so the completed model doesn't stand up on it's own with the blaster attached. For display puposes, this can be overcome by adding one of the CMF bases or a 2x4 plate. When he has the armor on, blaster has to be placed in his hand at an angle, or he can't stand up. I just don't get why they included the 2x2 blocks, they are just a bit pointless.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Ultimately, this is more of a collector's display piece than anything else. Children will get some play value out of it when combined with another DC set. That armour looks great. The blaster is a bit cumbersome, but looks really good, and completes the ""beefy"" look of Lex in his power armour. This is a must for DC minifig collectors. It's great value for money if you planned on buying the Lego Batman 2 game anyway. If you're not bothered about the game, you'll have to settle for aftermarket prices, or you can get the PC version (cheapest) and sell the game on later.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

Small complaint, thought.&nbsp; This is a classic comic character made into a Lego mini - I couldn't be happier with it.",FALSE,4,4,4,5,5
