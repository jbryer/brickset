"CapnRex101","2012-04-09T11:57:36.013Z","8831 (8) - Galaxy Patrol","<p>We have seen numerous outstanding Minifigures since the beginning of this fantastic theme, however this one has to be up there with the best for me. Since the first images were released of Series 7, I have been eagerly anticipating this figure over all of the others. I am more than&nbsp;satisfied! Nothing about this&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;lets it down and the parts are all totally fantastic. Let us get on and see what all of the fuss is about...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>If we start at the top as usual with the helmet we see that it is in fact a brand new mould! I thought it was going to be the same as we have seen worn by the Spaceman from Series 1 and one or two others since then, but it most certainly is not! It shares a similar look but has different details including what look look screws on either side of the piece and some segmented armour plating on the top and front as well. The only issue I have with this component is that I cannot find a way to attach a visor, so it appears you have to make do with an open helmet, nevertheless, it is a great piece, especially in this nice dark blue.</p><p>The head is a very unique design. It has two faces, one on each side of the piece which is great to see. One side shows the face with a red holographic scree in front of it with all kinds of tactical information and a targeting reticule in a heads up display. You can see his eyes and a serious grimace behind the screen. The other side has no heads up display but just a smirk, some stubble, and an interesting bionic section covering his left eye.</p><p>The large torso armour piece is fantastic with plenty of detail including nozzles, pipes and that nice big neck guard giving the squat look to the Minifigure. This is already being used in another set as it is worn by Lex&nbsp;Luthor&nbsp;in a polybag model. However the colours and printing on this one is exclusive as it is the same dark blue as most of the rest of the figure and, in a nod to the classic space series, each shoulder is printed with the space logo. A wonderful little inclusion which really brings the piece to life. There are studs on the front and back of the chest piece so it is possible to customise him a bit. The back of this component has two pipes which I think are the jets for his jet pack, whatever they are, they look great!</p><p>The actual torso piece is mostly covered up when he wears his heavy shoulder armour, but still it has lots of detail including lots of screws, metal plating, and some indecipherable text. Best of all though, and the only bit visible when he wears the chunky armour) is the segmented plates which allow him some ease of movement. His arms are also dark blue with grey gloves and there is no back printing.</p><p>The hips are dark grey and printed with a belt. The legs are also highly detailed showing knee pads, chains, and some metallic lines crossing the legs in every direction.</p><p>He carries just one accessory, an Alien Conquest gun in black for the first time. It looks good in black and I prefer it to the older dark grey piece.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>All in all, this is probably my equal favourite from this series for numerous reasons. Firstly, the look of the figure with his huge bulky armour and lovely helmet. Also the playability is simply superb! Who doesn't like a space commando? If you are a fan of the classic space sets then the logos on here will appeal to you in particular and they break up the otherwise monochrome Minifigure so they are nice to see for that reason as well. I can find no real flaws with this figure apart from the lack of&nbsp;anywhere&nbsp;to attach a visor, but that is an extremely minor complaint and not worth knocking a point off for.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 10/10</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

He also comes with a helmet like piece which goes on top of his head and with the printed legs with the silver printed lines and pattern makes the figure look very strong and powerful. There is also silver printing on the chest of the figure which is a good job too which also most of cannot be seen when the chest plat piece is worn.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also helping up with this impressive figure is the fact he features changing faces one with the usual figure skin tone with a slightly smiling face while the other side which has an orange colour on there with a serious looking face [which for some reason reminds me of the sontarans from dr who].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall in my opinion perhaps the best figure of series [or one of the best] as he features highly detailed armour, printing and changeable faces and one I would very strongly recommend buying whether you intend to buy all of series 7 or not.

"Shistavanen_brick","2012-04-29T15:43:55.25Z","Don't even THINK about it, space scum. We're the Galaxy Patrol!","Series 7 came out a bit too fast after series 6 in my opinion, but now they are here. Among them, this figure is one of the coolest by far (especially if you are into space themes and MOCs).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I forgive the recycled pieces from the Alien Conquest theme, just because the new colours are way better than before. I hope you can agree that most space weapons look more tough in black rather than grey. This figure can fit into many themes, or at least I believe so. Perhaps as some elite sentry guard in the Star Wars line, or City... young LEGO fans can surely come up with endless ways to use it.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigure.</h4><div><br></div><div>The Galaxy Patrol soldier looks a lot like the ADU counterparts from the theme mentioned above, the helmet and weapon are just in black and dark blue. However, added is a bulky armour &amp; jetpack combined, a double-sided head and some interesting printing on both torso and legs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Weapon/armour:</b> The black spacegun fits perfectly in the patrol's hands. You can make him hold it either in the handle or underneath the barrel - in case you need an army of them in troop movement mode and not wanting them to blast the armour of the guy in front. You get the picture. The helmet is also a great piece to the armour look. Too bad it's not as easy to hold in any of the hands. Armour is big and covers most of the upper torso. What I like is that it protects the head fairly well thanks to the big shoulder plates. It also gives him some playability with the armour being combined with a jetpack! Thumbs up for the retro design of the LEGO space logo from the 80's.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Head:</b> This figure is one among few who has a doublesided head. I think it works great, an orange visor illusion on one side, and some targeting effect on the other side. It feels like one side is for space action and the other while on planets with oxygen.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Torso/legs:</b> They both are printed in some silvery style and the detail is just fine. Not too much of it is visible when the armour is on. If one should be picky about anything it might be the lack of backprinting. I'm not annoyed by that but I can fully understand those who are.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div><br></div><div>I think you would need at least 2 of these. They can serve in so many ways in so many themes, which is a very neat ability in itself.

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T01:42:11.17Z","Patrol the Galaxy to Defend the Universe","<p><strong>Set #8831 Galaxy Patrol:</strong> Series 7 is slowly being completed and when I found this particular character I was very pleased. Another great Classic Space inspired character that definitely deserves to be army built.</p>

<p>Galaxy Patrol is a nice dark blue in colour with awesome silver detailing in the torso print, which is single sided and features sophisticated body armour. He also has leg printing and apparently his name is included I believe it&#39;s Luiz or Wiz, difficult to tell exactly.</p>

<p>Using the thick new armour piece with the Classic Space logo printed on the shoulders and a nifty looking helmet piece Galaxy Patrol includes the new space gun accessory and features a dual-sided face. Both prints are fairly similar, the facial expressions are different and one side has an orange HUD display mask printed over it.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m very impressed by this minifigure. CMF Classic Space inspired characters are always welcome and building a small army of them is always fun. This figure is a bit harder to come by now, however I strongly recommend hunting this down. He&#39;s great looking and has some decent design cues that were carried forward with later Classic Space inspired characters wearing similar armour pieces.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-02T01:38:07.853Z","the first of many to come!!!","<p>The eighth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Galaxy Patrol. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that helmet piece, which I believe was new for the figure. I love the moulding all over it, with the sci-fi&nbsp;design. I love how round it is, even with all the rigged detail, and I think there&#39;s a handle on the bottom to allow a minifigure to grab it. Also, the colouring of it is fantastic, being that very dark blue-green colour. Overall, it&#39;s a great piece.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which is excellent. I love the sci-fi print, with the brown screen being displayed on it. I like all the details on it, as well as the beard and angry expression beneath it. That front face is fantastic, but the brown-screen printing doesn&#39;t exactly cover the width of the opening in front of the helmet. I wish it would&#39;ve covered the whole thing, but oh well. This face actually has an alternate expression, which is a normal yellow design, with a stubble, a small smirk, and a metal eye-patch. That face looks great, but it is a bit inaccurate to the main face. See, the brown-screen face has a normal eye, but the alternate expression has an eyepatch. I mean I&#39;m not complaining, but that seems to be an error on LEGO&#39;s part. Nonetheless, I do like both of his faces. So let&#39;s move on.</p>

<p>Next is that breastplate piece, which if&nbsp;I had to guess, I would say it was new for the figure. I love the deep blue-colour once again, and I like how it has the classic space logo on the shoulders. Speaking of which, I love how the shoulders are smooth and round, and I also like the stud in the middle and how it doesn&#39;t cover the whole torso. I love how it surrounds the neck, and the back of it has some more great detail, with a jet-pack design as well as a stud in the centre. Overall, it is a good piece. I do wish it had some more printing on it, especially&nbsp;the front; but still, it is a good piece.</p>

<p>And next is his torso, which has some fantastic printing. LEGO didn&#39;t need to print it, but they did, and the printing is absolutely amazing. I just love the silver technical-looking printing on the stomach and around the neck, and it doesn&#39;t look like he has back printing. Still, the front printing is very impressive, and overall, it&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Next are the legs, which have some more amazing printing. I love how it has the belt detail, as well as all the robotic straps on the front of the legs. Another thing I love is how the top section is that dark grey colour and the two bottom parts are that dark blue-green colour.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have that gun, which is a nice inclusion. Again, an accessory was unnecessary, so it&#39;s great to see one here. I like how it&#39;s caste in black, too.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for the figure! I didn&#39;t used to like this figure all that much, but looking back on it, it&#39;s actually pretty great. I like all the insanely good printing on him, and the sci-fi look he has really works. However, he isn&#39;t one of my favourites of the series, maybe because this is the first of so many space mechs to come, and I&#39;m burnt out, as I said in the title.&nbsp;Still, I&#39;m gonna give him a 4. And that&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
