<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- Nicely printed face with John Lennon style glasses and fitting moustache. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Psychodelic printed t-shirt, covered by some sort of tassled jacket, and printed pattern also on the arms.<br></li><li>- Authentic hippie hair with headband.<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cons</li></ul>

<ul><li>- No printing on back but doesn't really matter because it's covered up mostly by the hair.<br></li><li>- The flowers to me are a bit lame. Okay it's a new flower stalk piece, but an acoustic guitar would have been a lot better.<br></li><li>- Wot no Jesus sandals!<br></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all a great minifig, and will fit nicely into MOCs - maybe with the growing band members or as an anti-war demonstrator in the city. The possabilities, as ever, are endless. Overall, I've just got to say Groooovy Mannnn.....<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-05-18T10:40:52.777Z","""Uhm... should we grab som gut wadding (fast food) while we wait for the sunset?""","This figure actually surprised me a lot. I picked up a random bag along with some stuff for my daughter the other day, and when I got back home and put it together it really looked fantastic. It is ALL about colour with this one, no dull conformity but just an outburst in colours no normal minifigure would wear. But the hippie doesn't care. He's just glad to be able to spread some colour and flowers around him it seems.<div><br></div><h4>The minifigure.</h4><div><br></div><div><b>Legs:</b> Purple legs. Nothing special, although it was the right colour.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Torso:</b> I've got to say it almost brightens and outshines most LEGO torsos. It has some really nice printing on the arms an front, revealing what looks like some fringe vest and underneath a tie-dye yarn knitwear. Or it could be something else. Either way, I like the center pattern, similar to a vortex of some kind.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Head:</b> He has a serene expression and the retro glasses suits the mustache prefectly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Hair:</b> Here is the main attraction! Long hair with a bandana... I mean, how much perfect can it get?</div><div><br></div><div>He also comes with a flower, the new kind of stem pieces that ables him to hold it more natural than previous versions. The actual flowers are yellow and you get four of them, even the flower piece only has room for three. Nice to keep an extra, maybe? I will say that this is one of my favorites.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>An excellent figure which is spot on.</li><li>New pieces.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>It is so far hard to find any REAL cons for this series.</li><li>Perhaps either a guitar or a hippie placard (Dudes! Brick rules) should have been included?</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3

The hair piece looks very nice and we also get a very colorful torso for this figure. I also like the purple pants which this hippie has. This character comes with some nice details on his face and some flowers as well.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-10T12:23:35.41Z","Far out man, peace.","<p>Set #8831 Hippie: What's not to love about this Mini-Fig?</p>
<p>The Hippie is a great Mini-Fig from series 7, he's carrying appropriately enough a stem full of yellow flowers, true to life as it were. He's got an interesting and unique torso print with lime green for the arms and a light tan for the torso itself. The printed detailing is single sided, showing a vest over a green sweater with psychedelic blue and dark pink swirl pattern on the chest. His arms feature some printing for the added level of authenticity of detailing for the outfit.</p>
<p>His purple pants look to be the same dark purple color The Joker wears, with no printing sadly, his head is one-sided with a neat looking brown haired moustache and some wire-rime glasses. And then we come to the hair piece. This is singularly one of the best looking hairpieces I've ever seen from LEGO, even if the length of it hinders neck movement on the Mini-Fig it's just great looking. The orange hair band molded on and painted that color just adds to the sheer fun factor this hair piece offers. It looks great.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this Hippie, while a bit on the unusual side for Mini-Fig choices, is a must own. The pieces are perfect for any number of mix-and-match Mini-Figs. In fact, with the right color hair piece from your LEGO Friends assortment you can turn this Hippie into LEGO Wierd-Al Yankovick. Yep, you can't go wrong with this dude.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-05T06:59:50.607Z","8831 (11) - Hippie","<p>The Hippie is one of the Minifigures I was most looking forward to in this series. The figure lives up to my expectations completely. It has two brand new moulded pieces and plenty of detailed printing all over him which makes him one of the best figures of the series for display in my opinion. I was not present in the 1960s when Hippies were around in vast numbers, but to adult fans of Lego who were, this little guy could be a great collectors piece, and a reminder of a ""shrill and pointless decade"", to quote the Simpsons.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start with the hairpiece of this figure, which is one of the two new moulds. It is perfectly suited to this character and looks very much like the actual hairstyles of the time. The piece has a hair band moulded into it as well as some textured detailing on the hair. The hair is split into two sections at the front which flow down to just over half way down the torso. At the back it goes down to a similar level which obscures most of the back of the figure. His hair is light brown and the band around his head is orange, which is a great colour scheme.</p><p>His head is nice, printed with brown eyebrows and a large moustache which looks great. He also has glasses and a slightly spaced out expression which I think is a very nice touch. There is no double sided head which is a shame as I would have liked to see another face with his eyes closed, but you cannot have it all!</p><p>His torso has highly detailed printing on it. He is wearing a bright green T-shirt with a blue and pink spiral pattern on it. Over his shirt he is wearing a tan coloured sleeveless jacket which looks great with two pockets and a sort of poncho design at the top of his torso, which is mostly covered by his hair. He has no back printing but he does have printing on his green arms. On each arm there are two yellow stripes which have rough edges, given them an almost drawn on look which is very unique. He has bare hands so they are yellow like his face.</p><p>His legs and hips are plain purple which compliments the torso nicely and is a suitable colour for the character.</p><p>Finally, we get a new flower stalk piece, which is quite similar to the older one which has been around for years, but this time can be held more easily by figures unlike the older ones by having a clip at the bottom, instead of a hole to fit onto studs. It has also been seen in this series of the Collectable Minifigures with the Bride. There are four yellow flower heads which are included on a sprue, but only three are required to fit on the flower stalk piece so we get an extra one.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a figure which is just about perfect and I love it. I would certainly recommend it to anyone and would say that it is a must have. I think there is some&nbsp;playability, but this Minifigure is much more of a piece for display in my opinion. With no real drawbacks to this figure I am obliged to award it full marks.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-03T02:28:23.57Z","one of my FAVOURITES!","<p>The eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Hippie. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 9 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that hair piece, which was new for the figure. I just love that piece so much, with how it hangs down on the torso, and how it hangs behind him. I also love how smooth it is, as well as the reddish-brown colour it&#39;s caste in. That orange band on top is printed, and it adds a lot to the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has a fantastic face print. I love the orange glasses, as well as the reddish-brown moustache. I like how peaceful his eyes are, as well as his little smile. He has no alternate expression, but that frontal face is fantastic, so it&#39;s alright.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has more amazing printing, so I&#39;m gonna break it all down. First off, I love the blue and pink swirl dead centre o the torso, and that light brown jacket on the sides is a very nice touch. Something else I just love so much, is that he has arm printing, which was unnecessary, and that makes it a lot cooler. I love the orange bits on both arms, and I like how they look on the light spring green arms. And something that&#39;s amazing to me is that the green shirt on front is actually printed, and the torso is caste in light brown, making the jacket design&nbsp;cover the back as well. He has no back printing, but I like how the jacket design from the torso continues onto the back due to the light brown colour it&#39;s caste in. This is just such a great torso and arm-combo.</p>

<p>And next is the legs, which have no printing. I just love how they are caste in purple, though, and it adds a lot to the figure. Nonetheless, the flowers make for a very fitting accessory. I love the choice of using yellow as the colour&nbsp;for the flowers on the green stem piece as well.</p>

<p>But that is all for this figure, and overall, this is one of my favourites in the series. I just love the concept of having a hippie, though I feel like it might offend some folks. I like the hair, the face, the torso, and even his purple legs. They just all come together for a nice figure! And that&#39;s all for thus review! Thanks for reading!</p>
