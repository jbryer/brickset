I adore these figures and this figure is just as good as the others we have seen previously. He has one brand new mould and a very useful carrot which has previously been fairly difficult to come by, making this figure highly desirable.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The first piece I will look at is the bunny head piece. It is a new mould and looks superb. It perfectly fits around the head and the face is positioned perfectly to peer out which is excellent. The huge ears are printed in light pink an the rest of the piece is cast in white. The piece may not have many uses other than on this Minifigure, but it looks great here so it does its job well!</p><p>The head is printed with a big grin and eyebrows which really express the cheerful nature of the character very effectively indeed. It is quite similar to the face from the Spaceman from Series 1 of the Collectable Minifigures but it is great to see a brand new head print.</p><p>The torso is mostly white, but is printed with a large pink area in the middle of his chest with rough edging to show a furry edge to the pink area which is realistic. The back is also printed very simply with a bunny tail which is an absolutely lovely touch on this figure and really demonstrates the care that Lego take over designing their figures.</p><p>The legs are totally white which is perfectly satisfactory, no printing or detail is required so I am quite pleased with this piece and it is very suitable for this Minifigure.</p><p>The figure holds one accessory and that is a carrot, exactly what you would expect a rabbit to have with it! Carrots have been seen a fair amount before, but never in such an inexpensive package as this one. The carrot is made from two parts, the main orange part of the vegetable which is cast with some small details of various lumps and bumps on the surface of the carrot, and the green stalk piece which is nice as well. It makes the carrot look really nice and can be reused in various other ways such as for shrubs and other plants. It also allows the figure to hold the carrot without it looking awkward and unbalanced which is very important if you want to display the Minifigure.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a figure which is really worth adding to your collection. It is not my favourite Minifigure of this series, but is a lovely figure nevertheless. I very much like the rabbit hat and this is a great way to obtain the extremely useful carrot as I mentioned above. The playability is very good, especially if you have the other two costumed Minifigures for him to interact with. The only&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;I have of the figure is the slight lack of detail. The simple white and pink printing is fine, but I would have liked to see a little more printing to show the texture of the material of the suit. Despite this one small complaint, the Minifigure still earns...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 9/10</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"AETerry","2012-10-24T21:25:45.39Z","Bunny Suit Guy Review","<p>Where to start? This guy is adorable and cute. I can see it being used for any number of Halloween and Easter MOCs. This figure marks the third costumed character. The other two of course being the Gorilla Suit and Lizard Suit minifigures.<br><br>So in that respect, as a costumed character, it's not that original. But he does provide more variety for those looking for this type of figure. He comes with a carrot that's rather uncommon. It is a piece showing up in more sets, notably Friends for those looking to create a LEGO garden or Market place. The print design is elegant and does the job well of conveying the cotton tail on back and pink belly on front of the torso. And a unique piece for this set is the head piece with the ears, making it more easily found in a case of minifigures for those searching this figure out.<br><br>As long as LEGO can continue on this track of creating unique characters and concepts for their Collectible Line, keeping up not just the concepts, the print designs and unique pieces, the price tag of $2.99 for a figure isn't going to feel that bad.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-24T17:02:21.03Z","a GREAT, SIMPLE FIGURE!","<p>The third figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Bunny Suit Guy. He was released in 2012, retailed for 3 dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that bunny mask, and wow, I love that piece so much. The moulding with how the ears jut out looks great, as does the pink insides of it. It was new to the figure, and I think the choice of making the figure white and pink is a great one.</p>

<p>Next is the face, and I really love the expression. I love the smile, as well as the thin eyebrows. He has no alternate face, but the frontal face is pretty great, so it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and the pink fur on it looks fantastic. I love the fuzzy edges, and it has a little tuft of fur on the back of his torso as well, which is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>And his legs have no printing, as they are just plain white, which is okay, as they don&#39;t really need printing. His accessory, however, is that carrot and stem. Now I apologise, but I really don&#39;t know if either of those pieces were new or not. If they were new, they both look amazing and are great accessories, and if they aren&#39;t new, they both look amazing and are great accessories. A carrot for an accessory works really well, and it just fits so well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure! This review was pretty short, but that&#39;s okay because this is a simple figure. Is that a bad thing? Not even a little! The overall design doesn&#39;t need to be crazily complex, and having something simple like this is amazing. I think a bunny suit CMF is a great concept, and it&#39;s executed extremely well. 5 out of 5 for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Check out my profile, and thanks for reading!</p>
