However, it is certainly still worth picking up especially if you have the Punk Rocker from Series 4 which goes very nicely with this figure.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair is a brand new moulded piece and it looks great on this figure. It suits the unkempt appearance of the rest of the figure and being pink it goes nicely with the Punk Rocker and his pink hair. Unfortunately I cannot see many alternative uses for this hairpiece making it a little less desirable in my opinion. Despite this though the part looks great on this Minifigure and it fills the purpose nicely.</p><p>The face is printed with eyelashes and an open mouth as well as a bit of mascara and even a pink lightning bolt which again somewhat limits its uses to this figure alone.</p><p>Another pink lightning bolt crosses the light blue torso which is an interesting design. It also features a black sash and some black striping. Across the bottom of the torso a black belt is printed with silver studs and a nice buckle. On the black half of the top the arm is black, on the blue half the arm is blue, here hands are plain yellow.</p><p>The legs are also printed with a similar half black, half blue design and more stripes. The skirt goes part of the way down before giving way to yellow and then white for boots.</p><p>She carries a guitar which is similar to that of the Punk Rocker being the same shape exactly but in a different colour and with varying printing. This one is white with another pink lightning bolt and plenty of buttons and dials as well as the electric guitar strings of course.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Basically, this is a figure which is very nice but is far from the best of the entire series. It is certainly worth having but go for some of the others first if you can only get a few Minifigures. Nevertheless, I love the guitar and the hair, and if you have the Punk Rocker from Series 4 then this goes very nicely with that and you can get plenty of playability from those two figures. If you do not have the Punk Rocker then this is still a decent figure though. My score is distinctly average reflecting the fairly standard figure.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-04-25T09:07:24.177Z","80's groovy music!","I picked up this minifigure just yesterday, it was a random pick for me and I had no idea what I would end up with. Surprise, surprise...it was the punk rocker girl! Truthfully, it wasn't all that bad. I had hoped for either the evil knight or galactic patrol but time didn't allow for some serious exploring of the new (2012) minifigure line. I like the red polybags, very suiting.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigure.</h4><div>This girl looks like she's been time-warped from the colourful 80's. The hair and her clothes kind of gives her away. Am I the only one who see similarities between this girl to the 80's cartoon show Jem &amp; The Holograms??? This figure has lots of bright colours and details to it, I think the hair is just <b><i>crazy</i></b>&nbsp;pink, but it works. It makes you wonder whether possible future band mates will also carry pink as their band colour in some way. Series 4 <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8804-4"">Punk Rocker</a> had the pink mohawk, so...</div><div><br></div><div>The guitar included is a nice piece to have and a good complement to the Punk Rocker's black one. I would like to see more music minifigures coming out in the future, just imagine the possibilities for cool instruments. As a whole, this minifigure can be highly underestimated for a couple of reasons. Like, if you want another one instead you might be willing to make sure you<i> won't</i> end up with Punk Rocker Girl. You should try to get it if you can. If you like diverse colours and pink, you can't afford to pass this up.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Solid pink hairpiece.</li><li>Great looking guitar.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>No real cons, to be honest.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,4

The figure also comes a very cool pink hair piece which as far as Iam aware has not been done yet and is a new piece making a very nice touch to the figure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The mini fig also has a printed punky rocky looking clothes printed on her chest and legs as well fitting in strongly with the character overall.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This figure goes very well with all the other series 7 mini figures and also the series four punk guitarist which as well as a singer you pretty much have a lego rock band.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This figure isn't the best but certainly not the worst in the series but one I would recommend buying or finding if you are interested in the series seven range or wanting to start a lego rock band.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,3

<p>Sadly her torso print is single-sided, however it includes a very 1980&#39;s big hair band style outfit design, which is carried onto her leg print, this was before the advent of dual molded legs so her legs feature printing for the skin visible under the skirt. Her hair piece is a large pink sculpt that looks great, and very evocative of 80&#39;s hair bands. Her white guitar accessory includes some nice lightning-bolt shaped logo and decent printing for the strings and other elements.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say there&#39;s a lot of use out of her parts if you&#39;re a fan of the 80&#39;s hair bands, even more so if you wanted to MOC a Jem and the Holograms inspired figure. Overall I&#39;d recommend tracking a few down.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-04T23:02:43.09Z","an excellent gender swap!","<p>The fifteenth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Rocker Chick. She was released in 2012, retailed for three bucks, and includes 6 pieces. Keep in mind, this is a gender swap of the Series 4 Punk Rocker. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that large, pink hair, which I believe was new for the figure. Man, I love that piece, with how huge and round and ridiculous it is. I also love how it&#39;s caste in pink. The moulding on it is pretty good with all the ruffles, and it fits the figure extremely well. One thing to note is that&#39;s the same colour as the original Punk Rocker figure, which again, this was a gender swap of.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has that really great singing expression. I love the hot pink lipstick, as well as the hot pink eye-shadow. And that small, pink lightning bolt on the side of her face is a great little touch. She has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and her torso and arms both are fantastic. I love how it has the blue with black stripes on one side, and I like how the other side is separated by that giant pink lightning bolt. The black on the left side (being her left side,) looks great next to the blue, and her big belt on the bottom is nice as well. Of course, one of my favourite details about her is how one arms is black, and the other is blue, which accurately match up with the torso. She has no back printing, and the torso is caste in blue, which doesn&#39;t match the black on the front of her shirt. But oh well!</p>

<p>Next is her legs, and the printed detail on them is extremely amazing. Starting on top, I like the black line on that upper section of the legs, and the printing on the two bottom pieces is fantastic. I love how that black matches up perfectly on all parts of the legs, and the black tiger stripes looks great. I love how one leg&nbsp;has black on the side, and the other leg has blue. I also love how much yellow flesh is printed on both legs. All in all, the printing on the front and sides of the legs is phenomenal.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her guitar. The piece itself wasn&#39;t new, but I think the colouring of it might be. I love the black tuners, the black strings, and also the three black buttons on the bottom of one. The other side has that big, pink lightning bolt, and it looks great on the white base. Speaking of which, I love seeing that piece in white. It&#39;s interesting how she has the same accessory as the original Punk Rocker, which once again, this was a gender swap of him. It&#39;s a fitting accessory, and it looks awesome.</p>

<p>And that is all for this figure! I love this figure a whole lot, and she&#39;s one of my favourites in the series. I love how colourful she is, with the blue, pink, white, and black, and her new hair is a nice inclusion. I&#39;m also really impressed with all her printing, though she does lack back printing. Also, she&#39;s one of my favourite gender swaps out there. So overall, I&#39;m gonna give her a solid 5 out of 5. That wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
