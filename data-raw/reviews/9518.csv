"CapnRex101","2012-06-11T16:29:21.24Z","8831 (16) - Grandma Visitor","<p>The Grandma Visitor (or Little Red Riding Hood) is an excellent choice for a Collectable Minifigure in my opinion, and my expectations for this figure were very high following the release of images of this series. I am not at all disappointed, the Minifigure has lots of detail, comes with a brand new piece, and is just a lovely character to have in Lego form. As well as the brand new woven basket, the parts which we have seen before included with the figure are all very desirable as well, especially the hood and short red cape which are both superb. This Minifigure is in fact a very close likeness to the original character!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The red hood piece is fairly important given the character being recreated, and this is the first time we have got this component in red which could be useful for your own Minifigures, or even your MOCs if you use it creatively! It fits around her head as do other hood pieces and lines up perfectly with her face printing as one would expect.</p><p>The face print is excellent. She has a slight smile, a few freckles on her cheeks and brown eyebrows. It is very appropriate for the character and certainly makes her look like a child, which is what she is supposed to be after all. I would have quite liked to see a reversible head with an alternative face print on the back of perhaps her screaming at seeing the hungry wolf.</p><p>The short red cape is a nice piece which has never before been seen in this colour like the hood, these short capes are fairly rare so it is nice for one to be available so inexpensively. It fits seamlessly with the hood and they do some to flow which is good and looks quite realistic which is great.</p><p>The torso features an elaborately decorated blouse which is mostly white and features some creasing details as well as some cross patterning at the bottom of the torso. She has a white belt and a large red bow around her neck. She seems to be wearing a black sleeveless jacket over this white blouse, which I would have preferred to be red as it would be more in keeping with the rest of the Minifigure. The whole design is printed on a black torso piece and there is no back printing which is fine as it is totally obscured by the cape anyway. Her arms are white and she has yellow hands.</p><p>Her short legs are plain red with no printing. I am very pleased they chose to use short legs here as it makes the&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of the character much closer to her fairy tale counterpart which can only be a good thing.</p><p>The one new mould that is included with this Minifigure is the excellent basket piece. It is cast in a dark tan rubbery plastic and has two handles which can be held by Minifigures. It has some texture on the sides of the basket and there are two holes to fit onto a studded surface on the bottom of the piece. The open area in the middle is fairly small, big enough to store a few Lego cherries or one apple at a stretch. It looks fairly realistic and I think it is an excellent little part which could be very sought after.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a Minifigure which I would recommend to anybody, it has a lot of detail and there are some play possibilities here as well, especially if you have the Werewolf from the Monster Theme which would make a great wolf to pursue Little Red Riding Hood through the forest and could interact very nicely with this Minifigure! I am going to knock a point off for the bizarre colour choice used on the torso and the lack of a double sided head. Nevertheless, this a great Minifigure and one which you should&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;pick up if you can as not only does it look great, but it is a superb Minifigure to play with as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 9/10</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"MetroiD","2012-09-27T06:43:44.597Z","A-Tisket, a-tasket, she's got a dark flesh basket!","<p>I've always thought that ""dark flesh"" was one of the weirdest colour designations, but there you have it - it's dark flesh, and it's also made from rubber. What's more important, this tiskety taskety basket is a great accessory that can really help set your minifig shoppers apart from each other. It can also be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;useful as a detail in street scenes or even facades, of course provided that you're a fan of ""NPU"" and are not opposed to seeing accessories anywhere other than in your minifigs' hands.</p><div><br></div><div>In short, to me personally the basket accessory is what sets this minifig apart. Granted, it is not limited exclusively to the Visitor and is also available in Friends sets - but the only way you can get it in this weird-sounding yet great-looking colour is by buying the Grandma Visitor. Which automatically increases the value for money ratio of this set.</div><div><br></div><div>Aside from the basket, the Little Red Riding Hood is not&nbsp;<i>too</i>&nbsp;special. Oh yes - apart from the fact that she's not actually the Little Red Riding Hood due to reasons having little to do with the intent of the Brothers Grimm and everything to do with protection of intellectual property. As we all know, TLG are loath to paying obscene amounts for the use of particular names and words, hence we get Team GB for the Olympics and well... the ""visitor"" for the little red riding hood.</div><div><br></div><div>Having set that straight, I'll also add my name to the list of people who are unimpressed by the principal designation of the minifigure, since ""Grandma Visitor"" does sound a bit too outlandish to me. Luckily though, the minifig itself is as traditional as they come - down to the red hood and cape. The freckled face of this little red visitor is also something many of us would find appropriate to stock up on - proper ""kid"" facial expressions in LEGO minifigures are not seen too often, so having new ones around is always nice.</div><div><br></div><div>In short: The Grandma Visitor is probably among the best minifigs in Series 7 for those who appreciate special elements. Her basket, hood and facial expression might not be as innovative as the hippie's hairpiece, but they're still very well worth owning.</div><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-17T19:02:33.833Z","To Grandmother's House we go.","<p><strong>Set #8831 Grandma Visitor:</strong> This makes for a nice little minifigure from Series 7, it can be a Little Red Riding Hood, or someone out for Halloween Candy, it doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;d prefer for your display, she&#39;s quite a good looking figure.</p>

<p>Her torso has a single-sided print with a cute looking black dress with a white front with little x shapes on the bottom and a red ribbon tied into a bow to show that her short cape and hood are secured. Her large basket accessory is a bit too large, and unfortunately she isn&#39;t holding any treats, however it is a nice realistic light tan colour compared to the colours used in most LEGO Friends sets where the part originated.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d have to say she&#39;s ok for what she is, not the strongest offering from the Series, but a very nice looking figure and definitely recommended if you&#39;re a completionist or enjoy fantasy inspired characters in your collection. So again, recommended.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-08-01T08:50:02.153Z","""Grandma, what a large LEGO collection you have!"" ","<p>This is part 2 of ""UtarEmpire's adventures in buying Collectible Minifigs at random"", the first part having been recorded in <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/?ID=43390"">my review of Intergalactic Girl</a>. Of course, it is likely that this fact has no relevance to you, but I'm stating it anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now Grandma Visitor is a strange Minifig for sure, since she doesn't quite fit in with any of the overarching majors themes that LEGO currently has out there. There's a very loose ""fantasy"" subtheme that sort of floats through the Collectible Minifigs as a whole, but considering that they range the gamut from ancient Greek mythology to modern horror incarnations, that's not really much of a ""theme"". So Grandma Visitor sort of stands sadly alone. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, she's kind of cute. She has a charming freckled face and short legs, so she's adorable. She <em>wants </em>to fit in, and you'd be a monster to not allow her to give it a shot. Does your kid in City House (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8403-1"">8403</a>) need a friend? &nbsp;Or perhaps she'll set off from Kingdoms Joust (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10223-1"">10223</a>) into the forbidding woods just beyond its borders? You'll find a way to get it work out, I'm sure, unless you're one of those cats who collects only Star Wars sets and nothing else. Talk about mainstream!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the coolest thing about Grandma Visitor is the little wicker bag that she has on her. It's made out of that newer rubbery kind of material, which is actually appropriate for a bag. I find that it's useful for storing tiny odds and ends that have a tendency to get lost, such as the One Ring from the Lord of the Rings line. Speaking of which, Grandma Visitor makes a great companion for Hobbits since she's of comparable size. The very literal Fellowship could stand to have some female perspective, and I think she can handle the journey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so, the ultimate question: worth getting? Not worth getting? It's hard for me to make a recommendation one way or another. On the off-chance that you are actually attempting to recreate Little Red Riding Hood out of LEGO, chances are slim that you'll&nbsp;need this specific character. On the other hand, she has a sort of charm that kind of grows&nbsp;on you in time. If you feel like picking up a slightly different flavour for your collection, you can't go wrong with Grandma Visitor. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,3
"sideswinger","2021-05-05T00:57:53.343Z","OKAY, but a bit boring!","<p>The sixteenth and final figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Grandma Visitor. She was released in 2012, retailed for three bucks, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that red hood piece. Getting the hood in that colour is really rare, so it&#39;s great seeing it here for the &quot;grandma visitor,&quot; who has no relation to Little Red Riding Hood...yeah, there was some sarcasm there. Anyway, the hood looks great being in red, and it obviously fits the figure.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which looks superb to me. I love the freckles on both sides of her face, and the small smile looks cute as well. One thing I will say about it, is that it isn&#39;t the most unique face nowadays. I suppose it was interesting as heck back then, but again, it isn&#39;t super special in today&#39;s time. She has no alternate expression either.</p>

<p>Moving on, we have her torso, which features a really fantastic design. I love the white apron on front, as well as the red stitches on the bottom. She even has that little red knot on top for the hood, which is an adorable touch. Her arms are plain white, which is a very nice touch. Of course, due to a light colour being printed on a dark one, the white apron looks a bit faded, but that&#39;s a common problem in LEGO figures. This figure has no back printing, which is understandable since that cape completely conceals it.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m currently realising that I forgot to discuss the cape...whoops! Anyway, the cape is a great inclusion, replicating her red hood, which is a crucial part of the figure, and it&#39;s great that it&#39;s included here. I like how small it is, and how it matches the hood piece so well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which are those small legs. I love seeing them in red, and I love how they match the rest of the figure so well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessory, which is that bag. That bag piece was new for the figure, and seeing it in that dark nougat colour is great and also a bit rare even in today&#39;s time. I love that piece, and I also love how LEGO took the time to give the figure a brand-new piece, especially when that new piece was not even that necessary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, this figure is just okay. I love how she has a new bag piece, and she does look like a typical little red riding hood. But she just doesn&#39;t look super special, and the printing on her is just okay. So overall, I&#39;m gonna give her a very high 2 out of 5, and it&#39;s almost a 3 out of 5. Anyway, that is all for this figure! Thanks for reading!</p>
