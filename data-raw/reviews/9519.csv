"CapnRex101","2012-06-03T14:43:16.117Z","8831 (5) - Ocean King","<p>In my opinion the Ocean King (either Poseidon or Neptune) is one of the stand out figures of this series. He is a great character to recreate in Lego form and his Minifigure&nbsp;does&nbsp;not disappoint in the slightest. He includes one fantastic new mould for his combined crown and hairpiece and the overall look of the figure is simply excellent. Several fairly rare parts are included too which only sweetens the deal and the&nbsp;playability&nbsp;is great so the figure should appeal to younger buyers as well as people who wish to display them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The combined hair and crown piece is brand new and looks absolutely spectacular,&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;suitably regal for this god of the sea! His hair is white and is somewhat similar to the hair seen on newer Luke Skywalker Minifigures in set 7565, Millennium Falcon and set 7879, Hoth Echo Base. The crown area of the sculpt is awesome too as it is moulded to look as though it is made from conical shells which is a nice touch. This area is metallic gold in colour and looks really excellent. The piece looks just as he appears in films and mythical illustrations which is great.</p><p>His face print is partially obscured by the beard he has but it still looks good. He has a very serious expression on his face and a few wrinkles around his eyes as well as bushy white eyebrows. His face could be re-used for elderly Minifigures in other themes such as Lego City making it quite useful.</p><p>He also comes with a white beard which is exactly the same as the one sported by Sensei Wu in the Ninjago theme. It looks very mystical due to how it is cast to look as though it is blowing in the breeze and combines a beard and long moustache in one piece which look fantastic. It is a great touch on this figure and is visually far better than if his beard had been printed on his face or another beard piece had been used.</p><p>His torso is quite plain with just a bare chest. His muscles are printed on the front but there is no back printing. It is very similar to the Surfer's torso from Series 2, but on this occasion has slightly more detail and definition. This too however is mostly obscured by his fantastic beard.</p><p>Just like his most common appearances in mythology, this&nbsp;incarnation&nbsp;of the lord of the ocean has a fish's tail. It is the same mould as was seen in set 4194, Whitecap Bay from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme, but this time it has a bit less detail with groups of shiny silver scales printed on the front. The tail looks fantastic swished back behind the figure and allows the figure to be placed on the black stand included with all&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, he comes with a golden trident, a necessity for any self respecting god of the sea! It is made of a very slightly rubbery plastic and is cast in pearl gold. An identical piece was seen in the Atlantis theme and it looks very nice being held by the figure.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a Minifigure I would certainly recommend. There is potential for play with this figure, as well as display. Some people construct small environments for their Collectable Minifigures and this guy would look fantastic with a rock or beach to stand on, looking out over his domain! The components that make up the figure are lovely, the crown and hair piece in particular. That piece alone makes this figure a must have in my opinion. I can find no flaws with this figure and think it is one of the best from this wave.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Firox_5000","2012-07-22T17:39:05.16Z","King Neptune ","This was the third mini figure I found while buying a load of series 7 figures. The figure took me around 30 seconds to build and as quick as the build was delivered a quick but amusing build.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The figure like most of this wonderful series comes with some exciting parts some of which are new. The main piece is the neptune tail. While this clearly isn't a new piece it is definitely an interesting one as it hasn't been seen in a while and really suites the figure. He also comes with a crown with connected white hair which is a new piece and this is a wonderful addition to the figure and a clever piece too. He also comes with a beard piece too which does the job well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The figure also includes a trident piece which isn't new but is a wonderful piece and very neat. He also has a chest printed on his chest which is mostly hidden by his beard.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This figure is definitely one of the best in series 7 and easily in the top three due to unique parts and also being a cool original new idea and has been done well. I would recommend this set to anyone who likes underwater and aqua themed lego sets and any one after a representable figure of neptune and anyone after the series 7 figures. This is definitely one of the figures I would recommend getting if you aren't able to collect all sixteen figures.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T17:48:15.187Z","Ruler of All The Oceans!","<p>Set #8831 Ocean King: This is a clever way to re-use the unique Mermaid Tail from Pirates of the Carribean, and a very interesting choice for LEGO to include with their Collectible Mini-Figure collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ocean King must be one of the few Collectible Mini-Figures to use a lot of unique new pieces, with exception to the head and torso everything else has been either used in only a few sets or for specific types of Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hair piece is brand new, it's colored white, since the Ocean King is an elderly fellow, and has molded on crown pieces. The crown design actually looks like conch shells, those spiral shells favored by Hermit Crabs (if I remember my Ocean Lifeforms right.) and looks highly detailed. His facial print is done in a scowling frown, with age lines crinkling around his eyes and smart looking white eyebrows to match his hair. To further signify that he is old, he includes Sensei Wu's beard. It makes for a nice change of pace rather than using the old wizard's beard for an old man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The torso is another bare chested Mini-Figure torso print, this one might even be better suited for MOCers looking for plain bare chests than the Jungle Boy one, it shows some obvious muscle, this Ocean King must work out a lot protecting his realm. The Mermaid tail piece is the same one from the PotC stuff if I'm not mistaken, and has a nice printing of scales. I'm actually really impressed by the level of detail on this piece. Lastly, the Ocean King includes a trident from the LEGO Atlantis theme... Or maybe not, it looks to be a different piece, I could be wrong though, but it isn't as soft and rubbery as the tridents that came with the Atlantis sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'd say this guy is one you can't pass up, he'd make a great nemesis for some of your Pirate Mini-Figures who dare trespass in his domain, and with that tail of his he's pretty easy to feel out amongs all the others. Get him if you can.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"legolover2001","2013-10-03T06:32:17.74Z","8831-5: Ocean King","<p>Today we have the Ocean King in my cryptozooolgy LEGO reviews. The Mermen (or as their Latin name Pischomina Nympha) are half-man-half-fish and live mainly in coastal waters. This was the first ever collectible minifigures Merperson created by LEGO. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The packet is red and had the normal group of minifigures (Hippe, Viking Woman, Bunny Suit Guy, Rocker Girl, Aztec Warrior, Bagpiper, Galaxy Patrol, Ocean King and Evil Knight) and on the back it has the usual B-O-R-I-N-G stuff. The instuctions has are just the same as most minifigures, has a list of the figures and on the back it shows you how to put it together.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You get a few nice parts in the set. Of course there is the Mer-tail, the headpiece and the sensi beard.<br></p><h4>Minifigure</h4><p>Now for the actual minifigure. The 'tail' is (I think) the first of it's type (now included in several other sets) and it has printing of silver scales scattered around. the torso is bare with a large 'six pack' and bare arms. The head is rather nice as it is an old man head (I love them), he has a scowling face with white large bushy eyebrows. His hair(s) are a sensi beard which is found in ninjago sets and long white hair with a et look on which holds a golden sea shell crown. His accessories are a golden trident which is cool and your regular black minifigure stand.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>What do you think?&nbsp;<h4>The completed model</h4><p>He looks rather nice in a beach or underwater MOC and maybe even a sideshow and if you put him next to the series 9 mermaid then it's pretty cool. Maybe you could make an underwater city populated by merpeople!<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Altogether, this is a minifig but I if were you I would try and find the computer programmer or the hippe. &nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-04-27T23:39:34.75Z","FANTASTIC!","<p>The fifth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Ocean Master. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair-crown combo, which was new to the figure. I&#39;m in love with how the piece turned out, and I want to talk about all the amazing details it has. First off, I love that golden crown on top, with the 5 sea-shell spirals, which I think are printed instead of dual-moulded. And behind that crown is some fantastic white hair moulding. I love how long it is at the back, and all around, I love the piece so much.</p>

<p>Next is his head piece, which I just love so much. It features an angry, old expression, with the white, bushy&nbsp;eyebrows. Normally if the face is covered by a mask or beard they aren&#39;t too detailed, but the face on this dude is generally good. I like the grimace, as well as the wrinkles beside the mouth, and he even has some wrinkles beside the eyes. He has no alternate face, which is alright.</p>

<p>Next is his beard, which is a simply fantastic piece overall. I just love the three points at the bottom, and how they curve outward, and I also love how the mouth is moulded into the beard. The colour being white is really great as well. I don&#39;t know if it was new to the figure, so, as I&#39;ve said in other reviews, if it&#39;s new for the figure, that&#39;s great, and if not, that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features a great, muscular design. I love the printing for his abs, with that 6-pack and all. He has no back torso printing, which it would&#39;ve been cool to get more muscle detail, but it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is that tailpiece, which is a re-use of the mermaid tailpiece from the Pirates of the Caribbean line in 2011. It fits the figure here very nicely, and I just love the curvature of it, down to how the fin at the tip of his tail curve outward, and I like the scale printing on the front of it. It&#39;s all caste in sand green as well, which I love so much.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessory, which is that trident. I love that piece, and I like how it has the three tips on top, and I even like the detail at the base of the staff. Of course, the colouring of it is great as well, being that pearl gold design. I don&#39;t quite know if it was new to the figure, but nonetheless, it&#39;s a great piece.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, the design of this is fantastic, and I love how all his pieces are great in their own way, and the concept of having an ocean master in a CMF series is great. This figure is perhaps my second or third favourite of the series, and I just really love how he came out. But that&#39;s&nbsp;it for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
