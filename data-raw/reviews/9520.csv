"Lich_Barrister","2012-05-10T02:07:56.517Z","Show's over...","I've only picked up a quarter of the series so far, but this one easily resides in the top flight with the Space Marine, Aztec, and Computer Programmer. I've a particular inclination to theatrical and cultural minifigs, granted, but this is an excellent minifig: nice accessories, new torso and dress, a fantastic ""hat &amp; hair"" piece, and perhaps my new favorite female head. The dual face of ""annoyed warrior"" and ""operatic singing person"" is worth the price - particularly if you're looking for variety in your minifig faces.<div><br></div><div>I still don't quite understand how so many of these minifigs end up so low.

"CapnRex101","2012-06-05T17:10:24.173Z","8831 (13) - Viking Woman","<p>This Minifigure is one of my favourites of Series 7. She is perfect in every way, detailed printing, plenty of playability, lovely&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;and even a wonderful new piece! It is great to see a character like this being recreated in Lego and she goes very nicely with the Viking from Series 4 of course for extra play opportunities. The brand new mould for this figure is the excellent hair piece which looks amazing. It really is an absolute delight and I think it suits the figure very nicely indeed.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start with the new combined helmet and hair piece, The helmet section of the piece is very similar to the older Viking helmet but without a nose guard right down to the holes for Lego tooth pieces on either side to create Viking horns. These horns look excellent and despite their historical inaccuracy, are obligatory for a Viking character. I like the bolts moulded in to the helmet which make it look very realistic. The metallic silver colour of the helmet also contributes to its realism. The hair is blonde and braided into two pony tails down the back of the figure. Her hair is very long, reaching right down to the bottom of the figure's torso! The hair has lots of texture moulded into it which makes it look superb, so good in fact, hat this is one of my favourite parts from any Collectable Minifigure as yet! I would love to see the Viking theme&nbsp;resurrected&nbsp;as a replacement for the Kingdoms theme, which sadly seems to be on its way out, and parts like this could be reproduced featuring other hair colours.</p><p>Her head is printed on both sides, one with an angry scowl as though she is going in to battle, the other with a much more peaceful expression which makes her look like she is singing. Both sides feature long eyelashes, eyebrows and pale pink lips.</p><p>The torso is printed with lots of detail. At the top some skin is visible and her dress is held on by buttons with gold patterns on them which contrast nicely with the dull brown fabric of her outfit. Hanging from these gold clips she has two necklaces made of various stones. She is wearing a thick golden belt as well with similar buttons as the top of the torso, and one large central decorative plate in the middle of these buttons. Her arms are dark tan and she has yellow hands. There is no back printing on this figure which would be the only improvement I can think of if I could change something about the figure. Of course, being a female Minifigure, she has the standard feminine curves.</p><p>Her skirt piece is formed by a brown slope and has a continuation of the torso printing on it, with some folds in the cloth, and some nice tan rope work too. I am a fan of the use of this piece as a skirt as I think it looks fairly realistic, although it does make the figure somewhat taller than most.</p><p>She comes&nbsp;with&nbsp;two accessories, the&nbsp;first&nbsp;of which is a slightly shiny light grey sword which is also seen with the Gladiator from Series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures where it was a Gladius. It looks very nice in this colour, yet another thing I like about the figure!</p><p>The shield she holds is plain brown with no printing. I would complain about the lack of detail on here, however we are lucky to have got one at all I think as Lego did not have to include one, but they did anyway.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Basically, I think this Minifigure is an absolute must have. Do not miss out and get it while you can would be my advice as I can see this figure being snapped up fast. I have no real complaints and am glad to award it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-04T21:46:04.23Z","a decent figure!","<p>The thirteenth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Viking Woman. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes&nbsp;10 pieces. Also, before we begin, this is a gender swap of the Series 4 Viking, so keep that in mind. But let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that helmet-hair combo, which was new to the figure. That piece looks so incredible, and is my favourite part of this figure. Let&#39;s break down all the details. First off, I love the shiny silver helmet on top, and it even has some moulding on the front. Those white horns on the sides are separate pieces, and can be plugged into the sides via a pole&nbsp;connection; I love how those look. And then moving down, we have the hair section of it, which has some amazing detail. I love how it covers the sides of her head piece, and I love all the wavy moulding on the front; and then the back of the hair has even more fantastic detail. I love how she has two braids, and the moulding on both sides is amazing. I like hw the hair is a light tan colour as well.</p>

<p>Next we have her face, which features not one, but two great expressions. The first expression is that angry look, and I love how it&#39;s very useful outside the setting. Then her alternate expression, is pretty great as well, which is a very cheerful expression. I like the variety of having both an angry and happy face, and again, the happy expression is useful outside the setting.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which I suppose has some great printed details. I like the belt design, as well as all the detail around her collar. And for some reason, I&#39;m crazy about the fact that she has different coloured arms, being caste in that light brown colour. But, like several others in the series, she has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next is her dress, and I like the printing on that, where we do have that stitched&nbsp;design towards the bottom. I also like the wrinkles on the bottom of her dress, and there&#39;s even a few wrinkles on the top.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her two accessories, both of which are great inclusions. I love that small sword in one hand, being caste completely in grey, and, while I wish it had printing, her shield is a nice accessory as well. I also really like the deep brown colour of that shield.</p>

<p>But that is it for this figure! Overall, this is one of my least favourites of the series; however, she isn&#39;t bad. I actually really love her hair piece, and her head is great as well. But in the end, being a gender swap, she just doesn&#39;t feel very original, and her concept is slightly boring. Still, her hair is pretty great, so I&#39;m gonna be giving her a 3 out of 5. That&#39;s all for this review, and thanks for reading!</p>
