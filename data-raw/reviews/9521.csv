"CapnRex101","2012-06-12T07:15:25.367Z","8831 (6) - Bagpiper","<p>The Bagpiper is one of my favourite Minifigures of Series 7, it features an amazing three brand new pieces and is printed just about everywhere with vast amounts of detail. To see such an icon of Scotland recreated in Lego is fantastic and it really does look extremely realistic which is very impressive. The new parts alone make it worth having and it looks excellent on display as well as having some potential for playability so in all respects this Minifigure is really top notch.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hat he wears is an incredible accessory. It features some of the most detailed printing I have ever seen on a Lego piece which looks great. Not only is the printing wonderful, but the mould of the piece is as well, it is cast in black and the sides of the hat are left unprinted. However the top of the piece is printed all over with a lovely tartan pattern including red, green and white striping, all of which are printed to look like stitching and it is actually very much like the designs you see on hats worn by Bagpipers in reality. It is also topped with a traditional Scottish Toorie (the spherical bit on top) which is red and matches the other colours on the piece very well indeed. The piece is cast to be slightly sagged over the head of the Minifigure which makes it look very natural and is a great bit of detail which Lego have taken the time to factor into their&nbsp;design&nbsp;for this component.</p><p>The head is also superb, it features a serious expression and some heavy grey and white eyebrows which make the musician look quite elderly. There are also a few wrinkles around his eyes which look good. The look of this&nbsp;face&nbsp;makes it very suitable for inclusion as the head of an elderly inhabitant of your Lego City if you wanted to create such a character.</p><p>The torso is also highly detailed like the rest of the figure with a black waistcoat and jacket over a white shirt. The jacket and waistcoat are both printed with buttons and he is also wearing a green tie to match the green on his hat, bagpipes and kilt. This is very much like what Bagpipers wear in reality and is a great addition to an already wonderful Minifigure. There is no back printing, the arms are plain black and his hands are yellow.</p><p>Another of the new components to come with this figure is the brand new cloth kilt. It is just the right shape when it is on the Minifigure and fits well between the legs and torso of the Minifigure once it has been folded correctly. It is printed with just as much detail as the torso, hat and bagpipes and carries on the&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;tartan&nbsp;designs&nbsp;as well as the green, red and white&nbsp;colour scheme. No Scottish gentleman would be complete without his kilt when he is in formal attire, so to have a kilt recreated in Lego is very nice.</p><p>Even the legs of this incredible Minifigure are printed with lots of detail. The hips and legs are cast in white, but on the legs there is yellow printing of where his skin is visible. This yellow printing goes through the middle of the legs and leaves two white areas, the first of&nbsp;which&nbsp;is made to look like briefs. I found this quite funny and was surprised that Lego went to such&nbsp;lengths&nbsp;to achieve a realistic&nbsp;interpretation&nbsp;of an&nbsp;archetypal Scotsman. The second area of white on the legs&nbsp;are his long socks, which are printed with a green chequered pattern at the top of each one, another lovely detail. When the kilt is on, it stretches to just above the green pattern on his socks from just above his hips.</p><p>The final part, and probably my favourite, is the delightful bagpipes piece. This is an instrument which has been integral to Scottish music for many years and you frequently see musicians of this nature in historic Scottish cities so it was a must have if Lego wanted to make a really perfect interpretation of the character. For a Lego piece it is amazing that the unique shape of the instrument has been captured so well from the bag which stores the air, to the pipes which blow it out, all of the details are here. Not only is the mould incredible, but the printing on the piece is fantastic as well. This printing consists of a green and white tartan pattern which has a similar appearance of being stitched on as the hat so it looks incredibly realistic. The Minifigure can hold the piece using a handle which allows his mouth to line up perfectly with the blowpipe which found next to the rest of the pipes. This is one of the best pieces I think we have had from any Collectable Minifigure from any series so far and I absolutely love them.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This Minifigure really is an absolute must have for the bagpipes and hat alone, but as a whole no part of the Minifigure lets it down in the slightest and I will be picking up a couple more of these guys to make a small band for the streets of my Lego City. The playability is there, but not perhaps to such an extent as it is with some other Minifigures. However I am not going to knock a point off because the parts are the best from any&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigure in my opinion, which more than make up for the slight lack of playability. The figure is one of the best for display and is a great piece for anyone to own so I highly recommend it to all.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

The figure compared to the others took longer to build as the laying of the skir,I mean new kilt piece seemed quite a challenge.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The overall figure already looking at it is certainly one of the best from series 7 and comes with many new pieces including the new kilt piece which is a nice touch while as already mentioned a more tricky build because of it. There is also a very neat looking scottish like hat the figure comes with some fascinating patterns of red and white and is a new piece.

"middleton83","2012-06-22T18:16:58.65Z","The Bagpiper review","<p>I thought It was a good model at first, but then when it came to one of the new elements of lego, (The kilt that is made of fabric, amazing right) I was getting annoyed with it because it was quite difficult to put on, and even my friends were gettting annoyed with it, but after about 10 minutes of trying to put his kilt on we finally did it.</p>
<p>I do not think that this would be a good toy to add to your lego city collection because of that one component, and if he had his legs ripped off, (Because he had a very bad accident or something) the kilt just comes flying off.Therefore not making playability very good, but otherwise it was fine.</p>
<p>So inconclusion I would say that it is a good model but it may frustrate you, and to LEGO, please fix the kilt piece or improve it or something because we thought it was quite annoying but still good, so perhaps it should stay as it is for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But overall, I give it a,&nbsp;4 out of 5.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
"sideswinger","2021-05-01T15:54:39.507Z","one of my FAVOURITE CMF's EVER!","<p>The sixth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Bagpiper, and he was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. Fair warning: this is one of my favourite CMF figures ever, so I&#39;m gonna gush a lot abut this figure. But anyway, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hat piece, which was new for the figure. And the gushing begins, as that piece is downright amazing, with the black colouring being great, the roundness of it being great, and all around, it&#39;s just so great! The top of it is smooth, which allows for some extremely impressive printing to be printed on top. That little red tuft of fur is not only moulded, but again, some red is printed onto it, and some plaid printing on it covers the entire top. I mean wow, do I love the look of it! However, though it is close, it isn&#39;t even my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a fantastic print. I love how grumpy he looks, with the frown, as well as the great wrinkles around the eyes, and the wa his eyebrows are arched is great. I also love how the eyebrows are that dark grey colour, with the white on top and dark grey on bottom, and I like how there&#39;s even a little crease between them. He has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay, since the one included here is great.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, and it can&#39;t really be seen from Brickset&#39;s image, so you&#39;ll have to take my word for this one. The printing on the torso is surprising&nbsp;fantastic, and it;&#39;s a very fancy suit and tie, with a black jacket over it. The tie&nbsp;itself is a very nice green colour, and the undershirt is white; it all comes together pretty well. He has no back torso printing, which is okay.</p>

<p>I suppose the next thing to discuss would be that Scottish kilt, which is a cloth piece, and it looks fantastic, with all the plaid printing, as well as the red, white, and green colour scheme. The kilt goes all the way around the legs, and it&#39;s a fantastic inclusion for the figure. I&#39;m so glad LEGO added the cloth kilt instead of just printing it, and I think they made a great choice about that, as it looks fantastic.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, which didn&#39;t need printing at all. LEGO could&#39;ve left them plain white, and I wouldn&#39;t have been upset one bit. But LEGO actually printed those legs, which is mind-blowing to me. It has some green diamond printing on front, which is visible even with that kilt on, and there&#39;s some yellow flesh under it as well, which is a fantastic little touch to the figure. Overall, the fact that LEGO printed the figures is great, and it makes the figure even better.</p>

<p>But at last, we come to his accessory, which is the bagpipes. Those might be my single favourite piece in any CMF figure. They&#39;re my favourite part of the figure, and oh wow. I can&#39;t express how much I love them, and to be honest, I don&#39;t even know why I love it so much. The way it curves is great, the way the handle is placed, the way the pipes jut out the top, the way some parts of it jut out, the way the pipe lines up expertly with the mouth... I could seriously go on and on about it. I love the plaid printing on the front of it as well, and all in all, boy, it is so fantastic, and obviously, it was new for the figure.</p>

<p>Overall, that&#39;s all for this figure, and as I said at the beginning, this is one of my favourite CMF&#39;s ever. It actually might&nbsp;be my favourite of all. I&#39;m not saying it definitely is, but it has a chance of it. I&#39;ve already said why I love this figure, and for once, it does feel like a 3 dollar figure to me. Also, it&#39;s hands-down my favourite in&nbsp;the series. So that&#39;s it for this review! I know it was long, so thanks for reading!</p>
