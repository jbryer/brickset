"CapnRex101","2012-06-08T18:06:04.85Z","8831 (10) - Jungle Boy","<p>The Jungle Boy is a figure which features no new parts, which is something of a rarity when it comes to the Collectable Minifigures series, and in my view detracts from the figure when it is compared to others from each series. This Minifigure is nice, but like a couple of other figures from this series, it is far from outstanding due to the lack of brand new moulds. I am nevertheless quite impressed with how this Minifigure has been created and it far exceeds my expectations for it. There is plenty of detail which is a big advantage, and even better than that, is the really excellent play opportunities which come with this Minifigure.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hairpiece has not in fact been seen in this reddish brown colour before and I quite like it. In the past it has always been dark brown which was nice, but I prefer this personally. It suits the Minifigure perfectly and looks&nbsp;appropriately bedraggled for a boy raised in the jungle. Not only does it look good on this Minifigure, but it also is neutral enough to fit nicely on many other custom figures as well making it quite useful.</p><p>His head is printed on only one side with a big smile, brown eyebrows and two lines to add more definition to his cheeks. All in all a nicely printed component.</p><p>His torso is highly detailed with a bare muscular torso which features plenty of muscle definition and some scratches (which have presumably been caused by a Sabretooth Tiger or something of that sort) which are a very neat touch on the part of Lego which I think really adds a bit of character to the Minifigure. He also wears a black necklace with three white teeth hanging from it which is nice. There is no back printing and his arms and hands are bare.</p><p>His legs are also printed with a brown loincloth which goes down to around his knees and is torn and very rugged looking like his hair. His hips piece is solid brown with no printing. A few fold lines in the cloth are also printed which adds a bit more detail.</p><p>Two dark grey knives are included on a sprue for the figure to hold. He can only hold one if you want him to hold the monkey included leaving one spare to give to another figure if you like which can be useful. I like these knives as they have some great banding on the handle which is nicely moulded in making them look quite realistic.</p><p>The monkey is a piece I really have a soft spot for. I absolutely love it and although this is not the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time we have seen it, it came with the Zookeeper in Series 5, and it is exactly the same as this one. It is superbly detailed with some very nice detailed moulding and tan printing on his face and ears. The monkey can sit on studs as it has a hole beneath it to fit on a stud and can be carried by the figure by its right arm which is held above its head. It is a great inclusion and I am very glad to see the piece again.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a Minifigure which I do recommend, but i you can only get a few figures from each series, this one can be missed. I like it, but there is nothing which&nbsp;makes&nbsp;it really stand out of the crowd of excellent Minifigures from this theme. The playability of this Minifigure is excellent, especially when combined with the Caveman from Series 1 and Cave Woman from Series 5. This figure is ideal to have swinging through the trees if you have the pieces required to make it and it could be displayed very nicely indeed.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

It's not my favourite but it's still a good one, because it reminds me a lot of Tarzan.

We also get two knives with this set which is really useful for some cool MOC's and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to

"Firox_5000","2012-07-22T16:07:02.313Z","Lego Tarzan","This was one of the first figures I came across on my randomly selected first lot of series seven figures.

"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T17:22:22.54Z","Him Tarzan.","<p>Set #8831 Jungle Boy: Another chance at getting&nbsp;a chimp, and a rather odd choice for LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jungle Boy is not my all time favorite of the Mini-Figures that have been produced since the beginning of this Theme, I honestly wasn't too thrilled when I got it. And then I wound up picking up a duplicate because I failed to listen to my gut when I felt the chimp in the package, the chimp does make it easier to identify him. However, as this is a review let us try to remain positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure himself might not be to everyone's liking, however the parts are definitely nice to have. He comes with Prince Dastan's hair piece in a light brown tone, his facial print is a nice looking one with short brown eyebrows, and his cheeks have clearly defined structure because he's showing a big toothy smile.</p>
<p>His torso only has the one sided print, that of a bare chested male with a small animal tooth necklace, this is a great piece for MOCers. He's also got a loin-cloth print on his legs, this is colored a dark brown, the front of the legs look fine with this print, the back... Well let's just say perhaps this is one of the rare few Mini-Figures who could have had brown added to the upper thighs paint wise, he kind of looks like he's wearing a dark brown thong. (Not that you'd notice anyway unless you have an unhealthy fixation with staring at Mini-Figures from the back.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessory-wise he includes two daggers first introduced I believe with the Prince of Persia Theme, it's nice to see them getting some use, although I think I would have preferred to see the not-quite Tarzan here with some kind of spear. And he has a chimp, the same exact mold that came with the Zoo Keeper, if you already bought a ton of those for your LEGO Animal collection I'd have to say you really don't want to have more than one of this guy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Jungle Boy is a really dissapointing choice as far as Mini-Figures go, he's not boo-why LEGO why! cringe inducing, but he is a tad plain and kind of doesn't really fit in with any of LEGO's current Themes for display, except maybe Studios. I do reccomend him though if you want some parts for MOCing bare chested Mini-Figs, of course you'll have an army of chimps doing this, but I'm certain a talented MOCer can find a use even for that particular part.</p>",TRUE,2,3,1,3,2
"sideswinger","2021-05-02T22:45:42.2Z","worst of the series...","<p>The tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is Jungle Boy. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that shoulder-length hair piece caste in dark brown. I don&#39;t know if it was new to the figure, but it fits him extremely well. I like how shaggy it looks, and the colour in reddish-brown&nbsp;is fitting as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which looks pretty good. I like that little cut in his eyebrow, and I also like the cheekbones. He has that big, cheeky smile as well, which is pretty great. He has no alternate printing, which is okay.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and it has some great detail. I really like his necklace around his neck, with the three white claws, and I love those scratches on his chest. The various muscles printed on it is also great. But it stinks that he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, and the printing on them is pretty good. I like how the top section is dark brown and how it has those brown flaps of wool printed on the two bottom sections. Of course this was before dual-moulded legs, which makes his backside look dangerously exposed. But still, all jokes aside, the legs are great.</p>

<p>Next is his accessories, and he has technically two. The knife in his hand is a two pack, so two knives are included. I think it&#39;s a fitting accessory, though I wish it would&#39;ve been caste in a more interesting colour; and his other accessory is that monkey, which is the same exact piece found and introduced with the Series 5 Zookeeper. I like the printing on the front of the face, as well as on his ears, and of course, it&#39;s an extremely fitting accessory, though it&#39;s not at all exclusive.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, I think this is a fantastic concept, and it&#39;s executed pretty perfectly; but at the same time, he just isn&#39;t that interesting. While the monkey really fits, it isn&#39;t exclusive or new at all, and the other pieces, while they aren&#39;t terrible and really fit the figure, they just aren&#39;t that special. And also, I think this is my least favourite of the series. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give him a 2. I don&#39;t hate him, but he just isn&#39;t very interesting. But that&#39;s it for this review! And thanks for reading!</p>
