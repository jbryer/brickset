When I opened this at the hotel I was staying at, I felt quite saddened that I had picked up something much more disappointing that the other two minifigures I had picked up. I definitely don't think of this as a horrible minifig, but it honestly just isn't that great.&nbsp;</div><p></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-At least I can have a tennis match with my man and woman tennis figs; it's just too bad that they're my least favorite in the collection.&nbsp;</li><li>-The printed uniform is awesome; it looks as though this guy is actually going to play tennis&nbsp;professionally.</li><li>-I like the cartoonish hair that Mr. Tennis sports, since it basically looks as though this guy has actually been playing tennis.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The idea has been done much more than once, I'm sure, but it isn't an effective redo.&nbsp;</li><li>-The face of Mr. Tennis definitely doesn't look like he's happy to play tennis. Add some sweat, and&nbsp;I'll be convinced.&nbsp;</li><li>-Back printing has definitely not taken place on the leg piece. It definitely detriments the minifigure as a whole.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>The first time I saw this figure, I knew what to expect, and I was perfectly right; this minifigure is mediocre to a few that have been released in the theme's history, including a couple from Series 7. It just could have been better if thought was put into it. If you have the&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;not to get this, consider yourself luckier. If you dig tennis, though, then good luck. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3

I also recommend this to those collecting the collectable mini figure series and series seven too.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-02T20:34:18.36Z","Mixed Doubles","<p>Set #8831 Tennis Ace: The first Tennis Player was a Female Mini-Fig, now in Series 7 LEGO has provided a male counterpart to create mixed doubles.</p>
<p>The Tennis Ace features an awesome tennis uniform print which is unfortunatley single-sided for the torso, he's got the typical white shorts and vest with green accents. His face features a determined looking teeth gritting expression and he's also wearing a headband. The hairpiece we've seen before with the Sleepyhead, this time its blonde. His accessory is a blue version of the tennis racket.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say the Tennis Ace is a welcome addition to the sports themed group of the Collectible Mini-Figs, with accurate detailing for the sport and perfect for MOCing a tennis court in your LEGO City collection. Mini-Figure enthusiasts won't want to miss out this opportunity to create a mixed doubles tournament either.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-11T09:21:20.337Z","8831 (9) - Tennis Ace","<p>The Tennis Ace is a slightly bizarre choice for a Minifigure in my opinion given that we saw another Tennis Player in Series 3, but now that I have him, he is not actually nearly as poor as I was expecting given the photos I saw prior to his release. Of course tennis is a sport for two (or four) players so without this guy the sportswoman from Series 3 would have nobody to play against! It may have no new moulds but it does have a lot of playability and having originally totally written it off as one of the worst Minifigures of Series 7, my opinion of this figure has definitely improved.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start with my favourite of the pieces which constitute this Minifigure, the lovely blonde hair piece. This mould was first seen in Series 6 with the Sleepyhead where we saw it in reddish brown. I think the cast suits this tan colour more and it looks great on the figure. This is a part which could be very useful for any male Minifigure really, but I think it looks best on Mandalorians from Star Wars when they are not wearing their helmets as it is very much like some of the hairstyles you see them sporting in the show.</p><p>His head is printed on only one side with a white sweat band around his forehead and a very determined expression. He also has eyebrows which just about match his hair colour. I quite like the head and it is certainly appropriate for this character. There is a fair amount of detail on the sweat band with a slightly rough edge to give the impression of it being made of a fabric, I really appreciate little tiny details like this one.</p><p>His torso is also fairly good, it is mostly white but the top half has a light green section with some white striping running through it. He has an open collar which shows some of his yellow skin beneath it and there is also a green stripe at the bottom of the torso. There is no back printing and his arms are white with bare yellow hands.</p><p>Both the hips and legs are printed which is excellent. The hips have a section of two green stripes on them which is then continued onto the legs. The Tennis Ace is wearing shorts so these green stripes only go part of the way down before the white area of his legs comes to an end. It then gives way to a small area of yellow printing where his skin is visible, before the white returns for his trainers. The yellow skin area is also printed on the sides of each of his legs so it looks good from the side as well as from the front.</p><p>The final piece included with the Tennis Ace is his racket. It appeared before in Series 3 with the Tennis Player and since then has not been seen. Previously it was cast in white, but now it is dark blue which looks lovely. The area of the tennis strings are nicely detailed with lots of small holes which looks quite realistic and for such a small piece, holds an awful lot of detail! There is also some banding detail on the handle which is nice.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a figure which I would recommend, particularly if you have the Tennis Player from Series 3, but not nearly as highly as many of the others from this series. It is one which can be passed on, but it is a decent Minifigure and if you have the other Tennis Player, or even another copy of this figure there is plenty of fun to be had. You could even set up a Tennis tournament in your Lego City if you wish! Due to the lack of anything really ground breaking and outstanding here, I am going to award the Minifigure with a perfectly respectable score of...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 7/10</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-02T15:16:22.32Z","not as BAD as I THOUGHT!","<p>The ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Tennis Ace. He was released in 2012, retailed for three bucks, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that spiky hair piece, which I&nbsp;believe was new for the figure. I really love the colouring of it, being that light tan tone, and it looks fantastic on the figure as well. Also, the piece was slightly uncommon back then, so getting it in a new colour was pretty great, back in the day. And again, it&#39;s a bit uncommon in that colour nowadays as well. I think the hair might be my favourite part of this whole figure.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which features a pretty great print. It would&#39;ve been nice to have gotten an alternate expression that looks a bit more cheerful, but oh well. That face print included is not bad, and I like how it has that white band across his forehead. I like how competitive he looks as well.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which is pretty good. This is a gender swap of the Series 3 Tennis Player, which had blue on the top of her shirt; I like how this figure, rather, has green on the top. I like how it has that white line in the green, as well as the green line on the bottom of the torso. He has no back printing, however, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, and I do really like the printing on them. I like the green lines on both of his legs, and I also like how the yellow flesh is not only printed on the front, but the sides as well.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his tennis racket. That piece was introduced in Series 3, but it does have a new colour here, being that dark blue-green colour, or just dark blue. I love seeing it in that colour, and it&#39;s a pretty great piece overall, with the holes in it, and even the detail on the handle. And of course, it&#39;s the most fitting accessory ever!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I normally turn away from gender swaps, and this isn&#39;t the best gender swap out there. But I must say, this is pretty far from the worst. I actually like this figure, upon taking a closer look. Sure, he lacks back torso printing, but that&#39; a problem with almost every 2010-2012 minifigure; and no, he isn&#39;t worth 3 dollars, but that&#39;s a problem with almost every CMF ever. So in the end, while this is far from my favourite in the series, and maybe even one of my least favourites, it isn&#39;t half bad, and I actually like how he came out, for being a gender swap. But that&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
