"BRICKBOY74","2012-06-02T16:51:31.997Z","One of the top 5 in value for series 7","<p>This minifig is great for a somewhat common minifig. Great Playability for a lone minifig. Might not be the greatest minifig in England :]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cape is not the greatest idea to be alone in the bag. It could get folded. The printing on the torso is great. The visor is a nice blue color. The helmet also has great printing on the top. I also love the double sided face. Wish the torso had back printing even though it would be under the cape. I also love the hip printing. Just like the alien conquest aliens it has a weird line pattern on the sides going down to the hip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a minifig. For first time builders the helmet build, and getting the helmet on the hand could be hard to do for people with big fingers. :/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great set to get and has great playabilltiy for kids. We also, get a rare white cape. (And my first cape in a set I bought new)</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,4

The figure took a very quick 30 seconds to build and didn't really deliver too much of a building experience.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The figure itself comes what appears to be a new groovy looking hair do with slight spiking at the front as well as a printed helmet which has a star and circle on the top and is a nice touch to the figure which can be swapped when the figure is or isn't doing stunts [although holder the other can be hard when placing it on the figure].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He also comes with a white clock to make him look more dare devil like &nbsp;and &nbsp;his &nbsp;nicely printed chest and legs also have some nicely printed stripes and star logo appearing on there which are very nice touches.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall perhaps not the best in the series but not the worst figure.

"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T17:33:49.853Z","Look Out! It's Super Dave! (Kinda)","<p>Set #8831 Daredevil: Now here's a great Mini-Figure from Series 7, much better than my previously reviewed Jungle Boy, I think this one is a definite must have and a great choice from LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Daredevil is just plain fun, first off he's got the same hair piece the Mechanic had before, was it Series 5? This time it's a light, almost dirty blonde color, and his facial print matches the style quite cleverly with a drooping mustache and eyebrows. Plus that big, I'm cool, smile he's got going on.</p>
<p>His entire body is made to resemble a fancy looking professional stunt driver's outfit. The base plastic is white, then the front of the torso has red, blue and a touch of gold on the print showing off his fancy duds. Well just look at that picture up there, or to the left/right on this very page, you can clearly see the level of detail LEGO put so much care into when coming up with his torso print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His pants continue to show some great printing, in fact he's even got knee-pads, that is correct, this Mini-Figure is wearing two blue knee-pads to protect himself when performing any sort of stunt. There's also a nice belt design with the Mini-Figure's initials. (Though I'm not sure what his name is meant to be, it's hard to make out such tiny writing.) Besides all of this he also includes a white cape and protective helmet, on the top of the helmet is printed the same star design that must be his logo, or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this Mini-Figure is a great addition to any LEGO Collection and has some highly impressive detail for such a tiny surface structure, sadly he isn't double-sided, but really with that cape on he doesn't need to be. I strongly suggest you get him if you haven't done so already.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-03T05:31:46.303Z","8831 (7) - Daredevil","<p>In the Collectable Minifigures theme it has become the normality to see at&nbsp;least&nbsp;one new mould come with each character. The only complaint I have with this figure, is that it does not, so cannot be up there with the best Minifigures of the series in my opinion. Despite the lack of any new pieces, this is still a very nice Minifigure with a lot of highly detailed printing and a superb white cape!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>I will begin with the nice helmet the Daredevil comes with. It is just the same as previous crash helmets we have seen, for instance in the Race Car Driver from Series 3. However on this occasion the piece is cast in white and is printed on the top with a large red five-pointed star with a blue circle going around it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A translucent blue visor is included which can be attached to the helmet. Once it is attached it is possible to raise and lower the visor which can offer more posing opportunities.</div><div><br></div><div>A hairpiece is also included which is the same Elvis style hair as we saw in the Mechanic from Series 6. This time it is cast in dark flesh, which looks excellent. It suits the character very well and looks great for displaying him with his helmet off.</div><div><br></div><div>His head is printed on both sides with a large ginger moustache and eyebrows. On one side he is grinning like a maniac, on the other he is looking very concerned, presumably because one his stunts has gone very wrong indeed. I am so glad they have included a double-sided head as it can make playing with the Minifigure more fun!</div><div><br></div><div>The white cape is a fairly rare piece and an extremely useful one. There are plenty of figures who could do with one and so it could be re-used on another Minifigure if you wish. The cape is the same shape as the standard Lego cape and fits in the same way as usual around the figure's neck.</div><div><br></div><div>His torso is printed with red and blue on a white background, continuing the&nbsp;colour scheme&nbsp;of the helmet. There is an open collar which shows a white vest of some kind underneath, lots of red highlights and patterns, as well as that star again which we saw on the helmet. There is a zip on the front of his jacket and blue printing at the sides of the torso to show padding. He even features red, white and blue wings on either side of the star which is very reminiscent of the designs on Evel Knievel's uniform! His arms are plain white with red gloves and there is no back printing.</div><div><br></div><div>There is belt printing on the hips of the figure which features a tiny silver buckle with a motorbike on it. The legs are also printed with more blue padding and blue and red knee pads which look great.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This Minifigure lacks anything to really make him stand out compared with other figures from Series 7, but is&nbsp;nevertheless&nbsp;a very good little figure and it is worth having, just not perhaps at the top of your wanted list. The playability of the figure is absolutely fantastic though, if you have a motorbike from any of the other sets this allows you to recreate stunts which could be a lot of fun. On display the Minifigure looks good too and I especially like him when he is holding his helmet in his hand and his hair is visible. I would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this, but more to people who will play wit it rather than display it. I like the figure, but without any unique moulds, I am going to award this Minifigure with...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

<p>The white cape ends up looking like crap because it is white and attracts all sorts of grime.</p>

<p>The torso and legs are completely useless for anything besides a daredevil.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-01T16:41:37.867Z","an OKAY FIGURE!","<p>The seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Daredevil. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and incudes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair piece which was introduced in the Series 6 Mechanic. It&#39;s caste in a dark orange colour here, which was new to the figure. I do really love the colouring of it being orange, as well as the moulding all over te top and the front, and even the back and sides. For some reason it&#39;s a fitting hair piece as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has another really great expression. I love the triumphant expression, with the raised eyebrow, as well as the dark orange moustache. His big smile is fantastic as well. Overall, it looks great. Something else I just love so much abut it, is that it has an alternate expression, which has a scared face. Again, a fitting face,&nbsp;and a fantastic print as well.</p>

<p>Next is that cape, which is just plain white with no printing. It looks good nonetheless, and it&#39;s a nice addition to the figure.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features a fantastic design. I love the red, white, and blue colour scheme, and I also&nbsp;love the star in the middle, the blue on the sides, the gold zipper; just all around, I love the printing. It&#39;s great how he has those red gloves as well.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which feature some more really great printing. I love the blue and gold belt design, as well as the blue knee&nbsp;guards. I also liken how that top piece is red and the two bottom pieces are white.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have the accessory, which is that helmet, and it can be swat out with the hair piece as well. I do like the helmet, with the translucent blue covering, and I also love the red star printing on top.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good concept, but it just isn&#39;t one of my favourites. Not a lot is really happening, but I do love the hair, as well as the printing on all his parts. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give him a 3. Thanks for reading!</p>
