Ahcincimo mo qui tia?","Occasionally, popular history goes beyond the myopic focus on Europe + Egypt + Japan, and I am very happy to see that LEGO has decided to take a step in that direction by including the Aztec Warrior as part of the seventh wave of Collectible Minifigs. I am a complete sucker for historical Minifigs of any kind, and I was not disappointed to pick this guy up.<div><br></div><div>This is not the first time that LEGO has tried its hand at a Meso-American Minifig; the great Achu (bless you) was first seen way back in 1999 on the Amazon Ancient Ruins (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=5986-1"">5986</a>), and although his precise associated culture is questionable, he does maintain the stereotypical iconography usually associated with the cultures of Central and South America. Aztec Warrior, then, represents a clear evolution of this theme - not only is he (slightly) more historically accurate, he has also eschewed the Crayola colour scheme in favour of a much more realistic and detailed design.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Of particular note is Aztec Warrior's helmet that bears the eagle motif, which is large and incredibly detailed, if not slightly back-heavy. The pearl-gold colour choice is perfect, matching his spear and shield, the latter of which also includes a highly-detailed printed pattern.</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifig himself is no slouch. The warrior has a grim painted face, and, in a bit of macabre LEGO humour, he has around his neck a shrunken Minifig head that he wears into battle. Gruesome stuff! In the late 90s, I remember the Pirates featuring a set of conquistador-type Minifigs - they'd better be running in terror when they see this guy.</div><div><br></div><div>On the subject of pirates (and of historical Minifigs in general), here's a couple of designs I would really love to see in future iterations of the Collectible Minifig line:</div><div><br></div><div><ul><li>LEGO has done generic ""<a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Pirates&amp;subtheme=Islanders"">Islanders</a>"" before - how about a Polynesian Minifig? A Maori warrior would make for a great design, if perhaps a slightly obscure one.
</li><li>I am still holding my breath for a Chinese Minifig. If there is one civilisation that has no shortage of inspirations for beautiful costumes and characters, it's China.
</li><li>A Middle Eastern Minifig please? I would love to see an Arab or Ottoman Minifig.
</li><li>An African Minifig, possibly representing Ethiopia or perhaps the Zulu. And don't tell me that LEGO won't do ""coloured"" Collectible Minifigs because&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8804-12"">Werewolf</a>&nbsp;looks brown enough to me.&nbsp;
</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>But I suppose I got completely derailed. Just trust me on this one: if you like historical Minifigs, you'll love the Aztec Warrior. Go out and find him.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T19:45:49.32Z","An Ancient Culture is Represented at Last","<p>Set #8831 Aztec Warrior: A great Mini-Figure and great for troop building, an army of them are quite easy to be found thanks to the unique headdress/helmet piece that makes him one of the easiest of the ancient soldiers of history to be found. (And boy am I grateful about that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aztec Warrior includes some unique pieces, and some we've seen in other forms with different designs for different warriors. The spear for example is the same piece first introduced with the Roman Soldier from Series 1, here it is in a light golden hued plastic, part of me thinks it looks fine this way, while another part of me kind of wishes the blade was painted like the Tribal Chief's spear was to indicate which part is dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The round shield piece has a bird design on it, you can see the tail, two wings, a large feathery body and a head with a beak, and of course the talons. It is a very ancient looking design detail wise and I'm thrilled to see it as it renders this Mini-Figure quite authentic, or as authentic and historically accurate as LEGO Mini-Figures can ever be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print on the legs and torso are strongly indicative of the Aztec's culture, with short cut cloth pants, or maybe a different style of loincloth/shorts, and a nice green sash breaking up the maroon hue. The Aztec's were said to have a city of gold somewhere, if memery serves, and there is golden painted details for gold fabric as part of his clothing. Except for the printed neck band of the headdress, or some sort of collar piece, I'm not too sure what it's supposed to ultimately be with the feathered design I'd have to say it's more of a necklace really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, that is the only article of clothing on the upper body, it covers up the bare chest though, so all you can see is some toned abdomen muscles, he is a warrior after all. His face has a green paint design over the eyes, some tribal markings most likely, and his mouth is a thin serious looking line of determination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the headdress, this is a great new piece by LEGO, with rich details, an open bird's mouth allows the face to be seen while the large back piece is designed as the bird's wings, complete with black tipped feathers. Some sort of blue jewel or tassle is painted on the side and the eyes are also painted blue to match. It's a little hard to see what LEGO could do to re-use such a unique piece though, perhaps as some sort of Mardi Gras attendant or costume?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this Mini-Figure is a brilliant looking and well detailed piece that you can't do without, and I strongly reccomend him. I will admit though that he might not be for everybody, with such a unique design he might be a bit tricky to fit into MOCs or displays, still, even if you can't think of a good use for him he is a can't miss Mini-Fig.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"CapnRex101","2012-06-12T10:38:56.29Z","8831 (2) - Aztec Warrior","<p>The Aztec Warrior is one of my favourite Minifigures of Series 7, no doubt about it. He includes one brand new piece and lots of detail all over the figure which makes him ideal for display. There are plenty of pearl gold components that come with this Minifigure which are all very striking and are quite realistic given the&nbsp;early&nbsp;paintings and accounts of how these Aztec Warriors looked and what they wore. Not only does the figure look excellent, but this also has a lot of playability as it can be put into battle with loads of the wonderful Minifigures from previous series.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As always I will start at the top with the wonderful new mould of the Warrior's elaborate helmet. It is an incredible mould which is cast in pearl gold, I struggle to imagine how fantastic it would have looked in chrome gold, but it is great as it is so I am happy with what we have got. The piece is extremely large, about an inch tall! It has feathers moulded into the component which is lovely as well as two eyes, a large beak, some scroll work, and two small wings which form shoulder armour. The helmet is printed with all sorts of details such as a small amount of black printing on each feather, some blue eyes and two light blue circles with some black patterning within each circle. The feathered plumes split into two rows as you move down the back of the helmet which is nice. The entire piece slides nicely over the head of the Minifigure and his face lines up perfectly so it can be seen through the hole in the helmet which is between the top and bottom halves of the beak. Overall, an incredible part!</p><p>The face is fairly detailed as well, it features black eyebrows and a serious expression, but by far the most prominent feature on the face is the large area of green face paint which looks suitably tribal and primitive for an Aztec.</p><p>The torso piece has got a huge amount of detail on it. It features a large golden collar with lots of separate panels and some green stones&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;into it as well as a few feathers and, best of all, a tiny golden Minifigure head which is a lovely little detail to be added in my opinion. He has a green belt which looks like it is made of some kind of cloth due to the creases and folds printed on it.&nbsp;Beneath&nbsp;his collar and belt he has a bare chest and some of his muscles are visible. His back is left unprinted and his arms and hands are plain yellow with no printing either.</p><p>His hips and legs are both printed. His hips are mostly dark red but have a small area of dark green printed where some of the cloth belt is continued from the torso. When you get onto the legs the belt is continued some more until it gives way to red and gold stripes. He is wearing a loincloth on his legs which is mostly dark red but has a gold stripe with some elaborate Aztec patterns on it.</p><p>The Aztec&nbsp;Warrior&nbsp;carries two accessories, a golden spear and a nicely printed shield. The spear is the same mould as the one which first came with the Spartan way back in Series 2 of the Collectable Minifigures and here it is completely pearl gold with no printing at all. If you are looking to build up a collection of gold parts for a MOC involving treasure, then this Minifigure is a great way to get three really nice gold pieces to use.</p><p>The shield is cast in pearl gold and is the same piece we also saw come with the Spartan in Series 2 like the spear, this time it is printed on the front with some dark red areas which produces a nice bird motif. It looks&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;and continues the bird theme started by the helmet so they match up nicely. There is a stud in the centre of the shield so it is possible to attach things to it if you wish and a handle at the back to clip into a Minifigure's hand.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is figure which you should&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;purchase if you can in my opinion. There are lots of nice pieces including the wonderful helmet, which while it may not be all that useful for other Minifigures, it still looks great on here which makes up for that. There are no problems which I can find with this Minifigure and so I am of course going to award with a score of...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"tkettle9719","2012-05-22T22:43:37.38Z","Apocolypto: Lego Edition","<p>Behold, Greatness has come in your way if you have obtained this magnificent little minifigure. If not, then you have come to the right introduction and judgement. When I got this at the Dallas Comic-Con, I could not have been more thrilled by this genius little fig. It is so customized, and it is just a perfect little jewel to any collection.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Observe the beautiful face-paint if you will. It's applied with so much care and just because it looks cool, it makes you cry in joy.&nbsp;</li><li>-This little helmet is just too cool. It's rather big, but you'll make no mistake of its Mayan-ness.&nbsp;</li><li>-There's also a lot of detail in the torso and feet part. It looks rather awesome, and once again detail is omnipresent.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The shield is an awesome piece, but I don't feel like it should be here. Mayans may have carried spears and shields simultaneously, but I wouldn't have.&nbsp;</li><li>-To my dismay, there's no back printing. It seems that this entire series is lacking it, and it makes me saddened.&nbsp;</li><li>-The spear is an excellent piece, don't get me wrong, but the rubbery top is not my favorite component in the world.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This minifigure is just so excellent in overall front appeareance that I'm humbled before its presence. However, minor details can't bring this fig down. It's just too excellently made and so rare, so unique, that I can really say that I am ecstatic about this. Happy hunting, because this is a star!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"sideswinger","2021-04-24T16:14:54.08Z","looks GREAT, but IDK...","<p>The second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Aztec Warrior. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a close look!</p>

<p>On top is that mask piece, and oh my gosh, I am completely in love with the design of it. I mean not only is it fantastic for 2012, but it really is fantastic nowadays as well. So I&#39;m gonna break down all the detail on it for the review, as I actually have this figure in my collection. Back in the day my brother received two series 7 packs, and he got two of this figure, so I do have the figure. But anyway, I wanna start by talking about all the moulding, then we&#39;re gonna discuss the printing. Starting from the top, I love all the elaborate feather moulding, and how it goes in different directions from the base of the mask. The intricate individual feathers all look amazing, and I love how it curves downward as well. The moulding for the beak on the front looks splendid, as does the moulding around the eyes, and overall the moulding on it is simply phenomenal, and might be the most detailed piece of the series. But that&#39;s not all, as the mask has some fantastic printing as well, from all the black printing on every tip of every feather, and the blue Aztec circles on the sides also look great. Of course, he also has those bright blue eyes, and it all comes together for a fantastic looking piece. And as an extra bonus, the colour it&#39;s caste in, being pearl gold, is awesome looking as well. Overall, that piece is so amazing, and I am very impressed, especially considering this was 2012.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has some really nice printing on it. I love the green face, as well as his almost angry expression. He has no alternate face, which is fine.</p>

<p>Next is his torso printing, which I love so much. The golden necklace has lots of details, with the white and black feathers and even that tiny minifigure head, which is such a great touch. He has some yellow muscles under that, and the green waistband looks really fantastic as well. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the figure already has some crazy detail, but he has no back torso printing, which looks a little bad from the front. I suppose it could be overlooked though, since the front of his torso has such great printing.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, which have even more amazing printing. I really love how the green waistband carries on to the red pants, and the gold and green circle design on front really adds to the figures overall design. So not only does the front have great printing, the sides have some really nice jagged red printing that matches the jagged red pants on front.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his two accessories, both of which look really fantastic. Both of them are done in pearl gold, and the first one is that shield. I love the stud in the centre, as well as the rim surrounding it. But the printing on the front of it looks really fantastic, with all the historic characters and such. I like how it continues the dark red and pearl gold colour scheme as well. His spear is equally great, with the entire thing being pearl gold. Of course the tip of that spear piece is rubber and the handle is plastic, and they both come together for a great weapon.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, the historical CMF&#39;s are normally my least favourites in the series. However, I love this figure. The mask is outstanding, and the torso, legs, and accessories are great. However, with that being said, this isn&#39;t one of my favourites of the series just because the concept isn&#39;t the most amazing. It&#39;s basically just a historic warrior, which is a concept we&#39;ve gotten several times in the&nbsp;span of Series 1 to 7. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is far from being one of my least favourites, but it isn&#39;t exactly one og my favourites either. I am gonna give him a 4 because the figure itself looks fantastic, I just think the concept is slightly boring. But that is all for this review! Thanks for Reading me ramble on, and thank you&nbsp;for reading this very long review!</p>
