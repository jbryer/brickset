"CapnRex101","2012-06-06T18:08:31.92Z","8831 (12) - Computer Programmer","<p>The Computer Programmer is a lovely character to base a figure on and I am certainly glad we now have it, therefore when I first heard the line up for Series 7, this was one of the figures I wanted most of all. When pictures became available, I knew Lego was on to a winner and I am certainly very pleased with the eventual result. A superb figure, but what about it is so good? Read on and see...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start with the nice hair piece. It is fairly uncommon at the time of writing as it appears in only two&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;sets in this colour. The part was first seen in the Star Wars line where it was used for Obi-Wan Kenobi and it suited him very well indeed, for both his Clone Wars and Movie appearances. It suits this figure just as well in black, very neat and tidy, just as you would expect of a professional computer programmer.</p><p>The head printing is on only one side but is great nonetheless. He has a slight smirk, black eyebrows which match his hair colour unlike some other Minifigures and a pair of wide rimmed spectacles with a small white bridge section which adds a bit of nice extra detail.</p><p>His torso is printed with a tan sleeveless tank top with a wide neck and some stitched patterns on his chest which is very much like some jumpers I have seen in shops. You can see a light blue shirt and dark blue bow tie through the open collar area and he has light blue arms which demonstrate how his jumper is sleeveless. His hands are plain yellow and there is no back printing.</p><p>His legs are brown with no printing which is perfectly satisfactory for such a character and quite suited to him in fact.&nbsp;</p><p>He carries two accessories, the first of which is a dark grey laptop. This is the first time it has appeared in dark grey as it usually comes in black. It is not a common mould and it is good to see it available cheaply now with a Collectable Minifigure. I like the piece and it can of course be opened to see the screen (which is blank but you can use your imagination) and closed so it can be held in the figure's hand.</p><p>The last piece is the fantastic printed mug. It is my favourite component of the figure and is absolutely outstanding. It is cast in white and has some printing on it of various computer symbols, they are (:\ and I have no idea what they mean or if they have any meaning at all, but they are still a nice touch and certainly massively contribute to the character of the Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a figure which really is a must have and for such a low price, there is really no excuse not to get it! He is a great little figure with plenty of detail and some&nbsp;potential&nbsp;for playability, if you have ever made an office MOC, it is not truly complete without one of these guys wandering around after all. The cup alone is worth the price and if you need laptops or want more of this lovely black hair piece, this is the place to get them. The torso too is desirable as it would fit on just about any male figure, be they old or young, for your own custom creations.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

This figure comes a lap top piece which is rather neat and as well as not appearing in many sets for a while in this model is the cheapest way to get hold of it too. He also comes with a mug which has some nice detailing on the side resembling key pad emotions. The figure himself comes with a styled black hair piece and a head showing off an intellectual style face with glasses and a neutral smile while his chest has a shirt and tie printed on with a few other printings too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall as simple and plain as he looks he is a must and is certain among the higher ranks of series seven. as well as those collecting series seven I also recommend him to those who like towns and those who like computer figures as well.

"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T17:05:52.867Z","Program Code 1101001110","<p>Set #8831 Computer Programmer: Series 7 of the Collectible Mini-Figures is introducing a fair number of interesting new choices, among them is this brilliant little Mini-Fig, the Computer Programmer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first got this guy I wasn't that impressed, but after looking at his design and his overall appearance I have to say he really is one of those rare finds, a Mini-Figure that adds something new and impressive to any MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The facial print on this guy is the very epitome of socially awkward nerd, he's got big bushy eyebrows, a wire-rim pair of glasses that are perhaps slightly bigger than is functional and a nervous looking half-smile. The black hair piece is a nice one too evocative of a bowl cut hair style. Conservative all around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's wearing a sweater vest, which unfortunately is only a one-sided print, I think he may have benefited from the cost of giving him a double-sided torso print, he's got on a blue bow-tie and a blue undershirt, the sleeves of which are clearly visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, he includes two fun little accessories that are a must have for any MOCer. You've got the Leet Speak smily print coffee mug, every computer programmer should have one of those, and a small gray laptop, a great new LEGO piece that has been long overdue in this fan's opinion. Every LEGO City needs state of the art computer software, not those old clunky sticker-on-a-brick computers of the 1990s, but brand new molded parts with keyboards and screens. (I am however a bit concerned that, much like the LEGO Book pieces introduced with Harry Potter, the piece if opened and closed excessively could snap in half.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is a must have Mini-Figure from Series 7. If you haven't managed to get this one yet, try to, and if you have one, go for more. He's got some great parts for MOCing, and every LEGO City needs some decent programmers to help run the infrastructure. (Or sit around pretending to be a Tech Support, while sipping coffee and laughing at the computer illiterate.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-05-03T15:32:32.15Z","a GREAT FIGURE!","<p>The twelfth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Computer Programmer. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So staring off this figure, we have that smooth black hair piece, which was fairly uncommon back then. It wasn&#39;t new for the figure, but it fits so extremely well that I love seeing it here. I like how smooth it is, with little moulded detail, and I like the choice of casting it in black.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which features a fantastic expression. It looks a bit...well let&#39;s be honest; it looks pretty nerdy, which is pretty fantastic! I love the broken glasses with the tape in the middle. I also love the crooked smile. Aside from having a great look, it&#39;s pretty useful outside the setting as well. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features some fantastic printing! I just love that sweater vest design. For starters, I like the diamonds in the centre with the white &quot;X&quot;s on them. The collar design looks superb, with the dark green bow-tie, and I like how there&#39;s some detail on the underdshirt there, as well as the detail around the collar. I also love how the arms are caste in that light blue colour, and they&#39;re pretty useful as well. He has no back printing, but I like how the torso is caste in the colour of the vest, as it gives the appearance that the vest covers the entire torso.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which feature no printed detail. I do love the choice of casting them in reddish-brown, as it does fit the nerdy aesthetic&nbsp;of the figure.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessories, two of which are included. The first one to discuss is that coffee cup, which has that very great printing on the front. I also like how the cup is white and the characters are black. His second accessory is that computer, which shockingly enough, was not new for the figure. Seeing it in that colour, however, was new indeed, being dark grey. I just love that piece, and how it can close u to be held, and opened up to display some excellent moulded detail on the keyboard, and even an indented screen. And of course, both accessories fit the figure expertly.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, I love this figure very much. The concept of having a typical...well...nerd in a CMF series blows my mind, and I think it&#39;s executed amazingly. I love all the pieces included, and I think this is one&nbsp;of my favourites in the series! So thanks for reading!</p>
