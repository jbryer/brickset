"CapnRex101","2012-04-05T16:51:07.63Z","8831 (4) - Bride","<p>It seems like very little time since the&nbsp;release&nbsp;of the last series of Collectable Minifigures, but here we go again, Series 7 has been released and it is time to review them all again! The first of these I am going to review is the Bride, a decent Minifigure, not the best of the collection, but a great addition&nbsp;nevertheless. The look of the figure is spot on and it includes three brand new pieces (including the fabric cape/veil)!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The new parts are all superb, but I will run down all of them from top to bottom. We start at the nice tiara which is new in this colour, but has been seen before in gold, mostly in Castle sets. I like the piece but it is of limited use as it can only be used with certain kinds of hair with a small hole for the peg on the tiara to fit into, however, it really adds something to this Minifigure.</p><p>The cape is new as well, slightly longer than your standard Lego cape but made in the same way and of a similar material with two small holes which fold together to create the shape. It is made of a slightly softer material than usual and it is difficult to place around the neck of a figure as it is too long, but it could be trimmed to size if you are prepared to do that, after all, in the past white capes have been highly sought after and fairly hard to come by.</p><p>The hair is also a brand new mould although from the front it looks like the same hair as the Nurse from Series 1 had! It is suitably beautiful for a bride with plenty of detail and kind of bun at the back where there is a hole for the tiara. This hole is not as big a flaw as you might think because if you want to use the hair without the extra adornment the hole all but disappears in the dark brown colour. One of my favourite female hair pieces for a long time!</p><p>The head is printed with a huge grin, just as one would see on the big day in reality (we hope)! It also shows eyelashes and brown eyebrows so it is certainly reusable on other female Minifigures despite the oversized smile.</p><p>The torso is also lovely with loads of detail and a fair bit of chrome printing. The top of the torso is printed yellow as it shows bare skin, but when the dress starts it looks great, all white and silver with crease lines to add a bit of extra sparkle. The tiny curls and spots on the dress are perfectly printed and look great in a very shiny silver. The arms are plain yellow which suits the figure perfectly.</p><p>A slope piece creates the bottom of the dress, just like most other female figures in this most fantastic theme have had. This one is printed a little bit at the top and bottom with more silver swirls and creases.</p><p>Finally, the bouquet of flowers is also brand new, while it is similar to the older plant stem part it now can be easily held in the Minifigures grip rather than placed on top of the hand like the older pieces. Three pink flower pieces are placed on the stem in the same way as the older plant stem parts&nbsp;although&nbsp;four are included in the packet on a sprue.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I really do like this Minifigure as it totally creates the look of the character and is also fairly playable, especially if you have the new Town Hall set (10224) where she can get married, or you could even make your own church! Now I have a fun fact for you, did you know that this Minifigure contains the most parts of any Minifigure released thus far in the Collectable Minifigures theme? An incredible twelve! Does that make it the best ever Minifigure? No, but it is still a great little figure with plenty of playability and potential for display. Despite this, the character just is not as exciting for me as something like the Roman Soldier from Series 6 which is why I cannot give it more than...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"cybiko","2012-04-26T20:47:33.41Z","Fine figure of a young woman.","This figure has some fantastic detail and new features.<br><br>Tiara: Now in metallic silver. Yay!<br><br>Veil: The veil is a totally different material than previous lego capes/skirts. It's soft and falls nicely against the figure. It has 2 small holes and is intended to be pinned in place by the tiara. It is the full height of the figure. Be careful when cutting open the package as the veil is hard to feel and is much longer than other elements.<br><br>Hair: Although the front looks similar to other female hairstyles it is swept back into an updo, a french twist/roll, with a small hole at the top for the tiara. This hole will also take any of the hair accessories from the Friends lines as well as flame/feather elements.<br><br>Flower stem: This is a new 3 prong flower stem that can be held in the minifig hand (or placed into a 1x1 cone piece) rather than poistioned over the hand. The 3 stems branch out closer to the base and are shorter making the overall size a much better scale to be held as a bouquet.<br><br>Flowers: The sprue of 4 flowers is in pale pink which, although done before, hasn't been seen in a while.<br><br>Torso and Skirt: The printing is fantastic on the body elements. The bar of yellow across the top of the torso and yellow arms make the dress look sleeveless, if not strapless. Since the top, sides, and back of the torso are still white, it tends towards a sleeveless look. The dress details in silver makes it look like it's got lovely lacework along the top and bottom of the bodice as well as along the skirt bottom. The torso corset has boning and the skirt has some pleats to give the illusion of shape other than brick square.<br><br>Head: The face is printed on just 1 side. It has a wide smile, visible lashes, brown eyebrows, all of which are neutral enough to reuse the piece elsewhere.<br><br>With 3 to a box it's a less common minifig in the series. I don't know how much in demand a bride figure will be. The skirt makes it easier to detect in the packs. It's easy enough to find the tiara, flower elements, or hair that distinguish it from the other skirt packaged in the series.<br><br>The bride is a lovely addition to the minifigure series with lots of attention to detail as well as elements that could be easily utilized elsewhere.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Firox_5000","2012-07-22T17:54:20.233Z","Here comes the bride ","This is one of the many series 7 mini figures that I own which is a rather nice figure of a bride. The figure takes around 30 seconds to build and compared to most takes longer and contains the highest amount of pieces in this series.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The figure comes with a dress sloped piece and a dress which is also printed on the chest as well which is a very nice touch to the figure resembling a dress. The figure also comes with some flowers which have three pink pieces connected. She also wears a bob length hair piece which has a hole which can connect the veil which is like a long cloak but does the job as well as new tiara silver coloured piece which holds the veil in place. She also has &nbsp;a smiling face on the head which has big red lips.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall clearly not the best but not the worst in the series and is one I'd recommend if you don't have a decent bride mini figure yet and is one I'd recommend as well to any one collecting series 7.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-07-24T19:22:09.12Z","March Down the Aisle","<p>Set #8831 Bride: A unique and rare Mini-Figure from LEGO, the Bride is a nice looking addition for any MOC wedding scene, and introduces a whole new level of detail to any display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's really quite a treat to behold, decked all in white with a special wedding dress print on her torso and lower sloped brick, for the legs, this Mini-Figure has an amazing level of detail. The dress looks gorgeous, it has a great silver toned lace around the waist and just above the bust, this pattern is also used for the trim. Her face is suitable for a blushing bride, with a happy, radiant smile, ruby red lips, eyebrows and eyelashes that match the hair color. A rich dark brown, the hair piece is also unique, with the hair done up in a sort of short bun, and a small hole is used to hold the veil and tiara in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tiara itself is a silver toned plastic with five points, and five small round molded details that could be jewelry, a shame they weren't painted a different color from the base color, but MOCers can certainly repaint them to sparkle and shine like jewels if they so chose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She includes a bouquet of pink flowers, with an extra blossom to use on any other three-stem plants you may have lieing around bare. Overall, I'd have to say that the Bride is a must own and very much appreciated Mini-Figure to add to any collection and all I have to say at this point to LEGO is, bring on the Groom. Maybe a few Bridesmaids using the same hair piece only with different sized tiaras and things, and perhaps a priest to bless the happy couple. (Or a Rabai, or any other Religious Figurehead that would be acceptable for LEGO to produce.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-25T00:51:03.237Z","not one of the BEST...","<p>The fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Bride. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 11 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that crown, veil, and hair. I suppose we can start with the hair, which I believe was new for the figure. I love how smooth and pretty that piece is, and it&#39;s caste in dark brown here. I like the moulding on the front of it, and it has that little hole on top to plug in the crown and veil. The crown is slightly odd for a bride, but it looks good nonetheless in that shiny silver. I like the 5 round tips as well. However, I&#39;m just not too sure about that veil. I mean I love the inclusion of a veil, but it just doesn&#39;t look right, being too thick, and being the wrong material. Still, I suppose it&#39;s decent.</p>

<p>Next is her face, and I really love the printing on it. I love how happy her smile is, and I love her thin eyebrows&nbsp;too. She has no back face printing, which is okay.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and the printing on it is pretty great. I love the slender dress, as well as all the shiny, silver designs. I love how her yellow arms are exposed, and overall, it&#39;s a good torso design.</p>

<p>Next is her dress piece, and I really love the shiny silver printing it has on it. I love how the silver carries on from the torso to the top of her dress pretty seamlessly, and the detail on the bottom of it is great as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her flowers, which is made of two pieces: The green stem piece, and the pink flowers which are all one piece and can be snapped off separately to be applied to the top of the stem. It&#39;s a fitting accessory, and I like the choice of making the flowers pink.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I used to really love this figure, but I&#39;m sorry to say that my love of it has slightly waned. Not much, but a little. It still has some great parts, like the hair, the head, and the crown, and the printing on the torso and dress is okay as well, but I&#39;m just not that big of a fan. I think that might be because we&#39;ve gotten several bride figures outside of Series 7, so this just doesn&#39;t feel that unique. So in the end, I am gonna give her a 3 out of 5. But that&#39;s it for this review! Check out my profile if you&#39;re interested, and thanks for reading!</p>
