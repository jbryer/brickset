"Shistavanen_brick","2012-05-08T01:29:54.45Z","I see red!","According to his biography, the Evil Knight spent a summer at Lord Vladek's castle and was delighted that he got to keep his red eyes he got during, and after his stay. Also, he seems to like to pick a fight and has served under several different lords. He could pose as a problem maker to any good kingdom in the LEGO world. Maybe LEGO should think about giving us a Good Knight in a future collectable minifigures series, just to even the odds?<div><br></div><h4>Minifigure.</h4><div><br></div><div>The Evil Knight is a great one to have, even multiple knights make a small and good raiding army. I think this is one of my preferred minifigs from series 7. It comes with quite a few pieces and they are all very nicely done.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Head:</b>&nbsp;The knight has a very angry face, and of course red eyes. It has a lot of personality.</div><div><b>Torso/legs:</b>&nbsp;Nothing special about the torso, just plain black. The legs, however, has some nice armour printing in white.</div><div><b>Weapons/shield:&nbsp;</b>The sword you get is in the same style as the Highland Battler, although a bit darker grey in colour I think. Since this guy seems to come from a group that is fierce it's no wonder they chose a wild boar to represent them. That comes alive with this cool shield. As another reviewer pointed out, this shield is probably the same mold as the Elf shield from series 3. Smacked in the middle there's a wild boar head in red, surrounded by what looks like tusks or teeth.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Armour/helmet:</b> I am a big fan of printed LEGO medieval armour, this piece has the same cool boar tusk printing as the shield and the visible rivets gives it a slight tattered feel. Which of course suits the Evil Knight! The helmet has an ""evil"" design and does look similar to Vladek's in a way. I guess evil knights must have a special design to most of their gear in order to differ from the good guys.</div><div><br></div><div>I highly recommend you get this if you can. If you are a Castle/Medieval fan and have the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10223-1"">Kingdoms Joust</a>, it will be a nice addition to have yet another jousting knight to enter the prize tournament!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Cool minifigure with plenty of stuff, sword, armour etc.</li><li>Very usable if you are a Castle/Kingdoms fan.</li><li>Looks great displayed.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Can't really think of anything except for some lack of torso-printing.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,3

The playability of this figure is high and as well as series figures he also fits in well with many castle and medieval settings mostly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would recommend this figure to those who like castle and medieval collectors and all lego fans who collect figures as this dark evil knight makes a good addition to any ones collection.

"CapnRex101","2012-06-05T09:08:39.743Z","8831 (14) - Evil Knight","<p>The Evil Knight is a great figure with some of the best detailing of any of the Collectable Minifigures from this series or any of the others. The playability for this figure is second to none and it might be worth picking up a few of these guys to build an evil army of soldiers. The character could be of use in themes other than the&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures such as Kingdoms, which only increases its desirability for me.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Firstly, the figure wears a black helmet which has been seen before worn by skeletons and trolls in the Castle theme in 2007 and before that in Knight's Kingdom II. It suits this Minifigure very well and makes him look very evil and intimidating.</p><p>His face also contributes to his evil appearance, mainly thanks to the huge red eyes he has which look very menacing indeed. He has gigantic bushy black eyebrows and lots of lines on his face which convey his anger very effectively. His teeth are gritted as well which also makes him look in a kind of blood lust state like a Berserker from actual military history. His head is not double sided.</p><p>He&nbsp;also&nbsp;wears a black armour piece which is printed very nicely with plenty of chrome silver stud work and panelling which looks spectacular. It really contributes to the cruel appearance of the character and suits the figure very nicely indeed. There is no printing on the reverse side of this piece which is a shame, but it is forgiveable as nobody really looks at the back too much given the excellent front!</p><p>The torso is totally plain black with no printing at all. His arms and hands are black as well. This may seem odd, but it is of course totally obscured by the chest armour on the front and back which makes it fine.</p><p>His legs and hips are printed with more of the metallic banding and stud work. It is on his upper thighs, knees, and feet which even with the relatively small amount of printing, makes him look very detailed indeed. In the centre of his hips too there is a bit of printing which fills in the gap in his chest plate.</p><p>He carries two&nbsp;fantastic&nbsp;accessories, the&nbsp;first&nbsp;of which is his huge sword which also comes with the Highland Battler from Series 6 of the Collectable Minifigures and in the new Lord of the Rings sets. It looks great in this dark grey colour which fits nicely with the Evil Knight, suitably dark and menacing. I love this mould and hope we will see a lot more of it in the future.</p><p>Finally, his outstanding shield looks superb with lots more stud work like his armour plated chest and legs and metal panelling as well. In the centre of the tear drop shaped shield is a dark red boar's head which is quite intimidating with huge tusks and his tongue hanging out. The whole design is printed on a black piece to match the rest of his armoury.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In summary, this is a figure which I would highly recommend, it would have been nice to see a new armour component for his chest plate, however what we have been given looks good as well. The character is excellent and the design of the shield is just about as good as it gets! Due to the lack of a new mould for his armour, I am going to knock a point off however, leaving this figure with a score of...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"tvih","2012-06-10T16:23:02.863Z","Nice addition to Castle theme","<p>Being a Castle fan, this is the one figure I really wanted from Series 7.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Breastplate armor</li><li>Large shield with boar emblem (I like boars!)</li><li>Sword and helmet different from ""usual""</li><li>Unique, menacing look as a whole</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>If you only want this one like I did and don't buy an already opened bag, it may take a while to find the correct figure - but that's true for any figure in these sets</li><li>Unless you buy multiple ones, you can't really make a ""boar faction army"" :P</li><li>No printing on the shirt of the figure, but unless you don't want to use the breastplate on him for some reason, this is a non-issue</li></ul>
<p>Overall it's a very nice - err, I mean evil! - knight figure, and well worth getting for any Castle fan. Can't really think of anything really negative about the figure itself, my only problem was with finding it :)</p><p>P.S. On that note a tip to anyone looking for this specifically from an unopened bag - while many give the advice to look for the shield, don't. This was my error, and I ended up as far from getting a knight as possible! The shield is flat, and with the paper thingie as well as the figure base in the bag, it's really difficult to find let alone correctly identify the shield. I ended up identifying this figure because of the armor, which really is the easiest part to find. After all it's the thickest part, and I could clearly feel the middle line and leg guards of the armor through the bag. By comparison I specifically tried to find the shield, already knowing it was a knight, but couldn't find it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-04T22:58:06.837Z","why an EVIL knight???","<p>The fourteenth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 7 is the Evil Knight. He was released in 2012, retailed for three bucks, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that helmet, which is a good piece, though I don&#39;t quite believe it was new for the figure or anything. It&#39;s a very fitting helmet, and I love how it curves on the sides, as well as the pointy edges on the very sides. It looks great in black as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which looks pretty creepy, with those large, red eyes. I like his angry sneer, and I love how he has all those cheekbones and different little creases in his head. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>I guess the next thing to discuss would be that breastplate, which is a pretty great piece. I love how smooth it is on the fronts, and I also like how bulky it is. I love&nbsp;the pointy edges on the bottom, and all that good stuff. The printing on the front is excellent; I love all the man little silver dots, as well as the shiny silver detail around the top of his collar and all. It has some spikes on the bottom of it, too. The back of it is very interesting, where it appears to be rather smooth. It has no printing whatsoever on the back, but that&#39;s okay, as the front really does have some great detail. I love how it has spiky shoulder-pads as well that cover the arms.</p>

<p>Underneath that&nbsp;breastplate, and also the next piece going from top to bottom, is the torso. Everything about the torso, being the arms, hands, and torso itself is all just plain black. He doesn&#39;t need torso printing, so it can easily be excused, but printing on the torso would have been a great little touch. Oh well!</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which are sporting some pretty fine printing. I like all the silver details, with the spikes on his shoes. I also like the silver details on the top, and also the middle of the legs, and he even has a small belt on the upper section of the legs. All in all, I love all the many details on the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next is his accessories, two of which are included. The first one to discuss is that big sword, which is of course, a fantastic inclusion. I like the very dark grey colouring that the sword is caste in, and I also like the round hilt. And also, that shield is a fantastic inclusion, and I love how it looks. The piece itself is also great, with all the silver printing around the edges, and I like all the spikes around it as well. Of course, that red hog in the centre looks fantastic.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure! Overall, I do like the design of him, with all his greatly printed pieces, but I am a bit curious on why LEGO chose to make an &quot;Evil Knight&quot; before making a plain, normal knight. That&#39;s just really strange. I mean I can&#39;t really deny it: he looks okay. I just don&#39;t like the choice of having an Evil Knight before a normal knight. So I am going to be giving him a 3 out of 5. That wraps up this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
