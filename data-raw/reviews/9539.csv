<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good display piece</li><li>Lots of parts for an exclusive</li><li>Lots of tiny detail in the store</li><li>Roof comes off too see a Ceiling view of the store</li><li>Mini Pick-a-Brick wall and Cash register</li><li>Roof looks like top of a brick with the ceiling light being the bottom</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Exclusive (a given)</li><li>Simple build</li><li>Doors don't open</li><li>Not quite as big as the store I've seen (space inside looks cramed together, not enough floor space, should be more elongated to be accurate)</li><li></li></ul>
<p>It was a fun build that took 10 or so minutes but still a nice set. If you can go to any of the openings and get this I would recommend it and for free with a purchase of $35 or more it's basically a steal but it is only limited 300 per store so act fast at the opening you go to.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,1,5
