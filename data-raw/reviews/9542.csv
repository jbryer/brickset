<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Some fairly good parts (from the purple tile to the silver studs to the yellow 2X4 slopes to all of the black corner slopes)<br></li></ul><ul><li>Nice little area inside for storing something small, when you remove the hat. (This is my presumption that it is meant as a storage space)</li><li>
Instantly recognizable</li><li>Inexpensive (under 10 cents a piece)<br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>'Storage space' is very small, and if you put something inside you would see it through the eyes and mouth sections<br></li><li>The bottom of the Witches head is gray, and I'm not sure why.<br></li></ul>
<p>In total, I like it. It's not very playable, being a large witch head, but It's a nice little display set to put up on a shelf, and I like standing it up next to the 8684-4 witch, though they look very different.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
