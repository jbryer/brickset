"tisi","2013-03-29T18:00:31.34Z","Lovely turkey!","<p>I saw dozens of these small polybag sets in a local Lego Store, so I've picked up one. I'm almost 100% positive about it, but not at every points... Details below.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No box. Of course, because it's a small promotional set in polybag. The instruction booklet is small and folded.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>52 parts - not so few at all! And all of them are basic ones (bricks, slopes, plates), and those come in a big sort of colors, so those can be useful in the future.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special there, it takes only a few minutes.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed turkey looks absolutely great, better than on the picture (I've put him next to my monitor). The only play feature is his moveable wing, no more, so it's maybe a model instead of a toy. And it's realistic! Well, not as realistic as it could be (the head and the legs are too big), but nice.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This tricky bird costs too much, and there's no way to find it on sale, but it's a neat thanksgiving promotional at all. So I can recommend it!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2

<p>The Turkey is an elegantly simple design packed into a polybag, it features a decent amount of pieces mostly in brown and captures the likeness of the bird in brick form quite nicely. There really isn't much else to say about this, mind you the mileage you get on this set for the younger crowd will vary. Some may enjoy it more as the bird in question, others might think of it as merely a parts pack, however they choose to enjoy it you can't go wrong.</p>
<p>This Polybag is a much better seasonal one than some of the past ones we've seen out of LEGO, and while not exactly Mini-Figure scaled or even practical to say such a thing, it makes for an interesting display piece next to Mini-Figures as a roadside attraction perhaps. If you can get this for a good deal I recommend picking it up, if you're obsessed with Polybags you'll be after one for display and one to keep sealed. Anybody who does not fit in either category should probably just skip it, I mean it isn't a must own set by any stretch of the imagination. As evidenced by how many were left over after the TRU Bricktober weekly event, guess not enough people wanted to spend 30$ to get this for free.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
