So you have to replace them with two regular 1x2s but then you cannot attach the green wreath. Or use four 1x1 red headlight pieces, I don't know why they did not use those.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,2

And what a clever looking little festive Polybag.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The miniature train and tender looks spectacular, and work well with all of the past Holiday sets I've picked up over the years. Collecting Christmas LEGO is always fun and this train does not dissapoint as far as build or design goes. 
<li>The two buildable candy canes look quite nice, this does a good job of representing the treats in LEGO form. 
<li>It's just so festive, not much of a pro really, but I can't stop thinking of how cute this thing looks. It's especially nice when you put it alongside the Rocking Horse as two buildable toys to put under some kind of christmas tree LEGO display.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>It isn't very compatible with LEGO Train tracks, since it's using standard Car tire axles they are a bit too small for working on the track pieces LEGO makes. 
<li>Some may not like the open cab section for the engineer's design due to&nbsp;the fact that is a large open space.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I love collecting polybags, and LEGO's Christmas Polybags rarely dissapoint, be they Seasonal or Creator based they always stand out as some of the better designed Polybags. Especially compared to that Little Car some areas of the world got this year from LEGO Creator. I'd say it's worth tracking down if you can find one, recommended for this festive season and all the ones beyond.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
