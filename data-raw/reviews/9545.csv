<p>This is a Seasonal Set from 2012, it is a Christmas based set and is or was more than likely a LEGO Store exclusive that eventually found its way to TRU in Canada. (My first time seeing it was this past week, so left over stock must have been shipped out for the TRU promotion where if you spent a certain amount on LEGO Creator you would recieve this free.)</p>
<p>The design of the model is not Mini-Figure scale, it is however a very elegant looking design evoking that classic old world Rocking Horse you'd find in Christmas Specials on t-v or antique stores. It is brick built, the instructions are pretty good, easy to follow and as you move from step to step you slowly start to see the finished piece emerge.</p>
<p>You start with the horse and move on to the rockers once that is finished. Overall I'm pretty impressed with this design, ordinarily I buy Polybags that are strictly Mini-Figure compatible in nature, there are a few exceptions to this, and&nbsp;I find the Christams Seasonal Themes to be very enjoyable at this time of year to collect, build and display. As a polybag this is a set I heartily recommend, especially with the holidays right around the corner it'd make a great stocking stuffer. The price is a bit higher than typical Polybags, they were charging 6.99$ for it compared to your usual polybag price. However that isn't bad considering the size of the pieces in this one, they aren't your typical bunch of tiny pieces to build a miniature model, these are actual bricks and large plates. As I say, definitely recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3
