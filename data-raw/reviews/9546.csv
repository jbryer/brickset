<ul>
<li>Pro 1 Nice rare light teal pieces 
<li>Pro 2 Great as a background&nbsp;vehicle with the newer set in the foreground to give a sense of a combat formation. 
<li>Pro 3 Free 
<li>
<li>â€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1 Could of taken a better picture of the sopwith at a different angle for the package as the current one does not do justice when looking at the finish build.</li></ul>
<p>I recommend this set to anyone getting the updated version of the Sopwith Camel as it really looks neat as mention in Pro 2.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Techman","2012-06-16T21:02:39.707Z","A well thought out micro set","This set actually came into my possession from my order of lego set 8110 earlier. I can't say much about the price because this was given to me for free. The set came in a poly bag with a small instruction book. One bag was inside and the rest of the parts were separate. The build wasn't long and I have to say, I liked the new green tile pieces. I haven't owned them before today so it was cool pieces that lego introduced. Also, the new 2x4 tile in green and 1x3 tile in green are sweet. Right now the set is displayed on a shelf an looks great. I think this micro build is a smaller version of the new Sopwith camel 10226. I don't own the larger model, but this smaller version seems just fine. There isn't much play ability involved except for the rotor and wheels. Even still, this set is a nice touch to my collection and serves as a great display piece to show. It is a good eye catcher.",FALSE,4,3,3,2,2

"vikings","2020-05-24T05:50:06.63Z","Sopwith Camel","<p>I got this set with my purchase at a Lego store as a promotional set (A long time ago).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with a little&nbsp;larger than normal size instructions for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this set. The green color pieces where very nice to get as they aren&#39;t very common. The total piece count for the set is 65.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice set. The detail and look of the plane is very good. It looks to resemble the larger scale well (The green color is lighter than the color used in the larger model). The design for the double wings is a nice technique. The&nbsp;red, white, and blue colors add some nice color to the overall look of the model.&nbsp;I recommend this set as it is just a nice model to add to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
