This was an easy purchase for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;My girlfriend knows I love LEGO, so getting a heart made of LEGO from me, with a special note inside,&nbsp;will likely put a smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heart is built in two sections. The back of the heart includes a small space for a letter or a small gift. A&nbsp;ring, perhaps? ; ) The front of the heart attaches to the back, and swivels freely to reveal the compartment. The build was very quick, but surprisingly fun. It was neat seeing the heart coming together one brick at a time: first the back, then the front. It looks exactly as it should when completed. It could easily pass as a keepsake box...for a very&nbsp;small keepsake. The completed heart is about the perfect size to fit into an adult hand. One note, and probably the only ""flaw"" I could find with this great little polybag set,&nbsp;is that the lid of the heart is very free swinging. There is no way to latch it tight. However, this is really not an issue once the heart is standing up on a flat surface, as the lid stays perfectly shut (the flat surface will not allow the lid to swing one way or the other). Only when you are holding&nbsp;the heart&nbsp;might you notice the lid sliding open accidentally. </p>
<p>All in all, I think this is a great little value as a gift to just let someone special know you were thinking of them. For $5, it's a no-brainer. I think this thing would sell like crazy if they put it&nbsp;up front with the candy&nbsp;in the big department stores, bewteen now and Valentine's&nbsp;Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>Looks exactly like a small, heart-shaped keepsake box&nbsp;(because that's what it is!)</p>
<p>A unique gift, sure to be appreciated because you took the time to build it by hand. </p>
<p>Fun, quick build.</p>
<p>Cheap enough to give to just&nbsp;randomly brighten someone's day. </p>
<p>You can stand it up straight or lay it down flat. It's pretty either way (especially standing up).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>The lid is a little loose, but stays firmly shut once standing up on flat surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recommended! </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
