<p>
 Actually it&#39;s still freezing in the UK at the moment, but LEGO brand stores have put this set, &#39;Springtime scene&#39;,&nbsp;out on the shelves to remind us that, hopefully, warmer weather is just around the corner.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=40052-1"" title=""View set details"">40052</a> is the latest in the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/search/?query=40000-40100"">40000 series</a>&nbsp;of sets that are&nbsp;normally exclusively sold in LEGO brand stores and shop.LEGO.com. They are usually seasonally themed, designed for specific shops (e.g. in New York), or for special in-store offers.</p>
<p>
 This one is unusual in that it&#39;s&nbsp;the first seasonal one&nbsp;to contain minifigs.</p>

<p>
 For a polybag set, it has a lot of pieces, 88 of them, including quite a few substantial ones. Consequently&nbsp;it commands a higher price than you&#39;d perhaps expect for a polybag: &pound;6.99.</p>
<p>
 As you can see from the photo above, it consists of three sub-models: a bench, a fountain and a tree. It contains 18 (plus 2 spares) of the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4624184"">&#39;Bracelet upper part&#39; </a>(1 x 1 flowery-piece) which is used on the flower stems and on the tree. The tree also has cherries hanging from it, which I believe&nbsp;is the first time I&#39;ve seen that in an official model.</p>
<p>
 As I&#39;ve said before, and will now demonstrate, the 1 x 1 flowery piece&nbsp;is for&nbsp;connecting certain pieces stud-to-stud:</p>

<p>
 The minifigs feature some of the more useful and attractive&nbsp;generic torsos that have been made over the last few years but, really, would the woman be wearing an all-orange trouser-suit? I think she&#39;d have looked better in jeans.</p>

<p>
 My only criticism of the set is that it would have been preferable to have had a larger base plate, say a 16 x 16,&nbsp;and for everything to fit on it rather than being three separate parts.</p>
<p>
 In summary, this is a neat little set, but its relatively high&nbsp;price probably pushes it above the impulse buy threshold for the casual buyer, particularly when there are much cooler sets (Kai&#39;s Power Mech for example) to be had for about the same amount of money.</p>
<p>
 It&#39;s definitely one that true&nbsp;LEGO aficionados will appreciate though. With <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=40054-1"" title=""View set details"">40054</a> Summer Scene and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=40057-1"" title=""View set details"">40057</a> Fall Scene sets due out later this year, together they&#39;ll all make a neat display.</p>
