It has some normal Baby bricks and two printed bricks - one printed with a Firetruck toy on it and another one is my favorite - a yellow brick printed with the Lego logo on two sides. A nice way to show your love of Lego is to take your baby brother's Lego logo printed piece and claim it yours. The set also has two figures - a Baby Mickey and a Baby Minnie.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
