<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good figure</li><li>Comes w/umbrella, beach chair, little flag, bucket, crab (so nice parts)</li><li>Cheap price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not much playability</li><li>Sandcastle does not look like a sandcastle</li><li>Other parts are mainly boring</li></ul><div>So overall, not big of a deal, but if you live by the beach, this would be a nice little set to have for its excellent price.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
