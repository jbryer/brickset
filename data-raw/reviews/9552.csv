(2014) Is it a worthy addition to your seasonal display? Read on and find out.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions simple and easy to follow.</p>

	<p>Halloween Pumpkin build is solid, sturdy and hollow. Inclusion of a light up brick feature would have been nice, you&rsquo;ll have to MOC your own though as LEGO has not included this feature.</p>

</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I am really glad this was offered again as a Bricktober giveaway, I missed out on it and the free Witch Head from last year and I really think this is a much better build and iconic seasonal set compared to the witch head. Being able to MOC it into a light up jack-o-lantern would have been nice straight out of the package, however I understand why LEGO hasn&rsquo;t integrated that function into something meant to be a simple build and cheap enough for an impulse buy. 10$ however is a high price to ask for this, even if there are slightly more pieces in it compared to standard polybags.</p>

<p>I recommend this one though, and judging by the TRU in my area it isn&rsquo;t too hard to come by even now. Odd choice for stocking stuffer, but honestly this is a really clever and fun build. Definitely a great offering from LEGO seasonal polybags.</p>
