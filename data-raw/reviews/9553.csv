"wildbearbricks","2014-11-02T07:16:48.223Z","A Polybag Feast!","<p>I love seasonal sets. They&#39;re&nbsp;so fun to pull out each year and have something to put together to display, and because it is only once a year it feels new in a way. This was my first time diving into the Thanksgiving Feast polybag, originally released in 2013. I purchased this set on eBay along with the &quot;Fall Scene&quot; seasonal polybag&nbsp;for $20 USD, so at $10 each, that&#39;s a pretty good aftermarket price!</p>

<p>This is what makes this little bag so great. The collection of parts is tremendous! First of all you get two 6x6 tan plates, great for vignettes or creating a good base. Bonus time, you get different colored cats!&nbsp;It&#39;s a great set to add food items to your personal inventory as well. You get a full turkey, a pie, a carrot, 3 sausages (yes 3, only two are pictured on the bag, but you get 3, they picture 3 in the instructions and 3 are on the parts list), and a loaf of bread. You also get some great kitchen parts, like a pot, 2 clear mugs, a gold platter, a translucent black&nbsp;bottle, and a clear bottle. And I almost completely missed this, but it&#39;s not a standard clear bottle!&nbsp;It has a custom print on it! It&#39;s a ship in the bottle! The print is sideways along the length of the bottle, so in the pic below you see it upright. Embarrassingly enough it took me awhile to figure out what this was. And I seriously almost completely missed it, I just expected a regular clear bottle, never expected to see this. Talk about a custom printed piece! And to find it in a polybag, pretty cool!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c297/jwilbur/Lego%2040056%20Thanksgiving%20Feast/IMG_0471.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two mini&nbsp;figures included, and though they seem simple at first glance, both are great for their own reason. The torso on the&nbsp;woman mini fig is one I haven&#39;t seen very much, it&#39;s festive, and a cool design in classic red and white colors which makes it versatile in other scenes should you want to take her elsewhere in your Lego world. The guy&#39;s green sweater and red pants seem pretty lame, and they are, but his head print is great! That&#39;s definitely one you could take and use elsewhere, a real man&#39;s face with all that stubble, and a half smile which is appropriate for the holidays (to some). :-) I also think the hair pieces included are well matched and both great inclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is the weakest part of the whole experience, as it is over so fast. You basically just build the table, which is cool, but it isn&#39;t much. And you put the keg together, which is just a few pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

A great display model during the Thanksgiving holiday, and contains a lot of usable elements during other times of the year. I understand the scale issue of using 2x2 round flat tiles for the plates, when the platter seems more like an actual plate. I would have liked to see white platters used for the plates so you could actually set food items inside the plates, as none of the food items lock into place. Everything, including the turkey, just sits there, so they can move around easily, whether you want them to or not. Difficult to balance food on the round tiles. I would have also liked the inclusion of a couple of simple chairs so the mini figs could sit down and enjoy their meal. Would have only added a few pieces and would have added a great deal to the overall scene and especially the playability factor.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Such a sweet set, portraying an obvious childless couple, having prepared&nbsp;a feast for themselves and their kitties (though no cat food, perhaps they plan to eat from the table). The parts are well worth the price, even if you have to pay aftermarket prices for it now. And I&#39;m blown away by that ship print on the clear bottle! Never saw that coming, what a great bonus! The many food and kitchenware items are fantastic. And this wholesome couple even thought to bring a keg to their 2 person Thanksgiving Feast. This is more how I picture the day going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The husband tapping that keg, the wife skipping the glass and drawing straight from whatever&#39;s in that ship bottle, and the cats diving straight into the sausage and turkey while their humans remain distracted for the evening. Happy Thanksgiving!&nbsp;</p>
