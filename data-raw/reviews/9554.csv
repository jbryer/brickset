It has 72 pieces and retails for $7.99. And really, that's the key: at $7.99, I see no reason to not get this set. It has neat mushroom pieces, fall colored ""leaves,"" and a nice 3 minifigure family. </p>
<p>I had fully intended to build this then place the various pieces in my LEGO city.&nbsp;To my surprise, however, this is a pretty convincing little scene all on its own, despite its small price and piece count. It is certainly a neat fall display. It will still likely end up incorporated into my town, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it looks all on its own. There's not a ton to say about this set, so I will conclude with some pros and cons to consider if this is a good value for you, either as a stand alone scene or as part of your LEGO town.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 minifigures in an $8 set? Yes, please. 
</li><li>wheelbarrow included 
</li><li>Love the 3 mushrooms 
</li><li>The trees look nice, considering their size 
</li><li>Lots of extra ""leaf"" pieces to throw about 
</li><li>The scene as a whole looks better than I expected 
</li><li>Simply a fantastic value for $7.99</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's such a nice looking scene, that I now want a full sized fall set. 
</li><li>Too bad some of the neatest polybags are not sold in places where the average person will see them....</li></ul>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Overall:</em></strong> This set is lovely for the money. Highly recommended<strong>.</strong> </p>

"United_Bricks","2013-12-07T19:46:48.263Z","A realistic Autumn scene. ","It's the time of year when the days get darker and colder and the trees shed their skins. I know myself leaves are everywhere this time of year and so cleaning them up is needed. Set 40057 is a Lego Exclusive found both online and at their official stores, at Â£6.99 this may seem steep compared to some other polybags but It's worth it.<div>I built this not long ago and was overall pleased with the end result, I admire the way Lego has included piece's that are meant to be leaves and they do you look like leaves. The figures are simple, 1 Man, 1 Woman and 1 Girl. The set is a nice addition to any Lego city or collection and fits in well with my Winter village sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am overall pleased with this set and would defiantly recommend this more than any of the other seasonal polybags released previous to this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
