<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>An impressive sized and fun tree build. Looks great and has a wonderful design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Four present builds that are fun little builds and only two share the same build.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Miniature toy train build is great.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Two minifigures, father and daughter which both look great and have decent prints.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count for the polybag price range works well.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigures are not very unique.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ladder build, while clever and fun, is terrible as a minifigure scaled ladder. The father is shown standing on this model without any issues on the packaging, unfortunately that isn&rsquo;t the case in real life. You can&rsquo;t get him to stand very well on the ladder when on display.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say I am of mixed feelings with this set. On the one hand it is an awesome themed polybag great for the holidays with some great model builds and the numerous toy parcels and toy microbuilds in the set. On the other hand, it can be very difficult to get the father to stand on the ladder, and the minifigure pieces are not unique to this set. Still I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this set to fans of holiday themed building fun and I love the design of the tree here and how they made lights on it.</p>
