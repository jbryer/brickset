<p>Water Scooter Fun is the first new small boxed Friends set of the year, and unlike last year's Splash Pool or the Outdoor Bakery it includes a brand new character in Mini-Doll form, as well as some brand new Mini-Doll parts. 28 Pieces is often the number of parts you'll find in some Polybag sets, this set however is not that, instead it is an 8$ boxed set. Let me rephrase that, buy this direct from LEGO and you will pay 8$, buy it at Retail and you will pay 9$ before taxes, bringing the total to 10$ and change with taxes. A really dissapointing price-per-piece ratio, especially since there aren't a ton of new parts in this set.</p>
<p>There are two models built in this set, using a 4x6 plate in a new light blue/teale color and some tan and brown pieces you make a small dock for the scooter. The build is, pretty simple really and not to enthusiastic compared to other builds. The scooter itself is full of colors, we have white and gray, yellow, light purple and two small clear pink studs. There are really not too many unique parts in the set, or colors, the teal 4x6 plate is nice and there are two of the new petals, so you have a spare for all those spare stems you get in other Friends sets. By this point, counting all the stems I've gotten and all the petals from the 11 Friends sets I've picked up so far, I have nine full stems and a tenth one that needs two more petals before it's perfect. The scooter also uses a brand new control rod piece with longer handles, angled at a curve so that the Mini-Doll can actually hold it. A useful new piece, and functional.</p>
<p>The Mini-Doll's name is Kate, she's another African-American figure, she's wearing a bare midriff revealing top, bikini top if I'm not mistaken, in rich rose and white colors, she's also wearing light blue shorts and some sandals. She uses Olivia's hair in black, has brown eyes and is just a welcome sight to see involving a beach themed set. (You don't go swimming in your clothes, so why should the Friends of Heartlake City?) The print is so detailed there's even a bellybutton.</p>
<p>Overall this set is, while a bit pricey for such a tiny box and the pieces being offered, is a real steal for collectors and young girls (or boys) who want some Friends Mini-Dolls besides the main group of five. She even has the Atlantis Green flippers to use for snorkling or something, I wouldn't say diving, she has no helmet unless you give her one from your Atlantis theme. I recommend this set as a good buy, my only suggestion, try to either get it direct from LEGO or during a sale, which seems to be rarer for the LEGO Friends Theme because in Canada this thing costs way too much at Retail even for a brand new Mini-Doll.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

She is adorable: dark skinned, wearing shorts and a bikini top. My daughter loves playing with her, but in her play scenarios Kate usually hijacks Emma's jeep or Stephanie's convertible or plays with the animals. I have not seen my daughter play with the water scooter and I can't really explain why since Heartlake City playmat comes with plenty of water. Perhaps a little girl who grew up around cars and not water sports does not get the concept or the thrill of a water scooter, or perhpas, Kate is too hard for her to maneuver in and out of the scooter.</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The construction was exceedingly simple and brief given the small number of bricks. The only reason I am giving four bricks for value is because this set delivers a new, unique mini-doll. The reason for five-bricks rating for parts. Perhaps I am ascribing too much value to mini-dolls, but in my household they are easiluy lost, so each one is precious.</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The companion assembly, the pier, is pretty useless, easily lost on the playmat, and lacking a clear function or visual appeal. And it was not until the writing of this review that I realized that the flippers can actually be worn by Kate. Up until now they have been just hanging off the scooter as the booklet shows. Maybe that will get my daughter more excited about the set. I know she gets the concept of swimming with flippers since she uses them herself.</span></div>",TRUE,3,5,3,2,4
"victoria9922","2014-04-08T06:59:46.847Z","Small.","<p>Nice set, but not worth the money. I like the minifigure and the actual waterscooter, but the deck is practically useless. I like the green flippers, too. I would say this is worth $5.00, not $6.99.</p>
