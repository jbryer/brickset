"Odeinoichus","2013-12-21T11:18:24.683Z","Magical Mia and her Mastery of Illusion","<p><strong>Set #41001 Mia's Magic Tricks: </strong>I really fell in love with the 12.99$ priced sets of LEGO Friends for 2012, they had a lot of charm, a great level of detail and fun Mini-Dolls to collect. And while the format of only featuring one Mini-Doll for each set is beginning to wear out its welcome the charm is still there.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Case in point the Box design, while the boxes for 2013 have shrunk in size their presentation is still there and really draws your eye to all of the fun features in the set.</p>
<p>The instructions are fun to look at too, these sets do tend to fold them in half which could be a problem for some, at this price point I don't expect too much for my instructions. Also they have some great cross-promotions in the back showing off the entire early wave of 2013 for LEGO Friends.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This time around there aren't as many unique colored pieces in the set, most of the set is built up with black, red and white pieces while a few gold and purple bits are used for good effect. There's a magic wand for Mia which makes a nice piece, an interesting printed tile and the star decorations which might come in handy for other sets. Other than that, nothing too unique to speak of really.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Mia in this set is dressed up in a tuxedo, she uses the male Mini-Doll legs with the pants for her lower torso and her top is a new print on the female torso piece. It is a great look for the character with a very different flair compared to all the skirts and 'tom-boy' like pants she's worn in past sets.</p>
<p>She includes the same top hat and magic wand that the Series 1 Magician had, and the top hat is more of a set piece honestly. The Mini-Doll just looks terrible with it on, there's no hair peeking out from the bottom so she looks like she's gone bald all of a sudden. It's my only real complaint, the Equestrian Riding hats from some of the sets included detailed hair with the sculpt, now the Top Hat has been a staple piece for a long time, however if LEGO had sculpted a new style of hair piece that could fit on the Mini-Dolls stud with a stud of its own to accomodate the hat, the overall look would have worked much better.</p>
<p>Who knows perhaps it would have cost too much, all I'm saying is the hat just does not work as a head accessory for Mini-Dolls by itself. The design of the Mini-Doll head looks off-putting when wearing it. Other than this, I do think this is an excellent looking Mia Mini-Doll.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There are three components to build, a short table, a vanishing cabinet and a curtained stage opening area. Each build is quick and fun to build, the stage area is smaller than similar designs we've seen in the past (Andrea's Stage from last year comes to mind), but it works for Mia showcasing her talents at a small show for her friends, or the school's talent night.</p>
<p>I think the best build by far is the vanishing cabinet, the design and the parts used just really make it stand out.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The whole package looks great, the stage and table compliment the vanishing cabinet quite nicely. And it works very well, with a clever bit of design to imitate the vanishing of the bunny. The table I feel is a bit too short, nothing an extra 2 x2 cylinder couldn't fix. The stage isn't much, it isn't as extravagant as Andrea's stage or the one in Rehersal Stage, but it's a nice little element with some purple curtains that work well for young builders to play with and introduce Mia to the audience.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'm pretty impressed so far with what 2013's smaller range of Friends sets has set out to accomplish. Not just the typical girl stuff, but actual decent design and set Theme ideas that work well. These sets at this time of the year are selling out fast, they make perfect Christmas presents for fans of LEGO Friends and the target audience of young girls age 5-12 are really going to love them.</p>
<p>If they don't already own this then I definitely recommend it. Mia has a great design and is dressed atypically from what you'd expect a female magician to wear (with flowing robes and cloaks and things) and the models in this set are perfect for play. Don't pass it up, and I suggest checking your local Canadian Targets, they've clearanced these out to 6$ and change.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
