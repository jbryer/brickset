<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set was well packaged and the box was designed to be crush proof. The instructions were broken down in two booklets in such a manner that two children, of varying skill level, could have enjoyed the build at one time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are well packaged and separated.The&nbsp; pieces were packaged in such a way that the set could be built without the &quot;where is this piece&quot; drama that accompanies some sets. The parts the I liked the best were the different flower petal piece that I had not seen before. The were a nice touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two Friends figures. The hair pieces are very well done.</p>

<p>My granddaughter loves these figures and their variety of clothing choices throughout the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The actual build took place last night after a full day of outside play. She was tired, but not yet ready for bed. The introduction of the new set was met with excitement. At first we were only going to let her build the first segment, but after that part was finished, she begged to finish the whole set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Total build time was about two hours including some rebuild time due to missed steps. (She sometimes has problems following the directions everywhere, including school.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set has four separate play areas for sharing or variety in play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This was my first purchase of the larger Friends sets. It will not be my last. Whitney has&nbsp; built&nbsp; or helped built LEGO&nbsp; for several years now including several Creator house sets. Overall, she seems to enjoy this more than any other build. I highly recommend this set over less creative pastime play such as video play etc.</p>

<p>LEGO sets help kids be creative but learn to follow the necessary steps to complete the task.</p>

<p>Thanks LEGO!</p>
