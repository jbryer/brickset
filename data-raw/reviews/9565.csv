<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a decent size, showing you're getting one of the Friends sets and clearly shows which one it is. It's fairly standard on LEGO's part and doesn't' stand out for any glaring problems.</p><p>The instruction booklet has LEGO's easy to follow, step-by-step illustrations for each stage of building with this set. It's also at just the right amount of pieces that it's not too challenging for my daughter like these size sets used to be last year or the year before. There's also a few pages that show all of the Friends, a map of Heartlake city and some of the 2013 sets to get a child like my daughter excited about what other sets in the Friends theme there are. In addition is LEGO's new standard of showing the catalog and listing of all the parts in the set along with the website and phone number for any problems or need to replace parts.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>At $10 for the set, you get a good selection of pieces including several extra pieces. So while the box says 80 pieces, the extras brought it up to about 90. <br></p><p>Notable parts are the flower pieces and extra green stem, two dog bones (one is extra) along with 2 hair bows (again, one extra), banana piece and soccer ball.<br><br>With the extra round pieces and extra nozzle part, my daughter proclaimed making a water bottle for Stephanie to drink from.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I could say that there are two minifigures in this set. The minidoll of Stephanie in a soccer outfit and then her pet dog.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Like many previous Friends sets, the set is built in parts or sections. So for someone like my daughter who's a bit young still, its easy to have her make one part, play with it before moving to the next minibuild.</p><p>What you end up with ultimately is a series of cones for Stephanie to dribble or kick the ball around. Soccer Goal, and a stand where other figures (if you have any) can sit and watch from. <br></p><p>Overall, it's all very decent coming from a $10 dollar set.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is perfect for my daughter who loves the Friends line of LEGO and is also a soccer player. She's spent plenty of time the first day having Stephanie and then her dog ""kick"" the soccer ball around the cones and into the goal.<br><br>It's also great to see the Friends theme clearly move out beyond the ""domestic play"" and showing the Friends doing other activities such as sports.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-05T11:39:35.937Z","Stephanie's Fun Soccer Set","<p><strong>Set #41011 Stephanie's Soccer Practice: </strong>As one of the initial sets in 2013's Winter Wave of LEGO Friends this is one of the better sets available in spite of having such a small number of microbuilds. And here's why.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Stephanie Mini-Doll is a great looking one with some nice new torso printing for her Soccer uniform, she's wearing a dark blue pair of pants which have been seen before though I believe this a new colour for them. 
<li>The microbuild bench/seating area and water&nbsp;cooler is a great looking build, it looks really fun and I love the creative way the water cooler is built. 
<li>Soccer Ball piece hasn't been seen since LEGO Sports Theme, great looking piece with a nice print on it and I love being able to own it again. 
<li>Stephanie's Dog is in this set, not sure if it's meant to be a different puppy from Scarlett, I'm assuming that it actually is. The bow looks goofy and too large on her though. 
<li>Soccer goal microbuild is fun and great to see included. 
<li>Accessories include two bones, a banana and a clear pink mug.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The method for shooting the soccer ball is a small flick gimmic which works nicely. However it is a bit of a waste of parts. 
<li>No extra soccer ball included incase the first one is lost, it would have been nice to have two in the set just in case one of them rolls away somewhere and is lost or missing. The inclusion of a small 2x4 green circular plate to place the soccer ball on is pretty pointless. 
<li>The training section with small orange cones is a bit too short for playing with both the Mini-Doll and the soccer ball at the same time, a slightly wider build would offer up better space for play.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I think this is a pretty great set and totally worth picking up, as one of the cheap sets from the LEGO Friends line it works pretty good, there are a few pointless part inclusions and some of the micromodel builds could have been made a little bit larger. The fact that you get an animal with the Mini-Doll is a nice touch too, and I don't mind only having one Mini-Doll in this set. Hopefully other members of Stephanie's soccer team will be made available in other sets. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
