<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward. My daughter was able to help find the parts whilst I built it whilst she looked on excitedly. There are several components to the set, but the &#39;key&#39; one is the car, which looks good for a small set car.</p>

<h3>Play time</h3>

<p>Once built, my daughter was all over this - she loves cars anyway, but a pink &amp; purple Lego car? it was always going to be a hit. The bench and sign post was soon sidelined as she raced around with the car. And the best bit? No parts came off the car after a full play session in the hands of a 4 year old, so the car has been well built. Most models I build which I then let my daughter play with tend to last a couple of play sessions before I get bored of re-building it for her and are taken apart. This one has stayed in 1 piece&nbsp;and continues to be played with daily.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set for younger children to play with once you&#39;ve built it</p>
