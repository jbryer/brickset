<p>
	This one consists of a cat, an&nbsp;&#39;activity centre&#39; that&#39;ll be immediately recognisable to anyone who&#39;s had a cat (the likes of which you can see <a href=""http://www.petsathome.com/shop/cat/cat-beds-furniture/cat-scratching-posts/"">here</a>), a scratching post and a fish supper.</p>

I think Tammy would run a mile if I tried to tie a ribbon on her head though!</p>
<p>
	There are ten less pieces in this set than in the squirrel house, and overall it seems a lot less substantial, so is not such good value from that point of view. Both sets contained more spare parts than you&#39;d normally see; this one has&nbsp;two extra ribbons and a&nbsp;tan 2 x 2 dish.</p>
<p>
	The instructions quote&nbsp;the URL <a href=""http://www.lego.com/friends/animals/"">http://www.lego.com/friends/animals/</a>&nbsp;that isn&#39;t live yet but will apparently have instructions for combination models using parts from all three sets&nbsp;as well as instructions for&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;models for each set.</p>

Still, at some point, price per brick is just not a meaningful measure. Perhaps for large and huge sets, it is more important: I can picture myself budgeting out my $150 to buy a 2000+ brick set more readily than a 1500+ brick set. But here, for $4.99 you get to surprise your first-grader with a cute new set she can find in her backpack and buid at recess.</div><div><br></div><div>That's the value proposition, to me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's a good stocking stuffer, too.</div><div><br></div><div>The build is over almost before it begins. Not necessarily a bad thing for a six-year-old who has not fully mastered the concept of delayed gratification. But yeah, to this father reviewer, it's only a 3.</div><div><br></div><div>Compared to the turtle set, which is a bit <i>meh</i>, this is very playable lit set. The kitty and the fish are a welcome addition to most of my daughters' play scenarios. The fish can swim in the playmat's ocean, it can be caught and served to the cat -- or, it can become a pet itself, even if it is a grayfish and not a goldfish.</div><div><br></div><div>Scratching post is fun because the most unusual animals -- and objects -- find themselves atop. Same thing with the platform.</div><div><br></div><div>Among the three Series 1 animal sets, this is definitely a hit. I even considered bumping up the build experience rating to 4 -- purely on the promise of combinability of the three sets. But having not opened the squirrle set, I cannot attest to how much fun combining the three sets will be, or how playable the resulting combined will be.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-29T08:48:24.733Z","Animal Series 1 Kitty","<p><strong>Set #41018 Cat's Playground:</strong> The Friends Theme from LEGO introduced these fun little parts packs with animal buddies for the Friends Mini-Dolls. Some of them are ok, some of them are pretty neat, so far though I haven't noticed any mediocre ones.</p>
<p>The Cat's Playground is a bit pricy for 31 pieces, it's basically a glorified Polybag with a different pouch style of packaging that features a lot of small pieces meant to build a little play area for a cat. As someone with a cat in the house I can safely say most real felines tend to avoid running around and scratching the toys you buy them. In LEGO world though you don't have that problem.</p>
<p>The primary model is nice, it uses some dark purple and pink pieces as well as the teal colored rolls. It works for what it's meant to be and the colors are all nice for those seeking variety in colors with their pieces.</p>
<p>The secondary model of a scratching post needs a bit of re-thinking, while it does convey the item in question it is a bit too short and a tad too plain looking. Fortunately there are a few spare pieces in the pouch and with a mixture of other parts you can easily modify this into a much better looking and serviceable scratching post.</p>
<p>The cat gets to enjoy a fish in a pink dish and wear one of three dark pink bows on the top of her head, she's a black with white&nbsp;belly cat which makes for an interesting piece to have your Friends Mini-Dolls take care of.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say, out of all the Series 1 Animals this set unfortunately is the plainest, and yet it still works great for what it's trying to do. Give LEGO Friends fans and others who may be interested in the parts a chance to own some of these elements without spending huge amounts of money on the larger sets. It also gives a quick little build for the children to enjoy on a day when they deserve something for all their hard work saving up their allowances. I'd recommend this one if you can still find it in stores.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
