<p>
 The oasis is actually a very cool beach hut which I&#39;m sure the turtle will be very comfortable in.</p>
<p>
 I thought the white clam shell was new but it&#39;s actually the more common colour <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=30218&amp;in=S"">according to BrickLink</a>. Nevertheless, it&#39;s the first one I have.</p>

<p>
 Now I&#39;ve built all three, I&#39;ll give you my marks out of 10:</p>
<p>
 Squirrel -- 9, the best parts pack and most interesting structure.<br />
 Cat -- 7, cute&nbsp;kitty but light on parts.<br />
 Turtle -- 8, cool model, nice parts.</p>
<p>
 They are all very good and a welcome addition to the Friends range.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-02-11T14:45:55.12Z","Animal Booster Packs","<p>Set #41019 Turtle's Little Oasis: I suppose it was bound to happen, LEGO has introduced as part of its' Friends Theme a small series of 'Booster Packs' or what I consider to be such. The packaging on these things is identical to those of the Ninjago Booster Packs, hence why I chose to call it that.</p>
<p>This is a fun little model, and features a unique animal (the turtle) which is why I picked it up first. The 'Oasis' is a minature Hutch style build, with a small ramp for the turtle to use to climb up into the 'house' area which protects and cools the turtle in the shade using a baseplate roof with a 'frond' tree piece.</p>
<p>The set has a total of five golden telescopes, four of them are used in the model, the fifth is a spare. In fact you also have two spare pink crystal studs and a brown cylinder. You also get three bows, all of which are much too large for the turtle and make her look terrible, they don't look any better on the hairpieces of Mini-Dolls mostly because of the really light purple colouring which clashes with the Mini-Doll hairpieces. There is also a white clam piece, which is a nice addition.</p>
<p>Overall recommended, avoid TRU prices in Canada however as they have raised the price 1$ to 6.99$ which is outrageous for something that Wal-Mart charges 5.86$</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"CandEK","2013-04-15T19:19:06.687Z","Good little kit - Cute animal theme","<p>I bought this for my 7 yo daughter, but actually my 4 yo son put it together! They both loved it. I did too!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Turtle set appealing to both girls and younger boys (not too much pink)<br></li><li>Instruction booklet clear enough for an inexperienced 4 yo to follow<br></li><li>Good, reusable parts: gold telescopes, azure base plate, hinged pieces<br></li><li>Lots of spare parts: gold telescope, brown 1x1 cone, two 1x1 round flat pieces (in girl-friendly translucent pink), two bows</li><li>Potential for lots of enjoyment/playability<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Bow looks ridiculous on turtle (as other reviews mentioned), and even on the friends mini figures<br></li><li>Instruction booklet shows intriguing alternate build but no instructions (I could match the picture after a failed first attempt, but my kids wouldn't have figured it out exactly)<br></li><li>Quirky construction of base - kluge together two mismatched pieces (azure and tan) instead of using one slightly larger base<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I would recommend this set. It's a great as a starter set or as an addition to a larger collection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
