I picked up the&nbsp;three of them in my local <em>Smyths </em>yesterday.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=41020-1"" title=""View set details"">41020</a> Hedgehog Hideaway, as its name suggests, contains a hedgehog, its hideaway, some autumn leaves, a pitchfork and an apple.</p>

<p>Pitchforks first made an appearance in 1980s Castle sets and until their reintroduction in 2011 in an Alien Conquest set they were rare and highly sought-after. Its inclusion in the set is therefore welcome, although perhaps not by a sleepy hedgehog caught on the wrong end of one when hibernating in the leaves...</p>

<p>It may have been more appropriate to have included a bowl of cat food rather than an apple because that&#39;s what we in the UK feed those that venture into our gardens at night. However, Wikipedia states &quot;Hedgehogs feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, melons and watermelons.&quot; so it looks as if they are partial to a piece of fruit now and again.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the cute hedgehog, with a bow in her spines, which must have been challenging, and painful, to attach!</p>

<p>Although hedgehogs appeared in two Friends sets last year, this one has a new print and is unique to this set.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the hedgehog in her hideaway...</p>

<p>Overall, then, you can&#39;t really go wrong for &pound;2.99 / $4.99, particularly as it contains some comparatively rare parts (the pitchfork and dark red leaves) as well as the unique hedgehog.&nbsp;Youngsters who&#39;ve been collecting the first series will adore this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-18T10:13:31.963Z","Oscar the Hedgehog","<p><strong>Set #41020 Hedgehog's Hideaway: </strong>Animals Series 2 continued to feature the new animal pieces from LEGO Friends in cheap little booster packs for fans of the Friends Theme. Let's discuss the pros and cons of this set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The build is quick, will take less than five minutes to finish. 
<li>Oscar the Hedgehog 
<li>Includes a Green Apple piece and Pitchfork</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The main build doesn't use a lot of pieces and is a bit weak 
<li>No place to clip the pitchfork in or any Mini-Dolls to use it, pointless peice to include because of that. 
<li>Animal bows look rather large when placed on the Hedgehog.</li></ul>
<p>For a small bagged set from the Friends Theme this Animals Series 2 set isn't the worst set out of the group, although I've noticed that as we move on from Series 1 it's a bit harder to include the extra pieces in any meaningful way for the build. The animal in this set is what really sells it as the model in it is a bit weak as far as designs for animal houses go, and that pitchfork piece... Utterly worthless, the instructions tell you to lean it against the Hedgehog's house, don't bother as it'll just fall over constantly when you aren't playing with it.</p>
<p>Recommended for the Hedgehog really. He's cute.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,3
