<p>It features a poodle, a &#39;palace&#39;, a grooming table with a brush, and a food bowl with a bone.</p>

<p>As you can see there are&nbsp;plenty of pink and light blue parts in it, so it&#39;s bound to appeal to young Friends fans.</p>

<p>Once again, although the poodle has appeared in other Friends sets, this one has a new print and is unique to this set.</p>

<p>The poodle sits nicely in her &#39;palace&#39;.</p>

<p>Out of the three series 2 sets I would say this is the least appealing for the non-hardcore Friends fan, although&nbsp;girls in the&nbsp;target age group will love it.</p>

<p>So,&nbsp;to summarise&nbsp;my reviews of all three sets, giving scores from a male&nbsp;AFOL perpective:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hedgehog Hideaway: The best of the three: rare and useful parts, not too &#39;girly&#39;. 5/5</li>
	<li>Bunny&#39;s Hutch: Some good parts but the&nbsp;hutch is a bit lame. 3/5</li>
	<li>Poodle&#39;s Little Palace: Strictly one for girls only. 2/5</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more pictures on <em>Canadian Bounty Hunter&#39;s </em><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/canadianbountyhunter/sets/72157633288412915/"">flickr set</a>&nbsp;including some showing the differences between the poodles and the surprising number of spare parts in the set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-18T10:23:16.613Z","Cute little Poodle","<p><strong>Set #41021 Poodle's Little Palace:</strong> This is a pretty cute looking animal set from Series 2 all around, it's also a nice little stocking stuffer for fans of the Friends Theme, be they girls or boys.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The poodle is offered cheaply and looks great with the level of detail involved, not sure what her/his name might be. 
<li>The build looks great, the little palace looks cute and fun and fits in nice for a pet house. 
<li>Two bones for the poodle. 
<li>The table with brush is a nice extra play feature and works great with the mini-dolls from your Friends sets. 
<li>Spare 1x2 bricks are included in this set in pink, orange and white, first time that's happened in an Animal Series set.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The bow accessories just do not look good on any of the animals, they are much too large. LEGO should have made different ribbons for animal pieces compared to the Mini-Dolls or just not bothered.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I'd say this set is a strong offering from the Animals Sub-Theme of LEGO Friends, they work great with Mini-Dolls and are perfect stocking stuffers for this time of the year. (Considering how quickly they've sold out.) All of Series 2 have been added to the Retiring Soon list on LEGO Shop @ home&nbsp;don't miss your chance to own this one, definitely recommended.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3
