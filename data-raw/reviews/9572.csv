<p>It consists of a bunny, a hutch (or rather, a fairly poor excuse for one), an exercise ramp and a carrot.</p>

<p>The hutch is a typical multi-coloured Friends affair, and pretty unremarkable. The exercise-ramp-thing is superfluous and probably just there to pad out the set a bit.</p>

<hr />
<p>Like the hedgehog in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=41020-1"" title=""View set details"">41020</a>, the rabbit has appeared in other Friends sets, but this one sports a new print and is unique to this set.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the hutch, with the hinged roof raised so you can see bunny in it.&nbsp;I&#39;ve added a 2 x 2 jumper tile to the base so that he can sit centrally in it; for some reason one has not been provided.</p>

<p>Little girls, who of course it&#39;s designed&nbsp;to appeal to,&nbsp;will love this set, but it&#39;s not as appealing as the hedgehog hideaway for everyone else because the parts are not as&nbsp;useful. But, still worth 5 bucks of anyone&#39;s money...</p>

Not exactly jaw dropping compared to Andrea's Bunny House, still it's a nice little place and includes a grey rabbit.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Grey bunny is a unique colour and has nice print detail. 
<li>The main model looks great and includes six of the 1x2 brick pieces sculpted to resemble real world bricks. In a nice light brown coloring. 
<li>Includes another carrot and two smaller builds that, well one's a nice little excercise piece for the bunny the other isn't much to write home about.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The carrot stem piece still looks too long when attached to the carrot, more of an aesthetic con really, it just looks wierd and I don't particularly care for it. (Other than that, no real cons to speak of.)</li></ul>
<p>It's a great little set to have, great for stuffing the stocking, by the mantle, under the tree, where ever you might place it. This is a great set for parts too, especially that nice rare brick piece with the sculpted detail work in a rare colour. Strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a carrot plus those brick pieces which i have a few of already so nothing really exciting</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Well there&#39;s a bunny so i dont know if that counts but it&#39;s quite a nice bunny and it&#39;s got a little bow</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took me about two and a half minutes, nothing really excitng</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks fairly decent, there isn&#39;t really much to talk about.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you like bunnies or if you want to collect or the animal sets than get this</p>
