<ul><li>Very playable for an exclusive set.<br></li><li>2 minifigs + 2 vehicles and a trailer is very good value of money.</li><li>The glider is solid, despite being thinly constructed, and well-designed.<br>
</li><li>Very nice torsos (think they're new, but can't check as this is not in bricklink yet).</li><li>Uses the new 'double curved slope' piece (also seen in the town hall window boxes) for the car bumpers/fenders and to hold the glider wings on. Nice part.</li><li>Unusual wheels on the trailer, not commonly seen (by me anyway). <br></li><li>The box is very small indeed (19 x 9.5 x 6 cm), and densely packed. Long may this trend continue.&nbsp;</li><li>A glider is an unusual subject choice (a good thing!) and unlikely to be repeated or duplicated.&nbsp; <br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The car is the standard 'City build' ... car base + wheel arches + a couple of those flats with inverted slopes at each end + a standard 'car front' and 'car back' piece and you're pretty much done. Bunch of POOP as usual (POOP = piece that should be made out of other pieces)! However, that's the way all Lego cars are done these days, so more a general comment than this set in particular. Knocks off 'design' points though.</li><li>Very limited availability.</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Not just the usual City fare, great for a small set.<br></p><p>A good solid set at a good price. <br></p><p><br></p><h4>Anyway, now to the images!<br></h4>
