<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bionicle is one of the large phenomena that surprised LEGO, but in its infancy this was our first real exposure to it, if you weren&rsquo;t following online or with the book releases then Mask of Light was the first look at the universe that encompassed the Bionicle theme. Was it a good film? Well this review shall hopefully help in answering that question.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This DVD was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios and the packaging and overall look of it was quite well executed. This features a shiny image on the front which showcases the titular Mask of Light and the seventh Toa. The back shows other imagery from the special and has a very well done write-up.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This special was animated with CGI and it looks quite crisp despite the relative age of the special.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As there were no freebies included with this I am left to discuss the film and other features. This film picks up a bit after the first story seen on the Bionicle Website left off, in fact this entire film is centered around the third &lsquo;year&rsquo; of the basic Bionicle story, in which the Toa have already defeated the Bohrok and now Mata Nui is threatened by Makuta&rsquo;s Rahkshi forces.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">If you failed to follow the story up to this point you may be slightly confused as to the characters. They are introduced, but not introduced for long as the story must focus on Jaller and his search for the Mask of Light to uncover the identity of the 7<sup>th</sup> Toa. The length of the film is an hour and fifteen minutes and it tells a very decent tale while showcasing the sets of the time quite nicely. The Toa Nuva, the Rahkshi and yes even the Bohrok appear in the special. Some sets would not be available right away upon release of this film if memory serves, Makuta and a few others came out later in that same year&hellip; If I remember the release dates properly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The additional features for this set are fairly impressive, it has a feature length commentary by the group responsible for the Bionicle story, behind the scenes information, deleted scenes, trailers and a sneak peek into the next Bionicle storyline. A lot of special material to enjoy and the film is an A class feature.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This film is one of the must have films for fans of the Bionicle Theme. It features some really impressive animation and voice work, the story is very engaging and even without having followed the main story from the website it is still a fun adventure to watch. A pity they didn&rsquo;t include any bonus LEGO items, receiving a special Toa Mask with this release would have really pumped up the value, however even without it it&rsquo;s a great film to experience and an interesting step-forward for the LEGO company as it represents one of the first special animation projects that they undertook for one of their special Themes.</span></span></span></span></p>
