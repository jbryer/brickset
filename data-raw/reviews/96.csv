"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-26T18:24:04Z","Wow! Finally a Harry Potter building that doesn't have hinges on it!","At first glance, i knew I had to have this set...then I saw the price.  What the $%#@ are these people at LEGO thinking?! A set that has an overall lower brick count that the actual castle selling for more money?! And let's face facts,people, who really wants to buy another Hogwarts Express set, when the one we all bought with Socerer's Stone works just fine even if it doesn't runon a &quot;LEGO track&quot;?
But finally I succumbed to the temptation, bit the bullet and bought it (even though I bought it just for the train station).  The train is ok, but if it sold on its own, I probably wouldn't have bought it. 
The train station, however is Lego at its best. A drainage pipe, bench out front, and that really cool ticket machine (that, for those who haven't bought the set, actually spits out a ticket!!) are just a few of the awesome features of this set.  
So if your a millionare, or just like to save up your pennies, buy this set, you won't be disappointed (well, possible with the train, but that's a mute point).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-11T16:01:33Z","AMAZING****","Simple one of the best sets of 2004, incredibly detailed. This is my first train set and it works wonderfully, the Speed regulator can make the train go in reverse or the forward in the speed you choose, the Hogsmeade station is great also, its very detailded and there are many play features.

The train looks great displayed around the other HP sets like both castles and dumbledores office and etc. definetly a must buy if your a Harry potter lego fan, A Lego train fan, or simply a Lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-18T21:49:11Z","Cool","Very cool Train set, I like it best amongst the High speed train and the cargo train, its the first Hogwarts Express to actually run on lego tracks unlike th eother two which have small wheels that dont work. I would have liked more mini-figs like maybe Hermione and Draco but I guess this is good. Fun set to buld and play with, it alkso looks really good with the other Harry potter sets",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-02T00:55:47Z","best Train set period","This is like the largest Lego train set that already includes both the motor and the speed regulator, and its only 119.99 !! the metroliner was like 170.00 and thats without the speed regulator, this set is the best Lego train set, and the best harry Potter set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

So much better than the Cargo and Highspeed train and you get so many peices for such a better price, you have to get this set and put it under your christmas tree or around your hogwarts castle",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-05T03:08:02Z","Fun","I just picked this up at the Lego brand store in San Jose, and I couldnt wait to get home, althoug I wasn't as excited as with other sets because I already know what pieces will be in the set because of the first hogwarts express. Although it was my first train set and it was fun to see how lego trains work, and you really do get a lot for your buck like others have said because most train sets have less pieces and cost more, and some cost more and dont even have a motor or speed regulator, the Mini-Fig selection isnt much but the train is enough, its a beautiful set on its own or with other train sets.

The only thing that bothers me are the grey bricks in the locomotive, honestly Lego couldn't you just have made those two pieces black?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-26T10:16:37.947Z","way cool!!!","one of the main things i like about this is the bit in the middle as well as the fact that the hogwarts express is motorised, and i know what your thiking, its to pricey but you have to admit it is an excellent model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-12T15:33:16Z","Complete HP Express + Station","Playability: 10. Detail/Design: 9. Piece Selection: 8. Alternate Models: 8. Price: 7. Overall: 8.

I found this set very fun to build, esp. the station which I think is the best part of the set. The structure is built in two parts then fastened together with technic pins as the last step. Details include a working ticket &quot;Pez-type&quot; dispenser that will let passengers take a total of three tickets before having to reload. Details include a treasure chest with some magic items (wand, frog, and magnifying glass), and a secret table upstairs with a 1x2 flat with spider and magic dust. Other nice additions is the maroon pieces used as entry way, window frames, and downspout. Lastly, the lamp and Hogsmeade sign with owl adds more detail. This building makes a nice addition to your town (with/without HP accessories).

The train is nice with red and black color design but is missing some detail that would have made a better model. The engine reminds me of the MOT line but includes HP front boiler piece and an opening boiler to put the coal in. The mechanism to fling coal is uneeded.

I like the coal car but the third inner wheel does create friction and slow down the train. This is awkward and I removed mine. I like the opening hatch to put in cole or hide figs. 

The passenger car could use some work. The first obvious problem is no door? The inside lacks detail (didn't even include lego chairs, but rather just bricks for chairs and table. And I don't like the removal of most of the upper section to put your figs in. A roof that lifts off would have been better. I do like the red train windows and 1x1 &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; sign pieces. Lastly, this car is also missing a middle under section.

The set does include motor, transformer, round circle of track + two straights for an oval. Unfortunately, (and probably my biggest dissapointment) is the blue-ish gray track. Why the track color change? Beyond me...

Overall, I rate this set an 8. It's a lot of fun and the station is esp. fun to build. Best on sale but I would buy again. I could see the HP fans really enjoying it!

"SweetBoy","2005-08-04T07:54:38Z","Fun but Slightly flawed","A great Harry Potter set, with a fun new station, especially the great ticket dispenser, provides many play hours. The problem is the addition of a tender between the engine and the carriage which is not provided with swivelling wheels.  This means that it cannot take the curves in the track and the train keeps derailing itself. Removing the tender erases the problem but begs the question why was it ever included?  That aside a fun addition to any fans collection",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lostcarpark","2007-04-07T08:40:36.273Z","One of the best train sets in years","This set may seem pricey, but compared to other recent Lego trains sets, it's pretty good value for money, especially considering the royalties Lego pay for the license. The train isn't bad, though I would have liked big driving wheels on the loco (but I have the same complaint of every 9V steam train). There are some nice details, such as the chute for shovelling coal. The tender looks nice, though having 3 axles without articulation, it can be a bit sticky going around bends. I would have liked a 28 stud base and doors on the coach, rather than the lift-off top half, but it looks nice, and is just asking for a custom rebuild. The station looks small, but is very nicely done, with lots of nice details like drain pipes. All in all, this has a lot to offer both train fans and HP fans, and if you like both you'll be in heaven.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Unlike many other peoples reviews i bought it for the track and train. It was at &#163;30 pounds because the parts that made up the station were missing. I took it and didn't regret it!

"LegoAdventures","2011-03-13T00:26:37.787Z","Motorized Hogwarts Express","Absolutely Phenomenal. That is the first thing I would say when describing this Immaculately designed set. This set was the first and only Exclusive set to the Lego Harry Potter series (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Now there is the Exclusive 10217 Diagon Alley set 2011 which makes 2 Exclusive sets to the Harry Potter series, not counting the TRU Exclusive Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw Quidditch Stand</span>), and it is exceedingly rare. I never managed to get this set when I was young, but I remember wanted it to my hearts content. I remember looking on LEGOshop@home and never every saw it on there, I also just tried looking at the price and availability on LEGO.com and it said it wasn't available in Australia, however after clicking almost all of the majority of country's available even Denmark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">LEGO's country of origin</span>, and finding out that it said it wasn't available there or any of the other country's I clicked on I realized it had been discontinued. However it didn't end there, I searched everywhere for this set including the major top departments that took there products seriously like David Jones and Myer, even Toys 'R' Us didn't have it nor did Casey's Toy World, Target, BIG W or even Kmart. I finally decided to consult my inquiries to the World Wide Web and went to eBay.com.au when I found none available. I finally forgot about the set and moved on until ... I started getting back into Harry Potter LEGO and I found a website that made all my dreams come true ... <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span>. I went on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span> and found this set, until then I wasn't aware that the site even existed but then I found it and I finally managed to get the LEGO 10132 Exclusive Motorized Hogwarts Express in a New Sealed Box in Phenomenal Condition not even opened from the Box LEGO shipped it in for $300 AUD, and I can strongly say it was well worth it for this Magnificent set.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Released in 2004 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it contains 706 Pieces, 4 Mini-figures, Hogwarts Express (Engine, Tender and Passenger Car) and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> Station. It is undoubtedly the rarest and most Exclusive set in the Harry Potter series and one of the best Harry Potter sets every created. Now lets get on to the set. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>Now firstly I would like to say that there is a lot in side this Box and I mean a lot which is why it is so heavy. The Box is 57cm Long, 38cm Tall and 9cm Thick. It consists of the usual offerings that you would find like the front Illustration of the Hogwarts Express, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> Station with the enchanted starry sky and dreamy moon with Hogwarts in the Background. I actually think that the Box art is one of my favourite and most appealing e designs created. You also have the Red LEGO insignia, Blue Hogwarts Wall patterns around the Back, Sides and small section on the front. You also have 1 Alternative Model of the set on the back of the Box and numerous Illustrations of the set. There is also an image of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets, however they are all White-Trans see through except for the Motorized Hogwarts Express which is in colour. Around the side of the Box there is the usual Trademarks, Licensed Agreements, Future References and where the Components are made, for this Particular set the Components are made in Denmark, Switzerland, Hungary, China, Korea and Malaysia. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">A very large and strange amount of Country's involved indeed however I presume that the pieces are made in Denmark, Switzerland and Hungary and the Box, Instructions or Packaging is made in China and Korea and all the electrical wiring and other electrical things are made in Malaysia</span>) Because that's what I love and most people love about LEGO is that it's Quality European Manufactured. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Box as I mentioned earlier there is a lot. First of all when you open the Box which is just a simple swipe (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">With a knife, if you want to keep your Box in good condition for future purposes</span>) between the two bits of sticky tape holding the Box together. That's one thing I love about this Box is it's very clean and simple to open it. Anyway when you open it you will find: 1 Medium Sized White Box (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">28.5cm Long, 19cm Tall and 7cm Thick</span>) which contains 18 pieces of 9V Train Track pieces (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Track with the Metal Lines on top - also very rare now</span>) 2 Straight and 16 Curved. 1 Small Sized White Box (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">9.3cm Long, 9.3cm Tall and 5.7cm Thick</span>) which contains a Black Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Power Adaptor for 120v 60Hz Wall Adapter Plug-in. 1 Huge Classic and Very Rare Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Complete Assembly (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ultra Rare, It even has the Old LEGO logo on it from 1972-1999</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">on the top corner</span>). Some electric LEGO Electric Train Track Contacts with Wire and 2 x 2 x 2/3 Brick wiring that connects to the Speed Regulator and the Tracks. 1 Electric Train Motor 9V with Chrome Silver Wheel Outlines. 2 Electric Train Motor 9V Decora<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>tive Sides. 2 Black Train Base's 6 x 24. 6 Train Magnets. 1 Large sheet containing Information about the Electricity in the set. 1 Sticker Sheet with 8 Stickers. 1 Small 2003 LEGO catalog. 1 Free LEGO catalog Request Membership, 5 Bags Numbered 1-5 for a quicker, neat and smooth build. And last but not least the 50 Page Instruction Booklet, 60 Including the Illustrations at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Remus John Lupin</span> also Known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Moony</span> or <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor R.J Lupin:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>Professor Lupin features his Wavy-Styled Dark Orange Hair (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Identical to Gilderoy Lockharts Hair piece</span>).
 He features Sparkling Innocently Calm eyes, slightly raised Black 
eyebrows, a lovely Quirky sort of smile and curled Grey Moustache with 
2long diagonal Salmon-Flesh claw scratches along his face. His Torso 
features a Dark Olive Green Suit and a light Mint Green work T-Shirt 
with a Jet Black Tie that seems to have a very small tear. Going down <br>his
 Suit he has 2 Silver buttons with 2 Black holes in each. His Suit also 
features 2 Pockets and 3 tears around the Chest and bottom of the Suit. 
He has Dark Olive Pants and a Beautiful Light Stone Grey Cape resembling
 his Robes. Lupin features a Brown Wand.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br>Dementor:</span> 
""The Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures that walk this Planet"",
  a  once wise Professor Lupin said to Harry and to be honest I think  
Lego did an Astronomically wonderful job on the creepy design factor.  
The Dementor looks Diminishing, vile, cruel and spooky. It features a 
Sand Green face which looks like it's Sucking the Soul out of  someone 
and it's Skeletal body and loose Skeletal arms covered with a  tatty 
Cloak with one leg resembling It floating give It an image  that could 
chill the bone. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Harry James Potter: </span></span>Harry Potter features his Black Messy hair, Red scar, Round glasses with Sparkling eyes and simple smile. His Torso features a Grey Jacket with Pockets and underneath that is a Crimson Red Sweater. Last of all the features Navy Blue pants. Harry features a Black Wand. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ron Bilius Weasley: </span></span>Ron Weasley features his Mopped Orange hair, Sparkling Black eyes and Orange freckles underneath and his quirky smile. His torso features a Chestnut Brown Jacket with Pockets and and a very nice Purple lined and Green Lined Sweater. Last of all he had Grey pants. Ron features a Grey Wand. <br><br><h4>Hogwarts Express:</h4><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Engine: </span></span>What a marvelous Engine. You start of with the Black Base plate and start Building the starting foundations. You place numerous Red Slopes, 2 handles to control the Train, The front lights for the Train and the walls for the sides of the Boiler section. You also place 2 Black 1x8 Flat Tiles on the bottom of the Boiler floor. You then Build a small Mechanism which can tilt and goes behind the 2 Black 1x8 Flat Tiles. Later on you place a Grey Shovel on the Tender, basically you get the Grey Shovel and inside the Tender there is around 20 Black studs and 5 Grey studs which you can pick up put them in the mechanism, tilt the mechanism forward so they role into the boiler and slide and roll in the Flat Tiles then tilt the mechanism back so they can't fall out. You then build the roof for the Boiler and the Windows for the Driver compartment. You also place other Train features on the top like the section where the smoke comes out. You also place the round Black Dish on the front of the Engine which reads <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogwarts Express 5972. </span>You build the two small wheels at the front with 1 Magnet connector, and then the 9V Electric Train Motor with 1 Magnetic Connector and 2 Electric Train Motor 9V Decorative sides attached to the sides. And last but not least the stickers for the Engine. Now I know stickers are a huge frustration, so what I do is I think about how I'm going to place them on first. Then I very carefully place it on as straight as I can with patience, Be very slow and patient because you have all the time in the world. Sometime don't flatten the sticker all the way because then you can get a Knife or needle pin to carefully lift the side up and try getting it straight again. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tender: </span></span>Now this is one of my favourite details of the set. You start by building 3 Black Wheels with 2 Magnet Connectors, a Black Side ladder and the walls of the Tender. Throughout the Tender building process you construct a compartment with a roof on top which allows you to open it up and place things inside. You place some little features which make the Tender look very realistic and lifelike looking. Inside the compartment you place 1 Cyan Blue Suitcase, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Monsters Book of Monsters</span> and an Orange Spider. You also place about 20 Black studs and 5 Grey Studs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">resembling Coal</span> in a small section for the Boiler which I mentioned earlier. You also place a Grey Shovel to put the Coal in the Boiler. And last of all the stickers. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Passenger Car: </span></span>You start with another large Black Base plate with numerous starting foundations and the Brown Tables and Seats. Then you place a mixture of Flat Tiles and studs so when you've built the Roof you can place it on and take it off with ease. You build the set of Wheels with Magnet connectors so now you can connect the Train Together after you have finished the Passenger Car. The thing that I love about this set is that the Windows are filled so they look like Glass. Now I can have Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Ginny, Neville etc all in there Cosy and Warm and protected from the Rain hehe. You also place a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed</span> Flat tile with a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">HoneyDukes</span> Chocolate with one Bite in it on one of the tables.&nbsp; There is also the 2 Stickers on the sides and the Yellow and Black Compartment Numbers on the side that say 1 and 2. Last of all you place the Black Roof Slopes, Grey Roof Vents and Scabbers Ron's Rat on the Roof lol. <br><br>Now you can connect the entire Train Together and make it run along the Track all day long, a truly marvelous Train set. <br><br><h4><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> Station:&nbsp;</h4><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> Station is a truly Remarkable design. You begin by building the floor and the Arch way entrance. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> station features a beautiful combination of Crimson Red, Sand Green, Blacks and Grey s it truly looks magnificent. You then place a Black Triangle shaped LEGO piece for the top floor, this allows you to have a second floor but also allows you to still be able to play within the bottom section, a very clever design indeed. On the bottom floor you place a Chestnut Chest which contains 1 Quantum Purple Magnifying Glass -Quiet Rare, 1 Emerald Green Frog -Very cute and 1 Cream Wand. You also build a small Fireplace for the top level. Which consists of a small formation with an arch on top and 1 small Trans-Orange stud in the center resembling a Classic Fireplace -very cosy and cute. You also place a combination of Light Grey Bricks with Dark Grayish Blue Bricks to created an Incredible Brick effect, it really does look amazing. You then finished with some Sand Green roof tiles, a Crimson Window with 2 Inner White Window shutters which can open and close and a Chimney formation. There is also a long Grey Poll with a sign <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed</span> that reads <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span>. On top of the Sign and Poll is a Brown Owl. You also place a Red Trolley Carrier which holds a White and Brown Suitcase. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second part of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> that you build is again a formation of Light Grey and Bluish Grey Bricks. There is a small Brown Table with a Flat Tile on it that shows a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed </span>Grey parcel wrapped up in Gold Lacing. You also make the Ticket Dispenser Mechanism, Basically what you do is you build the Ticket Dispenser and Cash Register Mechanism first you make a long piece of LEGO that goes through the Ticket Mechanism Dispenser and the Wall to the outside of the Station. Covering this is the Cash Register, a Flat Tile with a Money Bag <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed</span> on it and a small Flame or Fire in a Black Cylindrical Piece. On the outside of the wall there is a small Compartment and on the front of the Compartment is a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed</span> Sign which is resembling <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Get Train Tickets here</span>. You place 4 Chrome Gold coins in the Compartment, then you pull the long LEGO piece running through the Ticket Dispenser and Wall from the outside and a LEGO Tile with a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed</span> Ticket on it comes out (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The tickets has a Train Emblem on them</span>). To replace the Ticket you take of the Cash Register inside the Building and put the 2 Tickets back down on the long LEGO piece. You place a Black Triangle piece exactingly the same as the floor earlier in the first <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogsmeade</span> section. You then make a small table mechanism which you can open to reveal a Flat Tile with a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printed </span>sack that has a Bone and a Black Spider coming out of it with Gold Stars. You then place a Yellow Cup/Mug on top of the table and a Flame of Fire on a Black Cylindrical piece. You finish off with the Sand Green roof formations and Crimson Windows with White inner Windows and a White Owl on the roof. After you have built the second part of Hogsmeade you connect both together via 2 tubed LEGO pieces. It looks Incredible!. Another nice feature is a Drain-Pipe going down from the Roof to the bottom of the set, and a Grey Poll with a Light on top which you place at the end of the station. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm sorry if there was some things you didn't understand, however it was very difficult to describe some mechanisms and features in the set, I did try my best. If you didn't understand a peice or anything else simply download the Instructions from Brickset.com or go to Peeron.com go to the search bar, search 10132 and you can see the Instructions and set Inventory there.<br><br></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><h4>Overall:</h4><br>Overall this set is absolutely Outstanding in every way. It is a marvelous set full of amazing features that will keep you and your imagination going for Hours upon Hours. I completely and utterly recommend this set with the utmost full Confidence that you will enjoy it. A complete Triumph! 5/5<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review :) <br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"dsdoak","2011-06-24T14:03:05.397Z","The best Hogwarts Express yet!","<p>This set is much better than the original Hogwarts Express (which didn't have a tender) and the newer one which is not as attractive in my opinion. However, I would like to see more passenger cars included in future train sets. Few real trains would have only one car attached. Luckily I have two of these so I can have two passenger cars. A modification I made was placing two motors on the engine to give the train more power, else it goes painfully slow on turns and can't pull the weight of two cars and a tender.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Train is attractive</li><li>Engine opens</li><li>You can actually put coal in the engine from where the engineer stands!</li><li>The tender is awesome and has a secret compartment!</li><li>It comes with a station</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The tender derails on some turns (I solved this problem by taking out the middle pair of wheels)</li><li>There is only one passenger car</li><li>The engine and cars looks very sharp and blocky, unlike the newer Emerald Night steam train</li><li>There is not a lot of track for the train</li></ul>
<p>All in all, this is a nice set. It is an ideal starter set, but train collectors will want to add more cars and track so you don't get dizzy from the train going around in circles (ovals actually). This makes a nice addition to a Lego city and also makes a good Christmas train (the set comes with enough track to fit around an average sized tree).</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
