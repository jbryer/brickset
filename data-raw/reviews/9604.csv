This set of discs includes all 13 episodes from Season One and is a very nice offering.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The case is designed to inspire the threat of the Serpentine and the Great Devourer with a scaly pattern seen behind the shot of all the ninja and Sensei Wu. The back has a write-up on Season One and a complete listing of episode titles per disc. Overall a decent case design, the discs themselves are colour coordinated. One is green with Lloyd&rsquo;s masked face printed while the other is red with Kai&rsquo;s masked face printed there. It&rsquo;s very colourful and easy to know which disc to start watching first.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again this is a non-bonus release, which means LEGO did not include any Polybags or bricks with the seasonal set. Overall it might have been interesting to see unique polybags offered with each season, but I suppose LEGO and WB hadn&rsquo;t teamed up fully at this point to cross promote one another.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The first disc features the first six episodes of the season. The menus are very colorful and fun looking, though they include the theme playing in the background on repeat, which may get annoying if left alone for too long. No bonus content.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Disc two includes the remaining seven episodes from the season with the exact same menu design and no bonus material. This was overall quite familiar to me, I had seen these episodes back when they aired quite frequently, and it was enjoyable to watch them again. Not much else to discuss, the animation of Season One is extremely upgraded compared to the two Pilot Episodes. Already improvements were being made. The overarching plot was fairly decent as well with focus being shown on Kai and Lloyd.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a great looking little item. It&rsquo;s a nice way to get all of the first season to watch. LEGO has since made a budget release even more impressive with both Season One and Two included in the set, which is just the same four discs as the individual releases at a better price. So in this case I would recommend tracking down and picking up the two seasons in the one release if you haven&rsquo;t already seen the first two seasons of LEGO Ninjago Masters of Spinjitzu. So despite this being a highly impressive release I&rsquo;d say skip it. This release Not Recommended.</p>
