And this was, of course, the first series ever, so this should be exciting, but I won&#39;t give my full opinion until the end of the review, so stay tuned for that. And let&#39;s jump right on in!</p>

<p>So first, let&#39;s discuss the 5 out of 5 figures, and this time there is 4 of them. Those figures would be the Caveman, who does look a little odd with no side leg printing&nbsp;but still looks great; the Circus Clown who has some great printing, and a great hairpiece, as well as that incredible afro piece, and that amazing horn piece; the Robot who, while isn&#39;t the best CMF robot, still looks great; and the Magician looks amazing with the hat, wand, and extra hair piece.</p>

<p>Then we have the 4 out of 4 figures, those being the Tribal Hunter who has a great hairpiece and some pretty good accessories; the Cheerleader looks good, with her blue and white pom poms; the Spaceman has some awesome printing, and while he is also not the best CMF astronaut figure, he&#39;s still cool; and then the Forestman is also pretty cool.</p>

<p>Next up we have the 3 out of 5 figures, those figures being the Skater who has some nice torso printing and a great skateboard piece; the Super Wrestler, who, while being an odd choice, looks pretty good; the Nurse who is a great choice and looks cool too; and the Deep Sea Diver, who is another great choice and looks pretty good overall.</p>

<p>Then we have the 2 out of 5 figures, and this time there&#39;s only one, and that would be the Zombie who is a great choice, but just doesn&#39;t look all too glorious and splendid.</p>

<p>And lastly we have the 1 out of 5 figures, and those would be the Demolition Dummy which is just a Crazy choice and doesn&#39;t look very good; and then we have the Ninja who looks pretty boring; and the Cowboy who is a great idea, but isn&#39;t executed real well, especially compared to the Series 13 Sheriff.</p>

<p>And the total score is 53, which isn&#39;t a bad score. Not the best, but certainly not the worst either, and that&#39;s really just what I think about this series. Could be better, but could definitely be worse. And I think that wraps up this review, so thanks for reading. And if you want to buy these figures, you can fork over 20 to 40 bucks on eBay... I won&#39;t be buying any of them any time soon, but you can if you would like. Back in the day, this WAS two bucks, which was an excellent price! Now its five so...yeah. Anyways, thanks for reading!</p>
