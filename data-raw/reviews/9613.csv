<p>Which is just what I am doing today! I will be writing my personal opinion on the series, and talking about my favorites... and least favorites. So let&#39;s just jump right on in!</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s talk about the 5 out of 5 figures, and for me those are the Mariachi who has some excellent pieces; the Spartan Warrior looks great, with his pieces and prints; and the Surfer Dude has some awesome prints and is just a nice choice.</p>

<p>For me, the 4 out of 4 figures are the Vampire who is a nice choice and looks pretty sweet; the Traffic Cop does look nice, with that 1x2 print; the Mime, who has some great side arm printing, and looks good; the Weightlifter has some nice prints and looks pretty good; the Disco Dude has a nice color for that hair; the Karate Master has some nice prints; and lastly, the Pharaoh has some awesome pieces, and looks cool.</p>

<p>There actually is no 3 out of 5 figures, so let&#39;s move on to the 2 out of 5, and there is a lot of them, those being the Witch who is a nice choice, but just isn&#39;t executed too well; the Explorer who has a good hat piece but nothing else; the Lifeguard, who isn&#39;t really that interesting; the pop Star, who has good hair but nothing else; and finally, the Skier who has those great ski pieces, but a very boring figure.</p>

<p>And there is also no 1 out of 5 figures, so let&#39;s just get to the final score. And that would be 54, which in my rating, is only one score higher than Series 1. And this series was only 2 bucks, which was an amazing price. And this series was blue, which WAS a unique choice until 3 series&#39; later. Oh well. Still, this is a nice series. And I think that wraps up this review! So thanks for reading!!!!</p>
