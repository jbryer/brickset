depicts. Rather than black wings, it's a jumble of grey, black and dark 
grey. But for 40p from The Sun, who can complain really?<br><br><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Detailed for it's size<br></li><li>Pose-able wing tips, engines and cockpit.<br></li><li>Looks great next to the mini bat car.<br></li></ul>

Quick and easy, it is ideal for children as it can be built fast and they can play with it straight away. It has moving parts as well so for such a little set, I recommend it highly.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-12-07T16:54:16.073Z","CUTE!","<p>Hello everybody! Sideswinger here, reviewing the LEGO Avengers Quinjet polybag set, which was released in 2012 to coincide with the 2012 Avengers film. It includes 33 pieces, and it was released as a promotion in The Sun newspaper back in the day. It goes for about 4 dollars new nowadays, though. Let&#39;s just take a closer look!</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>I normally start reviews by discussing the minifigures included, but since there are none, I suppose I&#39;ll start with a brief look at the build. Honestly, it isn&#39;t the most amazing micro-scale build out there, but it is cute, for what it is. I like the use of those triangular pieces on the tips of the wings, and the translucent cockpit looks pretty sweet. But at the end of the day, this is just a polybag build, so it isn&#39;t super amazing.</p>

<p>Experience:</p>

<p>Obviously, if you&#39;re looking for an interesting build to pass the time, this is totally not the set for you. Being as small as it is, it doesn&#39;t offer any long and interesting processes. However, if you&#39;re taking a road trip, or perhaps even a plane trip, I think this set could possibly help kill time.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>I basically have to repeat myself: this doesn&#39;t offer any amazing play aspects, but honestly, I would have really enjoyed playing with this as a kid. I do think it could be fun for road trips, though.</p>

<p>Final verdict:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is just a polybag, so of course it isn&#39;t crazily interesting. But in general, it doesn&#39;t have a bad build. I&#39;m gonna have to give this set a 4 out of 5, because it really isn&#39;t a bad set at all! That is it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
