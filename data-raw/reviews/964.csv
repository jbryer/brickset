We got given a mixed box of used 1970's Lego which started us on the hobby. The strange 'large people' we used less but these came mixed with 'little people' who we found much more playable and interactive. Best among all the confusing parts that we trashed from '261' the blue baseplate could be nothing but a little people swimming pool and thus it was built as such.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures &amp; Maxifigures</b></div><h4>[路路][路路]</h4><div><div><ul><li>Old grey hair!</li></ul></div><div>One maxifigure, not quite a granny (theres one with spectacles and grey hair) receives black plate shoes, yellow legs, a red skirt and blue torso. She also gets to brandish a brown hairbrush and hairdryer.&nbsp;The minifigure or 'baby' has a white bodysuit and red girl hair. She gets a mirror or is that rattle to hold?</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>1970's Girly Playset</b></div><div>The shame, now I realise as boys we possessed a broken down girly playset, no its not that bad at all actually. The brilliant taps, cupboards and shelves were always used for minifigures and these chrome plated sections are probably quite hard to find now. I wince when i think of how we treated these parts including that smooth blue baseplate. Its a weird carpet that I would have expected to be studded and bumpy but perhaps its linoleum to mop up after the baby splashes about (thats no baby that's the Town Clerk's wife!).</div><div><br></div><div>The builds are pretty enjoyable if you like a giant bath and toilet, always a giggle for kids to build. The smooth white tiles were particularly effective for the bath bottom and while the toilet can not open as well as being inoperable, this is probably for the best. This set is all about cleaning and grooming oneself... and that baby.</div><div><br></div><div>Little jars, pots and flowers also adorn this bathroom and make it quite homely if a little odd in design but its 1970's and is a good build with a well rounded outcome. I can never help feeling that the bathroom is flooded but thats because we only ever used this as a swimming pool, a pond or sea shore. Just keep auntie (?) and her hairdryer away from that bath!</div><div><br></div><div>The stickers: I have no memory of the mirror or hanging towel, I think it was either lost before we got to trash it or... we trashed those also, ouch.</div><div><br></div></div></div><div><b>Throw The Baby Out With The Bathwater?</b></div><div>It was a strange time that blended little and large figures to such effect but this does not detract from what is a classic time in Lego sets for the development in play and basic building techniques. A favourite piece would be the sink or shelves but they don't go far without the right placement in a build. I would not write this off as a girly or 1970's set because as we found, it is still adaptable to make more of, even it means filling with water. Yes I think we may have done that too.</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,4
