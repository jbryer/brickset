<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of soldiers for each side</li><li>Green Dragons now get a sort of official leader too!</li><li>Lots of shields for once!</li><li>Mostly nice weapons, especially all the axes</li><li>Pieces won't be displaced if you put the game aside for a while with the game in progress</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I'm not sure why they made the rooks actual towers instead of mini figures, it's sort of disappointing - but at least you get big shields from them for army purposes</li><li>If you actually play chess with the set, it can feel a bit crowded trying to move the figures&nbsp;</li><li>The flails don't look that good (would've preferred swords), same with the very plasticky-looking corseques</li><li>Could've used some neck protector helmets on the pawns perhaps?</li><li>The Jesters aren't that nice if you're using this as an army-builder set instead of chess set</li><li>Kind of unfortunate that the Green Dragon pawns all have the silly face</li><li>The outer plastic stuff with the towers etc is kinda ugly, would be much nicer if it was built from bricks - though I suppose those willing to pay the extra can just get the bricks and do it for themselves!</li></ul>
<p>I listed a lot of cons, but honestly they're very minor things compared to the good stuff. This set is a great value for money given how many figures you get, and works great as an army builder set, while also being usable for chess.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
