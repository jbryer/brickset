I had to buy this because of the cool clock and the glow-in-the-dark ghost. Luckily one of the LEGO shops (not official) in my country got dozens of this from Germany, so I found it here too.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I can't tell anything about the box, because...there is no box! Anyway, it's a polybag promo with a small folded paper which contains the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I has calculated 33 parts + 3 extra parts which is very nice amount compairing to other polybags. The main colour is brown, but there are white, black, light grey and tan parts too.</p><p>The parts are pretty useful, and there are some rare elements (the short chain, the 2x2 round plate with the clock pattern, the ghost and so on).<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Probably this is the best-looking bad guy in the whole theme. Not too scary and realistic, but not too toy-like and sweet. Anyway, it's a very cool minifig with glow-in-the-dark element (it really works when you leave it out on the sun for a while, and then you bring it back to a dark room) and the chain. Our ghost is a bit shorter than I expected, but almost the same size as a ""classic"" minifigure. But in conclusion, I like it very much!<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Takes ~2 minutes. Nothing special.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The ghost is pretty good, and the clock is nice too. Maybe it contains too much of the brown elements - with some dark brown elements would be even better. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Well, it's not cheap, but you get a nice-looking clock with a nice ghost, and those contains useful and rare elements. It's basically an accessory like other polybags, but it works really good in that case. So I can recommend this for every LEGO fans, particularly if you find it under $3. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading this review along, and sorry for my bad English grammar :D.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3

"Odeinoichus","2012-11-30T14:20:04.483Z","Tick, Tock, Hickory Dock","<p>Set #30201 Ghost(&amp; Clock): A brilliant Monster Fighters Polybag you're going to want to have more than one of to build an army of glow-in-the-dark ghosts.</p>
<p>That's pretty much all there is really to say about this set, however that wouldn't make much of a review now would it? The clock model included in this set is a pretty interesting accessory for the Ghost, it uses mostly brown pieces and includes a printed round plate with the clock face on it. The pendulum doesn't move, that is however asking a bit much from a LEGO model this small.</p>
<p>The Ghost is an excellent Mini-Fig. This version is different from the one found in the Ghost Train as it features a small ball and chain, it of course glows in the dark quite well. The set includes enough pieces as spares that allow you to change the look of the ghost, if you buy more than one of this set you can modify the build any way you'd like for the placement of the ball and chain.</p>
<p>I rate this set fairly high and it is definitely one you'd want to have more of especially for MOCs where you'd like to include a bunch of different grand father clocks. (Such as a shop or several Modular Houses.) Definitely worth picking up.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
"brianashe","2012-10-05T22:50:06.36Z","Just a couple quick notes about how great this set is","First of all, this is a fantastic set if you have a little one who is big into minifigs, as many kids are. It's a great little Halloween treat for your kid. Most kids won't get too excited about the clock, but if you tell them ""it's a haunted house clock"" you might be surprised -- they'll probably think it's pretty cool. Mainly, though, the ghost is a great little character, and at four bucks you can't beat it.<div><br></div><div>Secondly, the glowing on this thing is AMAZING. I literally don't think I've ever seen anything glow this well in my life. It ""charges"" fast, starts off SUPER bright, and stays brightly lit for a LONG time. Hit it with an LED and watch out. It looks fantastic. I'll be out to buy more before they disappear. (No pun intended. :-) )</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2012-11-12T13:12:43.07Z","Great accessory to your hounted house","This polybag set makes a great accessory to your haunted house. The clock fits the interior of the house nicely and is approximately the size of the clothes cabinet. The chain makes a nice variation on the typical ghost characters in the theme. Overall, a nice little candy set for you monster fans out there.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Kooz","2013-02-26T20:51:08.057Z","The embodiment of all that's good in LEGO","<p>This is the first LEGO I picked up, triggering a relapse into a LEGO habit I thought I broke 20 years ago. &nbsp;For this review to be helpful, I'll be brief.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's a polybag, so no box. &nbsp;The artwork is beautiful though, as it is on the whole Monster Fighters line.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a clock face, which is cool and a bit different. &nbsp;There's also a ball and chain, which is apparently pretty rare. &nbsp;Plus there's the ghost (more on that below). &nbsp;In all, for 33 pieces, you get some good stuff.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The ghost is beautiful. &nbsp;He feels great--sturdy, matte-finished, with a little heft. The glow-in-the-dark is stunning--a bright green. &nbsp;His spooky frown is a nice change from the earlier LEGO ghosts.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The build</b></p><p>The build was fun, if short. &nbsp;For 33 pieces you get to spend a few minutes making a straightforward grandfather clock and ghost. &nbsp;Nothing unique, but still fun.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It is simply fantastic. &nbsp;I know of no other polybags that say so much with so little. &nbsp;This has two components--the clock and the ghost, but it sets a mood all by itself. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>LEGO has changed so much from when I was a kid, and all for the better. &nbsp;This set is the embodiment of all that is right in LEGO. &nbsp;It gets the most out of its low piece-count. &nbsp;This is a must-have set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Quietman113","2020-05-13T15:49:04.97Z","Great update on a classic.","<p>When this polybag came out i knew i needed to get it. It was the first time in over&nbsp;a decade that the classic glow in the dark ghost was released by Lego. This updated version did a good job of making a more &quot;spooky&quot; version of the ghost than the old smiley faced one. The clock was a good build for such a simple object. It also makes a fine little desk display, put the ghost on top of the clock and it stands just fine.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-11-02T22:02:02.813Z","Great polybag!","<p>For the figure we have a ghost. With a plain white brick as legs. But getting a ghost is always good and getting some plain white normal legs is very cheap if you don&#39;t already have one.</p>

<p>Build experience, not much as it&#39;s a Polybag.</p>

<p>The clock itself actually looks really nice. It doesn&#39;t have any functions but it&#39;s a very nice polybag model and great&nbsp;to spice up your Haloween display.</p>

<p>For the parts we have a printed clock, a signal panel and some other bits and bobs.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a great polybag with a nice figure and build.</p>
