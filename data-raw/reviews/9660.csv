Otherwise whats the point of drilling the ground","<p>Well with the mining theme having many junior -ized parts this is a great adition if you have mining 4x4. The only thing i don't like is the absense of gold to mine for, but a rock could be even better. I know&nbsp; boulder peices would not be fair normal in a small set like this becuase they could get damaged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Place of purchase (in north america)</strong></p>
<p>I got this&nbsp;in the goody bag at the&nbsp;august lego club meeting with mining as the theme it was very fun but I was hopping to get the mining 4x4. (not that i am disapointed i was going to but this there if they had it and it is very rare as of august 2012.) This would be a tuff choice between <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=30151-1"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=30151-1</a>&nbsp;mini dozer</p>
<p><strong>Packing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like the bag except the cover was very disapointing becuase he is mining a parking lot that appers to be abandoned. I do not think this is very atractive and when it is not atractive younger kids like&nbsp; do not like it and turn away to the next lego set to get. but the bright yellow color and dynomight are a great thing to attract kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad quality to small and the colors are a bit hard to tell apart. I do wish they would make them bigger. I am a&nbsp;KFOL so a AFOL will have trouble seeing these instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>a GREAT Way to get the new flat stud peice, dynomight yellow wheels and a jack hammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>A simple but confuisng build. with the instructions hard to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>
<p>ok becuase there is no gold and now boulder. but it does roll nice for a smaller set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hop you liked my review on this smaller set. I know many KFOL reviews are not liked but i try to make mine as best as posible and are sad HUW made it so you can block them but i am glad for AFOLs who trust kfols enought to read there review.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

I expect the scalpers were in force then - which really annoys me. As this is the best set of the bunch in terms of whats included I trudged all the way to my TRU in the cold weather we're having here in the UK to get it - luckily they had them.&nbsp;<br><br>This is definitely a £5 - £6 small set if at proper retail, so this is most certainly the best value purchase of Lego I've made in years.</span>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-07T22:47:12.66Z","Worker Working at the Mine","<p>Set #30152 Mining Quad: The City Polybags from 2012 have been some of the more interesting on offer, even the typical Police and Fire sets have been interesting looking. Nothing however beats these Mining sets, a brand new Sub-Theme that expands on your LEGO City display with some much needed new play patterns and collectibility.</p>
<p>The Mining Quad is slightly better than the Mining Dozer, simply because it offers up more pieces and doesn't waste space with two large parts. However it is still a simple and quick to build little model that isn't much as far as vehicles go. It uses primarily yellow pieces, with some black and dark gray to break it up, there is one of those newer single pieces which has the molded headlights on the front. Some MOCers may feel that this breaks from tradition for LEGO Vehicles, prefering to build on headlights, I say this piece is quite useful and preferable to some of the alternative choices. The model seats one Mini-Figure and stores all of his accessories in the back.</p>
<p>The miner is just a very fun looking Mini-Figure, and quite impressive with the detailing as far as his torso is concerned. He's got a double-sided torso print with a dark blue jacket, a pair of suspenders for holding up his pants and a tool belt with a wrench in a pouch. He's sweating a bit, no doubt it sometimes gets hot while working in that mine, and he has a determined looking facial expression, he's working hard. The pants are a lighter brown color or more than likely tan, and he's got the new mining hat accessory for his headgear. He also includes a jackhammer, a stick of dynamite and two small buildable cones to warn others of the fact that he's there working.</p>
<p>Overall I recommend this Polybag set for some of the useful parts, the cheap way to get some of those new mining hats and also the fun that can be had, it looks great next to the other Polybag set, the Mining Dozer as well as larger mining sets. It might be a bit simple as far as the build is concerned without too many unique steps, however it's a solid set and well worth pursuing.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Leggo_my_LEGO","2012-11-22T06:34:23.63Z","Great bargain, plus hey, its a quad!","<p>I got this set at Toys R Us in Canada, also its November so kind of surprising there. I had planned to get the Octan tanker from 2010 but they didn't have it, so I bought the Fire ATV and the yellow seaplane because on LEGO's website it said it was retiring. A bunch of these little yellow guys were on the end of one of the aisles on those hook things they always have random polybags on top of each other on, and I thought my firefighter needed a friend to have fun with. The quad is a very nice looking yellow, its not as dark and greenish as in the scan on this website, but in real life its not eye barfingly bright either. It also has a nice little area in the back with space for 2 small warning cone thingies, and hooks for some dynamite and a jackhammer. That's a little unsafe, having a jackhammer right beside some dynamite strapped to a quad, don't you think? Anyway, the little space in the back has about 2 more studs of space with the cones in it, so you could put some money in if you want! So thats why Johnny got fired... Back on track though, the only con I can think of is that the front looks a little basic. I'll try to modify it later so that I can put a forwards facing 1x2 headlight on it.</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Nice looking colors</li><li>Mining minifigure isn't wearing any kind of uniform so you could easily re-purpose him</li><li>Dynamite stick, jackhammer, 2 small warning cones and a cool hat</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Front looks a little basic</li></ul><p>If you can find it, you should definitely get this set in my opinion. Its a cheap and easy way to get a nice looking vehicle and you can easily re-purpose the miner and his quad to be an everyday thing if you don't mind his jimmies permanently being rustled (according to his face) and the quad being yellow (according to the rest of the mining theme).</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"tkettle9719","2012-12-25T12:45:44.53Z","Lego Labor, Ltd.","<p>I got this set at Target for my younger cousin as a Christmas gift. However, due to the fact that he had other Lego sets that he had yet to build, I decided to go ahead and keep it. After building it, I can say that I have come to enjoy this set. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigure here is an excellent worker; his sweaty head and the hat that he wears are just excellent little pieces. <br></li><li>The small accessories are also very nice; the drill and the dynamite are excellent and good for play or display. <br></li><li>The car is very simple; sometimes, the best sets are those that are simple and undetailed. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I would have preferred a steering wheel over the handlebars anyday. <br></li><li>I wish that the body were a bit bigger, so as to maybe fit a small door into the set. <br></li><li>I also believe that the red piece in front is a bit out-of-place with the rest of the set. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a nice small set, and it works. I believe that it is a bit too small for my liking, but it looks good still. The minifigure wins me over for some weaknesses in the vehicle itself. I would recommend this as a nice little stocking stuffer for children. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

"CrescentSky","2015-11-07T15:33:19.883Z","A Perfect Example of a Perfect Polybag","<p>I have always been attracted to polybags, as they usually offer an interesting model and are good impulse buys. This set, however, is a shining example of a great polybag. For the price&nbsp;(roughly $4.00), you get more accessories than most related sets.&nbsp;Overall, this set feels like it could have been a larger set on its own.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes as an aforementioned&nbsp;standard polybag. The instructions are in a pamphlet style unlike the usual booklet, though this is most likely to save space. Not much else to say, as the packaging is like all other polybag sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For what it is, this set has some good parts, like the yellow small car fender in the front, or the black bar piece. The dynamite stick is always useful, and the jackhammer is nice too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The one minifigure in this set come in many other mining sets. Although he is nothing special himself, the helmet introduced in this theme is much appreciated. I feel the set included more minifig accessories than it had too, but that isn&#39;t necessarily&nbsp;a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple and quick, but satisfying nonetheless. It makes good utilization of parts and is more like an actual boxed set than a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is a good one, providing a good looking, durable vehicle for play or display. It makes a great accent to all other sets in the subtheme, and is also nice by itself.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It is a great value and is great for anyone who likes the mining&nbsp;subtheme. The playatability&nbsp;is good, and it is overall one of my favorite polybags. Not much else to say about this small set, other than that I completely reccomend it, so buy it if you can.</p>
