"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-21T20:22:50.243Z","Puny human. ","Even as I sit here with this Hulk Minifig in my possession, I am still quite baffled as to what it was exactly to make Hulk the character of choice for inclusion as part of a polybag giveaway. There's no denying that Bruce Banner's alter ego is a wildly popular and marketable character, of course, but it seems especially odd considering that the Hulk debuted in the Helicarrier Breakout set (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6868-1"">6868</a>) in a much more spectacular way and one that is considerably more true to the scale of the recent comics and films, which all depict the Hulk as being significantly larger than a ""regular"" human being. Where all that extra bulk comes from and where it all goes is anybody's guess.<div><br></div><div>The Hulk's increase in size is very much a function of ""power inflation"" that occurs with long-running comic book characters. Superman's debut issue saw him lifting a car over his head as a feat of strength, whereas nowadays the Man of Steel routinely cruises through the universe and punches through planets on a whim. Therefore, perhaps the best way to interpret this particular Hulk Minifig is as a ""classic"" version of the Hulk, perhaps circa the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_(TV_series)"">Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno era</a>. My own evidence for this would be that this version of the Hulk retains his classic stretchy purple underpants, compared to the more, er, ""realistic"" tan that the 2008 and 2012 movies opt for. Unfortunately, the side of the legs are not printed, which is a shame.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The rest of the Minifig is more or less anything that you expect from, well, a Minifig. I'm inclined to say that the hairpiece is a Harry Potter one, while the head is a double-sided one, with one side being angry and the other side being, erm, slightly less angry. Of course, the Hulk is such an iconic character that the Minifig could represent nothing else. I did decide that the Computer Programmer (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8831-14"">8831-14</a>) will play the role of Bruce Banner, so it's a darn good thing that he was released just in time for this exact circumstance.</div><div><br></div><div>So, this is obviously a cool Minifig to have, if only for exclusivity's sake, and given that a slew of new sets have been recently released (at least in the US), there's really no reason to not take advantage now and pick this littler Hulk up for yourself. Still, I don't have answer for (a) what to do with him, considering that I have the ""regular"" Hulk from 6868, and (b) why on God's blue earth did LEGO not consider making a Nick Fury polybag instead? Or Maria Hill? Or War Machine? Or Red Skull? There's no shortage of ""movie famous"" characters that I think would make for awesome Minifigs, but...well, I have no answers. If you do, let me know.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,5

And yes, that is Harry Potter hair, but it adds to his goofy charm.&nbsp;He complements the other Avengers nicely in a comical way as well--it's more entertaining in my opinion to have him be a little angry guy smashing people/things than a big monster.

"The_Reviewer","2012-06-02T21:02:55.11Z","The Hulk in Minifigure form","<p>   &nbsp; I got this with my purchase at the Dowtown Disney lego store and I was glad I didn't miss out on this. But I'am surprised how negative the reviews are for this minifig. First off he has a double sided head with a angry grin and the other is a angry expression where he looks like he's unsure about something. He also has backprinting that shows he has muscles on his back.&nbsp;The hair is the same as Harry Potter's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Despite this is made in China, it is still a good minifigure and is a great addition to your collection and a must-have if your a big fan of Hulk or the whole Marvel Superheroes series.You can find this on Ebay/Amazon.&nbsp; Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,2,5

"IanRohan","2014-03-06T03:30:28.463Z","Run! Dr. Banner's turning green and... shrinking into a Lego minifigure?","<p>I received this set as a free promotion with my first Lord of the Rings sets. Although Hulk was initially eclipsed by Gandalf, Shelob, an army of Uruk-hai, and the new horse design, I eventually realized I had something special on my hands...</p>

<p>Box and Instructions - Simple. This is a polybag with no instructions in sight.</p>

<p>Parts - One receives four parts here: Harry Potter&#39;s hair (which Hulk&nbsp;actually wears better&nbsp;than Harry, in my opinion); a double-sided head, with one side displaying a growling, perturbed expression, and the other showing full-on rage; a torso printed with the&nbsp;typical beefed-up superhero&nbsp;musculature on the front and a few lines&nbsp;depicting Hulk&#39;s spine&nbsp;on the back; and legs, which are sadly not&nbsp;printed&nbsp;purple on the tops or sides.</p>

<p>The Build - Depending on your level of Lego expertise, this may take anywhere from one to three seconds to build, presenting no challenge whatsoever. Side effects may include sarcasm about the building time.</p>

<p>Completed Model - I have to admit I was initially hesitant about Hulk&#39;s lack of scale to his fellow Avengers as well as his interesting color choice in clothing. Being the type that researches&nbsp;whatever I come across, I brushed up on my Marvel history and - lo and behold! - the original Hulk to join the Avengers in 1963 was little taller than his fellow heroes and was indeed clothed in purple. Thus, despite the polybag&#39;s obvious depiction of Hulk rampaging through post-Loki New York, I believe this minifigure actually&nbsp;represents the 1960s Hulk; this would make him one of&nbsp;the oldest versions of any Marvel character to be accurately depicted in Lego.&nbsp;Team him up with 76017&#39;s Captain America&nbsp;and 76018&#39;s&nbsp;Thor and you&#39;ll have most of a&nbsp;classic Avengers team.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that, I think, makes him pretty special.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion - So the question is: are you willing to pay the high price on eBay or elsewhere for this one minifigure? That depends on why you want him. If you&#39;re a kid looking to build a team of Avengers to save your bedroom from Loki, there&#39;s nothing for you here; the big Hulk figure smashes better and offers&nbsp;a much superior play experience. If you&#39;re a Marvel fan wanting to collect Lego versions of your favorite characters, this is for you! It&#39;s the classic Hulk! If you&#39;re simply a minifigure enthusiast looking to expand your collection, you can&#39;t help but admit that it&#39;s hilarious to see&nbsp;everyone&#39;s favorite enormous green rage&nbsp;monster shrunk into a little&nbsp;plastic Lego person.</p>

"Professor_X","2015-10-13T20:49:27.39Z","""HULK STRONGEST ONE THERE IS!!!!!""","<p>&nbsp; Three years ago, I bought Helms Deep from the the Lord of the Rings theme(best-day-ever) and I was surprised&nbsp;when the LEGO Store employee put a tiny Hulk minifigure in my bag. While&nbsp;I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t&nbsp;get ruined as at the time as I had no idea what I had, This little Hulk is actually a lot better than I anticipated and it&#39;s grown on me over the years. Is this hulk a must-have collectible, or is he just another strange variation on a popular character. Read on to see...&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Completed Minifigure:</p>

<p>&nbsp; I was having a hard time trying to pin point what version of The Hulk this minifigure is based on. My conclusion is that he&#39;s based on The Hulk from the 80&#39;s tv show, but he could be based on the&nbsp;not-so colossal sized hulk from the early 60&#39;s comics. Whatever the case, this Hulk minifgure is very well designed. His purple pants are printed with great stitching and rip marks. The only oddity here is the lack of printing on the side of Hulk&#39;s legs. His torso is printed with a simple muscle design on the back and front, while his head&nbsp;is contorted in one of the greatest angry faces in minifigure history. The other side of Hulk&#39;s head is printed with a much less intimidating sneer, and while many people have complained about the use of Harry Potter hair for this minifgiure, it&nbsp;recreates the tv Hulk&#39;s hair-style pretty well, further proving of my theory.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you were able to get this minifgure at the time it was released, I hope you kept it in good shape! With an average minimum asking price of $40.00 CA/$31.00 US(Sorry die-hard Hulk fans, I feel your pain!), this minifigure is currently the most expensive Super Hero shop exclusive. I personally think there are many more interesting Super Hero minifigures&nbsp;to choose from that cost much less money, but I leave you and your wallet to decide whether you should buy this one.</p>
