"CapnRex101","2012-07-23T16:38:12.693Z","8909 (1) - Brawny Boxer","<p>Over the years Great Britain has yielded many great boxers, from Henry Cooper to Joe Calzaghe, boxing has been one of the sports we have had the greatest success in. Therefore it is no surprise that Lego have produced a boxer as one of the nine Olympic Minifigures that they have released in the UK to coincide with the 2012 London Olympics. This Minifigure is similar to the red boxer released in Series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures but this time it is predominantly blue as he is a member of the Team GB Olympic squad which allows one to set up bouts between the red boxer, and this blue one. This is in fact one of my favourite Minifigures from this selection due to the outstanding parts, and even better playability!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start at the top as usual, with the blue head guard. This piece is exactly the same shape as the red one with the boxer from Series 5, but on this occasion it is printed with a white panel and the Team GB logo, a stylised lion's head in the British colours of red and white. I like this mould very much and in blue it looks wonderful, the printed detail is a nice addition and makes the component &nbsp;little more interesting and accurate to what is actually worn at the Olympics.</p><p>Next is the nice head piece which is sadly printed on only one side unlike the older boxer figure, which featured a battered and bruised face on the reverse side which was excellent. Nevertheless, this face features some black eyebrows and a grinning expression with a light blue gum shield visible in his mouth, which is sufficient in my opinion.</p><p>He wears a gold medal with a red strap, which is a nice inclusion, albeit optimistic! This is exactly the same piece as features with the Swimming Champion from Series 7 of the Collectable Minifigures and all of the rest of these superb Olympic Minifigures. The piece fits nicely around his neck but unfortunately prevents the head guard from sitting right down in the correct position on his head. This is unavoidable sadly, but it does not really effect the appearance of the figure anyway for display.</p><p>The torso is mostly blue and features some muscle definition, a small white Team GB logo, and a thick white belt which has a central buckle with the letters 'GB' written on it. Some elastic detail is printed on the piece and there are a few folds in the fabric of his shirt. His arms are bare and therefore yellow in colour, and his hands are unique. They are the same mould as the boxer from Series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures, but this time in blue. I very much like these glove parts and they look very realistic indeed.</p><p>The legs are nice too, with some white printing on the blue hips, which is continued on to his blue legs. He is wearing blue shorts and white shoes with a small area of yellow skin visible between the two items of clothing. There are also some creases in these shorts which is a nice detail making them look a little more authentic.</p><p>I usually ignore the base included with all Collectable Minifigures, but this one is not the standard plain black. It features the Olympic Rings, the Team GB logo, and the words 'Team GB' printed on this white base which certainly compliments the figure more than a standard black base for display and&nbsp;differentiates&nbsp;these Minifigures from the more mainstream Minifigures.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is one of the Minifigures I recommend most highly from this Olympic selection, not only as it looks so outstanding, but also because there is a lot of potential playability if you are in possession of the red boxer from Series 5 which is great.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

I paid $7 for this and think that it was worth is since I am in the US. They had all the figures from this series and even had the box with it. If you ever go there on they have any of these get this one.",FALSE,5,5,1,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-06T15:01:32.957Z","surprisingly GREAT!!!","<p>The first figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Brawny Boxer. He was released in 2012, was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, was made to coincide with the 2012 Olympics, retailed for 2 Euro, and finally, includes 6 pieces. Keep in mind, this figure costed Euro, and not money, as money is an American currency and this figure was not sold in America. But anyway, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that boxing helmet, which is a recolour of the boing helmet from Series 5. I actually like seeing it in blue more than the original red colour, and I also like just how bulky the helmet is, and how rounded it is at the sides. The printing on front of it has some really complex printing, with that Team GB logo, being the red and blue lion, printed on that white background.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which has a great expression. I like that big smile he has, and I like that blue mouthpiece as well. I will say that besides the colour of the mouthpiece, that face is almost identical to the Series 5 Boxer. I wish we could&#39;ve maybe a more unique face that differentiates this and the Series 5 Boxer, but it is what it is I guess. No alternate face on this figure, which I suppose is a key difference from the Series 5 Boxer.</p>

<p>I suppose the next thing to discuss would be that medal, which was new to the series before this, which was Series 7. Of course, it isn&#39;t that special nowadays, but again, it was pretty uncommon and hard to get back then, so it&#39;s great seeing it here. That round, gold part is printed, and I like how the rest of it is red.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms, both of which have some great detail. The torso itself has that great blue colour, with the dark red around the collar, and I love that white Team GB logo on the chest. That white belt has lots of great detail as well, with all the scales, and even that GB plaque in the centre. I like how is arms are plain yellow, but of course, those boxing gloves are the show-stealers. They are just recolours of the boxing gloves from Series 5, but in this blue colour, they are exclusive. I love how round they are, and how the thumbs are moulded in as well. Unfortunately, he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his legs, and I love the printing on them. The red and white lines going straight down the legs look great, as do all the many wrinkles. I like how the yellow flesh is printed towards the bottom, and the side leg printing on this guy is really amazing as well, to where the blue on the sides is all printed. I&#39;m actually really impressed by the leg detail on this figure.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, the Team GB Series is by far my least favourite series. This figure, however, is by far my favourite of the series, and I actually really love this design. Sure, it&#39;s basically a recolour of the Series 5 Boxer, but I like the blue colour on this guy better than the red on the Series 5 one. Also, the printing on this guy is much more advanced than the printing on the Series 5 Boxer. So in the end, for two Euro (basically three dollars in American terms,) this figure is pretty great! I just wanna say though, the price of this guy in Ebay is absolutely ridiculous nowadays, so if you wanna order him or import him, beware.</p>

<p>But that is it for this long review, so thanks for reading!</p>
