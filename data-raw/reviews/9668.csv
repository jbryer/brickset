"CapnRex101","2012-07-25T17:27:22.34Z","8909 (2) - Stealth Swimmer","<p>The Stealth Swimmer is the surprise package of the Olympic Minifigure collection in my opinion as I was not holding out much hope for it prior to the release, but now it has become a favourite of mine from this series. Swimming is a sport which is often an opportunity for Team GB to pick up a few medals, in both the Olympic and Paralympic games, making this a very suitable choice of sport on the part of Lego.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The swimming cap is my favourite part of the figure, it is not a new mould as it was introduced with the Swimming Champion from Series 7 of the Collectable Minifigures. However on this occasion, the piece is cast in white and is in fact printed with a Team GB logo on either side of the cap in the glorious British red and blue colours! This is a wonderful piece and features some moulded detailing of creases in the rubbery material which swimming caps are made from. This is a delightful little touch and one which I appreciate very much as it significantly contributes to the realism of the component.</p><p>The head piece too is nice with black eyebrows, a smiling expression and a pair of swimming goggles which all look great. There are a couple of light blue droplets of water printed on his forehead which is a very neat touch adding that little bit of extra detail.</p><p>The medal hanging around the swimmer's neck is fantastic. It is cast in red for the strap and the medal itself is printed in metallic gold. This piece was originally seen with the previous incarnation of a swimmer just like the swimming cap and is also included with every single one of the nine Olympic Minifigures released this summer. The part fits around the neck of a Minifigure and looks outstanding on this character, helping to break up the mostly yellow colour scheme as much of his skin is visible.&nbsp;</p><p>Th torso piece is almost entirely yellow but printed with some muscles as his chest is bare. The arms and hands are yellow as well and there is no back printing. A few pieces have been seen much like this one before but what really sets this one apart are the droplets of water which are running down his chest, just like on his head.</p><p>The hips and legs are printed too with blue swimming trunks, as well as two small red and white stripes. Beneath that is more yellow skin, again with some water droplets printed on them to complete the Minifigure.</p><p>The base is cast in white and printed with the Olympic Rings and a Team GB logo. This sets the Minifigure apart from most and I am pleased that the designers chose to create a printed base to display the Minifigure on for the Olympic collection.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Although this is not my favourite of all these Olympic Minifigures, this is the most surprising one for me having seen the original images and it is really excellent. This is a figure I would highly recommend and one which I would award...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 9/10</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

<p>The base is exclusive to this series. His hat is pretty the same as the one in series 7. But it is white with the team GB logo. The face has some goggles. He has a gold medal around his neck. The torso is normal with the muscle. His legs have some blue shorts. Also he has the wet on him.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-06T17:50:35.977Z","I'm a bit ashamed, but I LIKE this!!!","<p>The second swimmer found in the LEGO Minifigures Series Team GB Series is the Stealth Swimmer. He was released in 2012,&nbsp;retailed for 2 Euro, (3 dollars in American standards,) was only available in the United Kingdom and some parts of Europe to coincide with the Olympics, and lastly, includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that white swimming hat, which funny enough, that piece was originally introduced in the Series 7 Swimming Champion. It&#39;s caste in a new colour here, being that white colour, and I love just how smooth it is, with very little wrinkles. The printing on it is pretty fantastic as well, with the red and blue lion logo, which is surprisingly printed on both sides. I think that hat is my favourite&nbsp;part of this whole figure!</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has a really nice expression. I love those blue goggles, and I like how the face looks a bit aged, with those precise cheekbones and all. I like that small smirk as well. No alternate expression is included.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which I love the printing on it. I love the muscles, with the six packs and all, and one of my favourite details is the drips on him. They&#39;re supposed to represent pool water I suppose, but it could also be used for a sweating torso, which is how I would prefer to use it. This figure has no back printing, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, and I love how that top section is caste in blue. I also really love the printing on it, with those red and white stripes. I also love the printing on the two lower sections of the legs, with how the blue matches up so perfectly with the upper leg piece. I also really love how the red and white lines continue to the legs, and how he has more of those water drops on him, which again, could be used for a sweaty print.</p>

<p>Now I wanna point out that this figure includes a medal piece that was first introduced in Series 7, so it was a pretty uncommon piece back in the day. For some reason it isn&#39;t included in the image here on Brickset, so you&#39;ll just have to take my word for it. I like the gold printing on that medal piece as well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, I actually do kind of like this figure. I&#39;m a bit impressed by the printing on all the pieces included, and something I forgot to point out with my last Team GB minifigure review is that the display plate included is caste in white, and includes some shiny silver printing. I like how that baseplate is included in every figure in this series as well. But anyway, I used to hate this series, and I never really liked this figure. I must say, though... this is not a bad figure whatsoever. So I&#39;m actually gonna give him a solid 4 out of 5. That&#39;s basically it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
