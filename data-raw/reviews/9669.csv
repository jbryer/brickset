"CapnRex101","2012-07-25T10:56:57.503Z","8909 (3) - Relay Runner","<p>The Relay Runner was one of the Minifigures I was least enthusiastic about before the release of this selection, but now that I have it I am pleasantly surprised. This Minifigure is highly detailed and although no brand new pieces are included, the printing and colour choices for each part are superb and really contribute to a very solid figure. Anyway, On with the review...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair piece included with the Relay Runner is the same mould as the piece introduced with the Sleepyhead from Series 6 of the Collectable Minifigures, but this time it is cast in a much darker shade of brown which is a nice change. His hair is unkempt and spiky which is nice and suits the character very nicely indeed.</p><p>The head is decent, featuring brown eyebrows and a confident smirk, as well as a couple of beads of sweat which is a lovely detail. However, this is similar to what we have seen before and is far from revolutionary! All in all, not a bad piece, but not a highlight either.</p><p>The gold medal is a great inclusion featuring a red strap and metallic gold medallion which looks quite realistic. The part fits around the neck of the Minifigure and unlike most pieces around the neck, does not raise the height of the head piece off the shoulders which keeps the Minifigure looking a bit more natural. Occasionally neck attachments can cause a figure to look abnormally tall so it is nice that a solution was found to avoid this. The component is identical to the one which comes with the Swimming Champion from Series 7 of the Collectable Minifigures.</p><p>The torso is my favourite piece as it is superbly detailed and features a nice reference to the last time London held the Olympic Games, 1948, which here is displayed on his chest as the Relay Runner's number. I think this is a great touch from Lego and one which I was rather impressed with. The vest printed on the torso is split in to two colours, red and white. The top half is red with a small white Team GB logo found here and some white trim. The red area of the running vest is printed with some creasing and the running number on a blue panel. His yellow skin is visible around his neck and arms on the torso, and his hands and arms are plain yellow. There is sadly no back printing, but this does not take away from the Minifigure too much in my opinion.</p><p>The legs and hips too are printed with his blue running shorts. The hips have an elastic pattern on them which is a nice addition. Down the sides of his legs a pair of white stripes are present which look lovely and on the front are some red stripes and creasing in the fabric. White shoes are printed on the feet of the Relay Runner and between the shoes and his shorts is an area of yellow skin.</p><p>One accessory is carried by this figure and that is of course a relay baton. The baton makes use of a pearl grey 3L rod which looks just fine.</p><p>The base which the Minifigure can be displayed on is white and printed with the Team GB logo and the Olympic Rings which makes a nice change from the plain black stand seen with the standard Collectable Minifigures.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a figure which fades in to obscurity in this series of Olympic Minifigures in my opinion. It is a good figure, but has no particularly outstanding features so while I would recommend it, there are other figures out there superior to this one.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-06T22:56:40.953Z","NOT BAD at ALL!","<p>The third figure in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Relay Runner. He was released in 2012, was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, retailed for 2 Euro (3 dollars in American standards,) and finally, he includes 7 pieces. Before we begin I wanna say that he, along with every other figure in the series, includes a fantastic white display plate with some great silver printing on it, so keep that in mind. Anyway, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off this figure, we have that spiky hair piece, which is caste in dark brown. That hair piece in that colour was new foe the figure, and it looks fantastic. It does fit the figure for some reason, and I like the very complex moulding all over it.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has some fantastic printing on it. I love his smile, but my favourite part of the head is the sweat drips, as they&#39;re extremely useful outside the setting. I also like the smaller details, like the little crease next to the mouth. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features some really great printing. There&#39;s so much amazing detail in it, with the red on top and the white on bottom. I also love the yellow flesh, which has some muscle printing on it as well. That muscle shirt itself has some great detail, with that small Team GB logo, and also that &quot;Team Gb 1948&quot; plaque on the white section of it. I love his exposed yellow arms, but this figure has no back torso printing, which is pretty disappointing to me, especially since that muscle shirt looks totally missing from the back.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have lots of great printing. I love the white on the bottom, and how it progresses to the yellow flesh on the front and sides, The blue on the front and sides is all printed, which is pretty impressive, and the wrinkles on front is great. The side printing remains equally impressive, with the two white lines. I love the detail on that upper leg piece, with how the red lines that continue from bottom to top, and there&#39;s even some detail between the red lines.</p>

<p>And his accessory, while it is extraordinarily fitting, isn&#39;t anything too special, as it is just a plain, small, light grey pole. I actually like seeing it in that colour though, and I do like getting that smaller pole design as well. This figure actually has another accessory as well, being a medal, which for some reason isn&#39;t in the image here on Brickset.&nbsp;It isn&#39;t anything that special, as it is included in every Team GB CMF, and is a pretty easy to get piece nowadays in general. I still like the piece, though, and I like how LEGO actually included it. It features some gold printing, and the red section can fit around the figures neck very easily.</p>

<p>That is it for the figure! Overall, I used to hate the Team GB Series. But I will say, this is my third Team GB CMF review, and this series really isn&#39;t that bad. This figure in particular isn&#39;t one of my favourites, but even he has some impressive printing, especially on the head and legs. Plus, that new hair piece was an excellent inclusion. SO in the end, I&#39;m going to be giving this figure a 4 out of 5. That&#39;s all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
