"CapnRex101","2012-07-27T02:04:17.32Z","8909 (4) - Judo Fighter","<p>The Judo Fighter was one of the figures I expected little of due to the apparent similarity of this Minifigure to the Karate Master from Series 2 of the Collectable Minifigures. However now that I have it I can safely say that I am pleased with this Minifigure. It is not by any means an absolute must have, but it is far better than I had expected.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair piece is quite plain but actually rather useful and very suited to this Minifigure. It is the standard short ponytail mould which has been around since the first series of the Collectable Minifigures and has appeared in just about every possible hair colour. However the piece had never appeared in plain black until now which I have found a delight as I finally have some suitable hair for Catwoman without her mask on in the DC Super Heroes theme! It looks great on that Minifigure, but also is entirely appropriate for this figure as the hair is neatly tied back out of the way for when this Judo competitor is fighting.</p><p>The face is fine, very simple, but it nevertheless conveys her expression and adds to the relatively low number of female head piece for use in themes such as Lego City. This one is printed with black eyebrows, eyelashes, and a confident smile with a bit of lipstick around it. There is no printing on the other side of the head so like every other figure from this selection, the head is only one sided.</p><p>The medal included is nice, coming with all nine of these Minifigures. The strap which slides around the neck of the figure is red and the medallion is metallic gold. I would have liked to see a bit of variation in the colours so we could have gold, silver, and bronze medals, but perhaps the Lego company were a little too optimistic about Team GB's chances at these Olympic Games. The figure looks equally good with or without the medal and it does not interfere with her head at all like some neck attachments which raise the height of the head on the shoulders of a figure, making them look a little awkward sometimes.</p><p>The torso is quite simple as well but accurately recreates the white Judo uniform and looks great in my opinion. Often in past Olympic Games the Great British Judo athletes have worn blue outfits, but this white colour looks superb and I think it is perfect. A nice dotted edging pattern is found around the edges of the garment she is wearing which looks good and a small Team GB logo is visible on her chest. A bit of bare skin is visible at the top and most of her black belt is printed at the bottom of the piece. We get plenty of creases in the fabric and the feminine curves which appear on just about every female Minifigure. This figure is unique in this series as it is the only one to feature any back printing which includes some more of the black belt and a much larger Team GB logo. The arms are plain white and the hands are yellow.</p><p>The white legs and hips have a very small amount of printing on them. Some more of her black belt runs across the hips in two places and this is continued on to her legs. These are the hanging tassels from where it has been tied around her waist and this is very&nbsp;reminiscent&nbsp;indeed of the Karate Master Minifigure which shared a similar design.</p><p>A white base is included like every other Olympic Collectable Minifigure, but I am glad Lego elected to create a special stand for these fantastic Minifigures rather than reuse the plain black one again. The Team GB logo and Olympic rings are printed on here in blue and this variation in the design sets these Minifigures apart from the more common Collectable Minifigures in every other series.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a figure which has surpassed my expectations, but despite this, when compared to other figures from this group I find myself less impressed with this one than with many others. However the playability is good, especially if you either have another of the same Minifigure for this one to fight, or the Karate Master from Series 2, which can probably pass for a Judo team member if you wish.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-11T21:48:21.317Z","she's OKAY, but not super NEW!","<p>The fourth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Judo Fighter. She was released in 2012, retailed for 2 Euro, (basically 3 bucks in American dollars,) was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, and lastly, she includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that ponytail hair piece. Back in about 2010, it was a pretty hard to get hair piece. By 2012 it had become a bit more common, and of course, nowadays, it&#39;s terribly overused. But still, back in 2012, it was a good piece, and getting it in this black colour was sort of hard to get. I actually still like this hair piece, even in today&#39;s time, and I think it fits this figure extremely well. It has some nice moulding as well, so that it doesn&#39;t feel too outdated, but it isn&#39;t too detailed either, which is great. And again, I love seeing it in black, as it isn&#39;t the most common colouring for it.</p>

<p>Next is her head, which is okay. Nothing too special going on with it, but I like that it&#39;s useful outside this setting. To be honest, this picture here on Brickset is a bit inaccurate, because the real face print has a lot more detail than this. Still, the real print isn&#39;t anything too special. She has no alternate expression, either.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which is very interesting indeed. Before we talk about the thing I&#39;m interested in the most, I wanna say that the detail on the torso is pretty great for the most part. I love the sticking along the seams of the robe, and I&#39;m impressed by that tiny, red and blue, Team GB logo on her chest. Moving down the torso, she has an excellent belt design, with that knot in the middle, and I like the curve lines as well. But my problem with this, is that it looks a bit too similar to the Series 2 Karate Master&#39;s torso, which featured a black and white colour scheme as well. Basically, the only differences are the Team Gb logo, and the curve lines. I mean I like how you can have two different Karate figures, mostly for MOC reasons, but the figures are so tinily different that it&rsquo;s hard&nbsp;to differentiate them without a close examination. However,&nbsp;the Series 2 Karate Master had no back printing, which brings me to my favourite part of the Judo Fighter&#39;s torso: the amazing back torso printing. This figure is one of the few in the series to even have back torso detail, and heck, not any CMF&#39;s in general had back torso printing until this point. For that matter, not many in this SERIES had back torso detail, so it&#39;s great to see it here. The printing on her back is this huge, black Team GB lion logo, as well as more curve lines, and the back of the black belt is printed as well. Anyway, when I look at this practical book of a paragraph I&#39;ve written about the torso, I can tell I&#39;m rambling like crazy. So let&#39;s move on to the legs.</p>

<p>The legs actually have some slight printing, which is the tips of that black belt. I love how seamlessly they go from the torso to the legs, and how they printed it on all 3 pieces of the legs. However, this suffers from the same situation as the torso, to an even greater extent, which is that the leg printing is dangerously similar to the Series 2 Karate Master&#39;s leg printing. Only small difference is that the Karate Masters legs had straight, black belt tips, while this figure has curved, black belt tips. Like I said with the torso, it&#39;s such a small difference that it takes a&nbsp; sharp eye to spot, but I guess I should be grateful that she has leg printing at all!</p>

<p>At this point, I feel like I should apologise for my rambling. Anyway, jokes aside, she includes one accessory that isn&#39;t even included Brickset&#39;s image, which is just a medal piece. It isn&#39;t anything special, as every figure in this series includes one, but I still like the piece, especially since it was a bit uncommon back then. It features some&nbsp;gold printing on the circular part of the medal, while the string part of it is caste in red.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, this figure is basically a gender swap of the Series 2 Karate Master, with slight details that make it a Team GB themed figure. Whether that&#39;s good or bad is up to you. Personally, I like how LEGO managed to make all these pieces exclusive, but I do wish they could&#39;ve possibly made the black details into a dark grey colour to further differentiate it, attire wise. Aside from that, I do like the printing on this figure, with the fantastic back torso&nbsp;detail, and quite frankly, the fantastic front torso printing, too! But in the end, this figure doesn&#39;t feel very fresh and original, therefore I will only be giving it a 3 out of 5. At last, that&#39;s it for this review! Sorry for my rambling on, as I tend to get a bit carried on with these reviews. Thank you for reading!</p>
