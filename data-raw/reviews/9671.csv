"CapnRex101","2012-07-28T07:25:31.187Z","8909 (5) - Tactical Tennis Player","<p>In my opinion the Tactical Tennis Player is probably the weakest of this selection of Olympic Minifigures. Not only is the detail on the figure distinctly average and not particularly impressive, but of course tennis players have been released twice before, and both of those are at least as good as this Minifigure if not better. However, the fact that other players have been released means that there is a fair amount of playability to be had with this figure and that increases its appeal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The hair piece is not new at all but is nevertheless very nice indeed. It has previously been used for Robin in the Super Heroes theme, the Computer Programmer in the Collectable Minifigures series, and the Dino theme as well in this colour making it far from a rare piece. However as already mentioned, this piece looks superb with the hair combed sideways and some texture, and the piece suits the character as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The head print is quite similar to some we have already seen with black eyebrows, cheek definition, and a toothy grin. Quite simple, but again suitable for this sportsman.</p><p>The gold medal piece is wonderful, but is included with every one of these Olympic Minifigures and therefore somehow seems a little less special. A red strap supports the metallic golden medallion which looks fantastic and slides nicely around his neck without raising the head off the shoulders, and therefore not making the figure look at all awkward like some neck attachments do thankfully.</p><p>The torso has a good amount of printing with an open collar, some tiny buttons, blue striping, and a Team GB logo on his chest. I like the collar and buttons in particular as they look very realistic. The arms are white, the hands are yellow, and there is no back printing.</p><p>The hips and legs are both printed very simply indeed. A couple of blue stripes run down across the hips and then on to the legs and a small area of yellow is printed to create shorts and trainers on the figure which looks good. I would have liked to see a bit more detail here though, perhaps another Team GB logo or something like that.</p><p>The Tactical Tennis Player carries a single accessory, which is of course a tennis racquet. This piece has appeared with each of the other two tennis players, but never before in this metallic silver colour which is outstanding. I like this silver cast best of all and the strings look very realistic indeed for such a small piece. For me, this part is the most compelling reason to purchase this Minifigure other than for completion of the series.</p><p>A white base is included with the Olympic rings and a Team GB logo printed on it like every other Olympic Minifigure, however, the stand is very attractive and I am delighted that the simple black base has not been reused for these figures.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This figure is, in my opinion, the least desirable of all of these Olympic Minifigures and is really only one for the tennis fans or those looking to complete their collection. Therefore I would only really recommend it if you are among either of those groups. The beautiful silver tennis racquet and potential for playability raises my score however resulting in...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 6/10</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,5

"sideswinger","2021-05-12T15:23:23.037Z","relatively BORING!","<p>The fifth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Tactical Tennis Player. He was released in 2012, retailed for 2 Euro (basically 3 bucks in US terms), was only released in the UK and some parts of Europe, and includes 7 pieces. So lets take qa closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that smooth black hair piece. I think that piece really fits the figure, and I&#39;ve always loved how smooth it is, with so little moulded detail, but enough detail that it doesn&#39;t feel boring. And even though it is pretty common, I like seeing it in black.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which features some pretty fantastic painting. I love his smile, with those bushy eyebrows above the eyes, and like the added cheek bones as well. Of course, one of my favourite details is the many sweat drips on his face, which makes the head piece really useful outside the setting. It is a bit strange that the drips are a solid white colour, because if his sweat is white, he might need to see the Series 1 Doctor figure! But jokes aside, it&#39;s a pretty good print.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which has a really nice, generic tennis player shirt. I love the red and blue stripes towards the bottom, and I love the buttons around the collar. Speaking of which, the collar itself has a great red colouring with even more red and blue lines beneath it. I like how that yellow flesh is peaking out from under the shirt as well. He has no back torso printing, which is pretty unfortunate, as I think LEGO could&#39;ve elaborated on the red and blue stripes. Also, I forgot&nbsp;to mention, I like the red and blue lin logo on his chest. But nonetheless, let&#39;s move on.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some really great printing. He has some nice, thin blue lines on the edges,&nbsp;and I like how they cut off at the yellow flesh, which carries on to the side of the figure as well.</p>

<p>This figure actually includes not one, but two accessories, one of which is a medal piece. It isn&#39;t included in Brickset&#39;s picture, so you&#39;ll just have to take my word for it. The medal itself is nothing that special, as it is included i every figure of the series; however, it was a bit uncommon back in 2012. It has some nice gold printing on the circular part, and I like that the rest of it is just plain red. His second accessory is that tennis racquet, which I believe this was a new colouring for the piece back when this released. The racquet, being that dark grey colour, has some fantastic moulded detail for all the holes, and there&#39;s even some detail on the handle.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, Team GB has always been my least favourite series; however, I&#39;ve recently reviewed the previous 4 figures in the series, and I was pretty impressed by them, which raised my expectations that I would come to appreciate this figure as well. But to be honest, ever since I&#39;ve seen this figure, I just haven&#39;t been crazy about him, and my opinion actually still stands. Sure, he has some decent parts and prints, but Series 3 and Series 7 both had tennis player figures, so I&#39;m a bit tired of the trope. Of course, that&#39;s more Team GB&#39;s fault than LEGO&#39;s, since tennis is one of the main sport5s for Team GB. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact: this figure is just relatively boring, no offence. So in the end, that tennis racquet does bump p the rating from a 1 to a 2, so I&#39;m gonna give this figure s 2 out of 5. But I apologise again, like I have in all my other words, solely because I&#39;m aimlessly rambling at this point. So all jokes aside, thank you for reading!</p>
