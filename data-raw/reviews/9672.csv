"CapnRex101","2012-07-28T18:10:46.42Z","8909 (6) - Flexible Gymnast","<p>For me the Flexible Gymnast is the absolute shock of this series of Olympic Minifigures. I expected very little of this figure following the release of the first images and dismissed it as one of the weakest of the lot. Now however I am astonished, without a doubt this is my favourite of them all along with the Boxer, due to the components that make it up, the detail on each piece, and the playability of this Minifigure, I think this is a real must have for anybody who is even vaguely interested in the Olympic Games.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Much like the Judo Fighter, this Minifigure too includes the short ponytail hair piece in a brand new and exclusive colour, on this occasion, blonde. It looks excellent in this colour, better than any other in my opinion, and is suited to this Minifigure perfectly featuring some moulded texture which increases the realism of the piece.</p><p>The head too is great with a nice, albeit simple, bit of printing. The gymnast has very thin black eyebrows, eyelashes and a big grin with some lipstick. This is a fairly standard female face but it looks superb despite its simplicity and is ideal for this character in my opinion.</p><p>Just like the other Olympic Minifigures and the Swimming Champion from Series 7 of the Collectable Minifigures a gold medal is included with this figure which I am pleased with. The red strap slides comfortably and easily around her neck without raising the head off the shoulders like some neck attachments do. The medallion itself is metallic gold in colour which is optimistic for Team GB's chances!</p><p>The torso is my favourite component however, it features a section of a very large blue and red Team GB logo which is continued on the legs. Around her neck is some bare skin and her leotard looks realistic with a bit of blue around the shoulders and red around the collar. The standard feminine curves are printed on the torso as one would expect. The arms are blue and the hands are yellow as they are bare, there is no back printing.</p><p>The hips and legs are both printed with a continuation of the fantastic Team GB lion's head logo, which I think looks excellent (far better than the logo for the entire London 2012 Olympic Games). Most of her legs are yellow however as they are bare like her hands just like most real female gymnasts.</p><p>Included with the Minifigure is a simple balance beam which consists of two white one by one bricks and a tan coloured four by one plate. It is very simplistic but is a lovely thing to have included and one which was not really a necessity, so I am delighted that we have in fact been given a beam for her.</p><p>The stand included for the figure is the exact same mould as every Collectable Minifigure base but on this occasion it is cast in white and printed with the Team GB logo and the famous Olympic rings in light blue. I am glad that a unique base was included for these Olympic themed Minifigures as it sets them apart from the rest of the Collectable Minifigures and makes them a little more special.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I was really surprised when I got this Minifigure and I think you will be too (unless you tipped it as a favourite unlike me in which case your expectations will be met!) I would recommend it to anybody and if you are based outside of the UK and are a sports fan, I would advise you to purchase them all if you can from one of the many sellers of these fantastic Minifigures. There are some good prices out there, and many fellow Lego fans who do not aim to profit from selling the figures overseas, but simply wish to help out in the wider Lego community around the world. However, if you really can only get one, it is your choice between this and the Boxer I think, as I cannot choose between them. As you may have expected I am of course going to award this marvellous Minifigure with...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

<p>The hair is in yellow. It has a nice smile. It has a gold medal around its neck. The torso has a big team GB logo, the logo carrys onto the legs.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-14T21:13:31.833Z","a pretty BAD figure!","<p>The sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Flexible Gymnast. She was released in 2012, retailed for 2 Euro (which is basically 3 bucks in American terms), was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, and includes 9 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So we&#39;re going to start with the figure first, and then move on to his accessory; the first part of the figure is, of course, that pony-tail hair, caste in the bright, spring yellow colour. While that piece isn&#39;t necessarily very important, it seems to fit the figure pretty well. That piece was introduced in around 2008-2009, but wasn&#39;t quite as common in 2012 as it is nowadays. The colouring, being that bright yellow, isn&#39;t super common, and was even rarer back in the day of this release, so it&#39;s great to get here. The moulding, while nothing revolutionary or amazing, doesn&#39;t seem underdone, and I like the wavy details on the pony-tail, the front, and even the top. However, as much as I like the colour it&#39;s caste in, it kind of clashes with the head, since it&#39;s a darker yellow tone. But it&#39;s not too big of a deal.</p>

<p>Next is her head piece, which features a unique face, though it&#39;s nothing too special, to be frank. I like her chipper smile, as well as the small crease beside the mouth, and the miniscule eyelashes are a nice touch as well. She has no back facial printing, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features some fantastic printing! I love that huge red and blue Team GB lion, which covers a large portion of the torso, and she even has those dark grey curve lines at the sides. I like how her arms are completely blue, with the yellow, flesh hands. What stinks&nbsp;is that even though her front torso has great detail, the back of her torso is completely sparse, and features absolutely no printing whatsoever, which is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have very little, but still some printing, most of which is on that upper leg piece. I love how the red and blue lines carry on from the lion really seamlessly, and how the white on the two lower pieces match up as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, she has two accessories, the first of which is a medal. The medal is not included in Brickset&#39;s picture, though, so you&#39;ll just have to take my word for it. The medal isn&#39;t too special, as it is included in every figure of the series, but it was uncommon back then as well, being new to the series directly before this, that being Series 7. The piece itself looks good, with the round, gold printing, and I like the red for the necklace part of it. Then her second accessory is that build, which is made up of 3 pieces: two 1x1&#39;s, and the 1x4 plate. I like how that looks, though I wish it was a tile instead of a plate, as that would look more realistic. I like how that build is included, but I don&#39;t like how the minifigure can&#39;t even actually grab it, like shown in the picture. Don&#39;t be fooled by that image; she can&#39;t grab a stud like that with her hand.</p>

<p>Either way, that is it for the figure! Overall, this is actually my least favourite in the series overall, as she just doesn&#39;t have that much going on; and while none of her parts are terrible, she doesn&#39;t have anything very interesting on her, and is&nbsp;an overall bad figure. Therefore, I will be giving her a shocking 1 out of 5. That score might be a bit rough, but this figure is just a bit awful in my eyes. Anyway, that&#39;s it for this very long review. Thanks for reading!</p>
