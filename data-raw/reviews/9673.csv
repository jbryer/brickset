"CapnRex101","2012-07-28T13:45:57.687Z","8909 (7) - Wondrous Weightlifter","<p>The Weightlifter is perhaps my favourite of all the Olympic Minifigures and there are many reasons why, not only does he include some great parts, but the detail printed on his torso and legs is beyond reproach and is very impressive in my opinion. I will get straight on with the review so you can see what the fuss is all about...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Starting at he top as usual, the hair piece is perhaps the dullest section of the&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;as we have seen this piece many times before in this blonde colour. There is some lovely texture in this unkempt hair however and the component suits the character better than any other hair piece I can think of without creating an entirely new mould.</p><p>The head print is wonderful and expresses the determination and power required to lift these weights. It features brown eyebrows, it would have been nice for them to be blonde like the hair but many blonde people do in fact have brown or dark blonde eyebrows so this is perfectly satisfactory. There are also some wrinkles and a determined expression which looks marvellous. A couple of beads of sweat are running down his forehead as well which further suggests the effort being put in to lift the weight.</p><p>A fairly new piece, the medal, is included with this figure like every other Olympic Minifigure and it is very nice indeed. The strap is red and the medallion itself is metallic gold which is lovely and it slides around the neck of the Minifigure very smoothly.&nbsp;</p><p>The torso is very detailed and features a red, white and blue vest with some muscle definition and a brown buckled belt. Some skin is visible around his neck and arms which looks very realistic indeed. The outfit is sleeveless so his arms and hands are yellow and there is no back printing like most of these Olympic Minifigures.</p><p>The legs too are printed with vast amounts of detail including blue and red striping, shorts, shoes, and a small Team GB logo on the left leg which looks marvellous. this design all lines up nicely with the printing on the torso thankfully and makes for an all round great looking figure in my opinion.</p><p>The accessory which comes with the weightlifter is of course a bar weight. It consists of three parts, a 3L white bar piece, and two blue weight pieces which are lovely. Unfortunately the weights cannot be held in two hands by the Minifigure due to the length of the bar, however it is still a nice thing to be included and I like the colour scheme.</p><p>Of course, just like the other Olympic Minifigures, a white base is included with some nice printing on it. This includes the words Team GB,' the Olympic rings and the Team GB logo which all look fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is certainly among my favourites of this series, but due to the fact that the bar is not long enough for the Weightlifter to hold it with both hands like in the actual sport, and that the hair piece used has been used numerous times before and is a little dull, I am going to knock off a point which results in this Minifigure being awarded...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-15T15:33:36.853Z","one of the BEST, but not AMAZING!","<p>The seventh figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Wondrous Weightlifter. This figure retailed for 2 Euro (basically 3 dollars in American terms), was released in 2012, was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, and includes 9 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that tousled hair. The hair itself is nothing too special, as the hair is extremely common. However, the colouring its caste in is NOT common, being that light tan colour. Though it wasn&#39;t new or exclusive, it was pretty uncommon back then, and it&#39;s actually really uncommon, even in today&#39;s time. It&#39;s pretty useful, as well.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which features a fantastic expression. I love how angry he looks, with that sneer, and he even has some cheekbones on the sides. But I think my favourite part of the face is those drips; they make the face extremely useful, though it is weird that they&#39;re white instead of blue. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which has some excellent printing. I love the blue on the inside, red on the outside, and the white lines in between. I also like the yellow flesh around the collar and the arms. The arms themselves are plain yellow, and unfortunately, the figure has no back torso printing. I do really like that black belt printed on the bottom of the torso, though.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, which do include some fantastic printing. I love how the red, white, and blue lines carry on from the torso to the legs really seamlessly, and how it even has that tiny, Team GB logo. The yellow flesh looks great too, especially since it&#39;s printed on the sides as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, which is that weight. The bar itself is just a normal grey pole; it&#39;s the dumbbells that are fantastic. They were new to the Series 2 Weightlifter, but here they&#39;re caste in a new colour, it being blue. From my understanding, they&#39;re exclusive to the figure in that colour, even to this day. They&#39;re a bit useful outside the setting as well.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I think this is one of the better figures in the series, but he still isn&#39;t necessarily amazing. I like all his pieces, especially those blue dumbbells, but he still isn&#39;t super awesome or revolutionary. Also, we already got a Weightlifter figure in Series 2, so even though this figure is based off a generic Team GB teammate, he just doesn&#39;t feel super fresh. In the end, I will give him a 4, but that&#39;s being generous.&nbsp;But that&#39;s all for this figure, so thanks for reading!</p>
