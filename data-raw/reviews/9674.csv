"CapnRex101","2012-07-26T18:01:22.813Z","8909 (8) - Horseback Rider","<p>Perhaps the most highly anticipated of all the Olympic Minifigures, the Horseback Rider is an outstanding Minifigure, and one of my favourites as I had expected. This is the only figure in this series to include a piece which is a brand new mould. A new mould is always a nice thing to have and this one is very unique and a lovely new piece, one which is most likely going to be used again in future, possibly even in some of the new Friends sets this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will start with this new piece, the combined riding helmet and hair piece, which is made of a rubbery material. The helmet is black and has a short brim, along with some shallow grooves running from the crown of the piece to the edges, this is very realistic indeed and a wonderful detail in my opinion. At the back of the helmet there is a tiny hole which would allow many of the attachments in the Friends sets to be attached if you wish. The hair portion of the piece is dark red with a ponytail. In the hair is some excellent texture completing the component perfectly.</p><p>The head is printed on only one side and features some dark red eyebrows to match her hair, a huge grin, and some red lipstick. This is a useful female face and one which might be useful for adding some variation to characters in your Lego City.</p><p>She comes with a gold medal to wear which fits around her neck. The strap is red and the medallion itself is metallic gold in colour, it would have been nice for these medals to be chrome gold, but this may have led to the Minifigures being a little more expensive, and having the medals in metallic gold looks just fine. This piece is included with every single one of these Olympic figures which is very welcome indeed, hopefully it is a sign of things to come this summer for Team GB!</p><p>The torso is printed with a black riding uniform, beneath which a white blouse is visible. There are some red areas of printing on this torso which I believe is intended to be the lining of the pockets. All over these clothes creases are printed and a large blue sash runs across her chest with the words 'Team GB' and the matching logo displayed on it. Standard feminine curves are found on the torso as one would expect. The arms are black, the hands are yellow, and there is no back printing.</p><p>The hips and legs are both printed which is fantastic. The white hips have a continuation of the sash and a red rosette printed on them, while the legs have the bottom half of the rosette and a pair of black boots on them which is nice. Most of the legs are white however, in my opinion black and white is an attractive colour scheme for this figure so I am satisfied with this design.</p><p>The base is cast in white and printed with the Olympic Rings and a Team GB logo in light blue which is very nice indeed.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is, all in all, a superb figure, but I do have one slight problem with it. In my opinion the only let down of this Minifigure is the playability, which is very limited without a horse for her to ride, however, with the new horse available quite commonly, it would not be too hard to get hold of one, and to include one with the figure would be too much to ask unless the price was increased for this particular Minifigure a fair bit, which is unreasonable I think. With only one problem to speak of, I award this figure...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

The hair has a pigtail. The face has a wide nice smile. Also it has a gold medal around its neck! The torso has a blue ribbon around its neck. On the legs there are two colours: black and white.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-18T15:20:42.407Z","printing INSIDE the legs?!?!","<p>The eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Team GB Series is the Horseback Rider. She was released in 2012, was only available in the UK and some parts of Europe, retailed for 2 Euro (basically 3 bucks in American terms), and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair-hat combo, which is just a re-use of a LEGO Friends piece. I don&#39;t even think it was in a new colour here, which is a bit sad. Still, it does fit the figure, and I do still like how the colour and stuff looks, being dark red and black. It&#39;s interesting how it&#39;s rubber as well. Plus, the moulded detail all around it isn&#39;t bad at all.</p>

<p>Next is her head, and I like the expression, where she looks really happy and cheery. The bright red lips are good, as is the aged wrinkles around her mouth. Speaking of which, I so like how her face looks a bit aged, and that increases the usability of that piece. She has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which I suppose does feature some good printing. She includes some wrinkling on the white undershirt, and there&#39;s some detail around the black collar. I like the small spurts of red, like the square on her chest, and also the line towards the bottom of the torso. Of course, one of the most noticeable details is her large&nbsp;blue sash, which contrasts well with the black, and has the great &ldquo;Team GB&rdquo; printing, which includes the white lion logo as well. But like many other CMF&#39;s, she lacks back torso printing, which looks slightly awful, but it&#39;s a common fault, so it can be overlooked.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which feature some fantasia printing. I wanna discuss how that red bow from the torso carries on seamlessly to the torso first, which does just that. However, the most interesting thing about the legs is the black on the bottom, which represent her boots. Those look dual-moulded, but they actually aren&#39;t, as dual-moulded legs weren&#39;t&nbsp;introduced until around 2015, if I&#39;m not mistaking. This figure is amazing, because not only is the black printed on the front and sides, but it&#39;s printed on the INSIDE of the legs!!! That&#39;s just an incredible concept that&#39;s excruciatingly difficult to find in real LEGO sets, despite them being common in knockoff minifig&#39;s. I&#39;m shocked that LEGO put the effort into doing such a niche thing, however it is tremendously appreciated.</p>

<p>And lastly, though it isn&#39;t even included in the picture here on Brickset, she includes a medal accessory. The piece isn&#39;t anything too special nowadays, but at the time of this series&#39; release, it was pretty uncommon, despite it being included in every figure found in this series. I do like the inclusion, and the piece us good, with some gold printing on the medal itself. And the red necklace part of it is pretty nice as well.</p>

<p>But all in all, that&#39;s it for this figure, and she isn&#39;t one of my favourites of the series, as she isn&#39;t super outstanding. However, her head and torso have some okay printing, and her leg detail is superb. However, again, a horseback rider seems like a pretty random choice over more popular tropes. In the end, I&#39;m gonna have to give this figure a 3 out of 5, and that&#39;s being generous, mostly because of her fantastic leg printing. That&#39;s all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
