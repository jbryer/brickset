It is a simple figure, but is great nevertheless. Archery is a sport which Great Britain are occasionally successful in, after we came fairly close to a medal in Beijing and have won medals prior to that. The Minifigure is quite similar to Team GB's archery success in some ways, not bad at all, but hardly outstanding.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I will begin at the top as usual, the hair piece is excellent and exclusive to this Minifigure. The mould is the same as that of Superman in the Super Heroes theme, but on this occasion it is cast in dark orange instead of black like on Superman. The hair features some nice texture and a lovely curl which runs down his forehead and adds something unique to this component.</p><p>The head piece too is wonderful with a very impressive and unique printed design. This features dark orange eyebrows, a winking face with one eye closed as he is focusing on the target, and a smiling expression. I am not aware of any other heads with one eye closed like this one which is interesting and it could be fairly useful for your own figures. There is no printing on the other side of the head.</p><p>The medal which comes with the rest of the Olympic Minifigures of course also features with the Agile Archer. It is a superb piece with a red strap and&nbsp;metallic&nbsp;gold medallion which looks marvellous. It slides nicely around the neck of a Minifigure and rests in a realistic manner down the front of his chest.</p><p>The torso print looks wonderful on this Minifigure and features a creased white shirt with a red and blue Team GB logo on it, and a blue quiver strap which is nice. The shirt is sleeveless resulting in yellow arms, he is however wearing a glove on his shooting hand which is a lovely accurate addition. There is no back printing like many of the other Olympic Minifigures.</p><p>The legs are almost entirely blue and are printed very simply with two white lines which run across the hips and down each leg almost to the feet. Not a bad design but it could perhaps do with some creases or something of that kind to break up this slightly overwhelming block of blue a little more.</p><p>A black bow and arrow comes as an accessory for this figure as you may expect which is exclusive to this figure and is a nice inclusion. This could be one of the main reasons to purchase this figure as cast in black, this bow mould looks better than ever before in my opinion.</p><p>The base is cast in white like the rest of the Olympic Minifigure stands but unlike any other Collectable Minifigure. It is printed with the Olympic rings and a Team GB logo.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Archer is a wonderful Minifigure, but it is not nearly the best of the collection and one which I would recommend, but not as an absolute must have figure unless you are looking to get a complete collection. The hair piece, head, and black bow are all nice parts and they certainly add to the appeal of this particular figure for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
