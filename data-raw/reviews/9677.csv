"legogal","2014-04-15T16:02:17.967Z","A great little set for parts!","<p>I totally agree with the review of&nbsp;Skywalker 1966. This is an amazing little set. Perfect for displaying your favorite minifigs or for parting out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you build buildings, you need lots of white pieces...window frames with glass, 4 by 6 plates and 1 by 6 columns as well as 2 by 2 jumper plates. With 89 pieces including a blue spaceman minifig, this is an extremely good value at 10US. (I did even better at LL Florida last month and found them at half off.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the great review Skywalker!</p>
