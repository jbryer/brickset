<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">FOREWORD</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">I am not a racing fanatic, a
Ferrari enthusiast, nor a general car expert, not even for LEGO速 cars. But I
shall be making this review to try to describe the set and the build on neutral
terms, so to speak.&nbsp; I also do not have
other sets which may show the same model, bigger or smaller, so I do not have a
point of comparison. I leave it to other LEGO速 &amp; Ferrari enthusiasts to
give, perhaps, a better viewpoint.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">____________________________________________________________________________</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">There are a lot of classic cars out there. More than just being labelled vintage, they evoke a sense of nostalgia for times when everything was better and were made better. What, then, when you combine these sentiments with a creation from well-renowned brands?&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">THE BAG</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">Everything is as it is with &nbsp;the rest of the sets.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8059/8197124834_e26ba40576.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8196028169_00b0ac1c88.jpg[/img]</p><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">THE CONTENTS</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">This set is pretty bereft of parts. Though barely a handful, this is more than made up for by the printed elements that go with it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8196051509_88c14c3641.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8058/8196050811_2efff56ae8.jpg[/img]</p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">THE INSTRUCTION LEAFLET</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">...is a reflection of the number of parts herein. It's just one page, with the back showing bigger than usual illustrations of the other cars in the promo...which makes me wonder if that was better off as a separate poster altogether?</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8197142468_783d82a779.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8196049441_147e04f4c2.jpg[/img]</p><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">THE STICKER SHEET</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We still get the decals protected by the box. Therein is a pretty interesting grill pattern. It's not very busy, at all. This also means that you don't have to tire yourself putting on these things.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8197139814_d5bab65052.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">THE BUILD</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Everything put up, it's starting to look promising, sans the stickers. There's definitely that classic feel to it at first glance. Although the front end seems to be protruding forward a bit too much for comfort, this does not affect the overall image too much for me. Also, it's the fastest build in the series, almost faster than you can say SHELL FERRARI LEGO<span style=""font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;

But you might agree that it could stand alone without most of them. Sometimes, you can't do more justice to a car that already looks good in the first place.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8196046823_04aacd5ece.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8196045941_18fce99518.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8197137008_43a3f89b67.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8483/8196044181_68c4c6b551.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8196043213_6f164ca802.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8210/8197134306_0669bff08d.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8196041515_9d2ba9e57b.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">THE ""EXTRA""</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Yes, it's just one...a clear, transaparent 1x1 tile, which I just couldn't get enough of, but I really don't need to show.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">OVERALL IMPRESSION</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">First off, I'm a sucker for vintage cars (we have a beetle)...not those pimped-up and spunked to who knows what until you could no longer recognize them. This one is a very simple build, yet achieves a look that definitely says it's from a bygone era. Though, one issue I have is at the back of the car:</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8346/8196040833_5eeb4bb224.jpg[/img]</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">There is that gap there that's almost a stud wide which gives it an incomplete look when viewed the way it is in the picture. Though I could imagine that the car may look a wee bit better being a tad longer, there's just so much to love about it that it just blows you away, and makes that gap forgivable...sort of. The build is simple, the parts are adequately sparse, and everything put in gives you this adorable little auto.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Clutch power of the elements are still superb. Again, stickers are few and that also adds up to a quick build, which you may or may not like, depending on the spectrum where you belong. The only job that is tedious is trying to align the grill pattern to where it should be, as it is hard to really view it from the pictures because it is demonstrated obliquely. You can view reference photos of the real thing if you like, just chose the iteration in red which suits you best that you come across with.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Lastly, this should be considered as one of the must haves. Maybe if you can only purchase a few, make this the second or the third. As of this writing, prices for this set can become ridiculously high on ebay (maybe because of the printed parts) which more than gives us a hint of the real value of this set, or what it may become in the future, considering that the whole world may become flooded by them in the coming months.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Thanks for viewing.
