But I shall be making this review to try to describe the set and the build on neutral terms, so to speak. &nbsp;I also do not have other sets which may show the same model, bigger or smaller, so I do not have a point of comparison. I leave it to other LEGO® &amp; Ferrari enthusiasts to give, perhaps, a better viewpoint.</div><div>______________________________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>We have another Ferrari which is not in the usual red that I am accustomed to, but this looks like a great car all the same. Here is the Ferrati 458 Italia.</div><div><br></div><div>THE BAG</div><div><br></div><div>The standard polybag for all the cars in the promo...</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/8166772565_ce9cf9dd43.jpg[/img]</div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/8166773185_34cb25407e.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>THE CONTENTS</div><div><br></div><div>The selection is rather sparse. If not for the printed parts, this is pretty wanting. But at least the said parts are really good to look at and we don't have to trouble ourselves with putting decals on critical areas. The wheel assembly is also similar to the F40.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7276/8166788486_83323c63d4.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Another look at those parts...nice curves, eh?</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/8166794372_6941b71697.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>I don't know if this is the real deal, but there seems to be a misprint on the rear of the right hand side for this part (rear window print?). I would much rather have them equally printed on.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7246/8166794048_52d4ccc473.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div></div><div>THE INSTRUCTION LEAFLET</div><div><br></div><div>This &nbsp;is rather small compared to the first sets I reviewed, which is reflective of the contents herein. This promises to be a quick build, indeed.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7255/8166793798_678d3fd8c3.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8166789122_a6af8d449f.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>THE STICKER SHEET</div><div><br></div><div>We have a rather small sticker sheet inside a relatively big box. Still, I was hesitant to put the Prancing Pony logo onto the car, because it looks good (and might look better on some other similar themed car).</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8166790412_21ebac16d7.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/8166761081_95aac1528f.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div></div></div></div></div><div>THE BUILD</div><div><br></div><div>Construction was pretty quick, as expected. Despite that, we come up with a car that pretty much stands on it's own, even without those decals. And it looks outstanding, too.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8166889795_1fa358be64.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>Adding the decals, it but only adds a somewhat miniscule improvement, if it were not for the purely Ferrari marks that these have. Same goes for the rear decal. Still, we now have a car that looks slightly better, whereas it was already good beforehand.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8063/8166761847_40c6ba2d57.jpg[/img]</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7263/8166762173_2d9c51cccc.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7271/8166763175_f519ed0fda.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8166762435_18bc10723e.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div><br></div></div><div>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7106/8166792450_81dbf07682.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>THE EXTRAS</div><div><br></div><div>As sparse as the parts are, we have even fewer extras, which I no longer need to describe.</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8166790942_a7062320c6.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>OVERALL IMPRESSION</div><div><br></div><div>So, we have this really fine and sporty car which was built pretty fast, but still is a looker just the same. I now know that the special parts for the exterior are not new, but you just have to admire the way it greatly improves the look though it may take away a lot of the fun in a rather more complex build. Even if this will suffer a little in terms of the building challenge, it's still a good set to consider buying if they come somewhere near you.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it's a nice and simple car with the added fun of that pull-back motor. This one does not deserve my rant...</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for viewing. PLAY WELL!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
