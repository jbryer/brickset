But I shall be making this review to try to describe the set and the build on neutral terms, so to speak. &nbsp;I also do not have other sets which may show the same model, bigger or smaller, so I do not have a point of comparison. I leave it to other LEGO® &amp; Ferrari enthusiasts to give, perhaps, a better viewpoint.</div><div>______________________________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>At first glance, I had a feeling I was going to have some bias against this set. It appeared stocky in the pictures. But pictures can be deceiving, so a more hands on feel might do some justice. Here is the Ferrari F40.</div><div><br></div><div>THE BAG</div><div><br></div><div>As usual, everything is pretty much the same as all of the car sets in this group.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157958077/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/8157958077_6f8191e507.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8158000604/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7251/8158000604_b91655a7ae.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div></div><div>THE CONTENTS</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157999770/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7271/8157999770_5e12f60be1.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>Out of the bag, it’s beginning to feel bulky as the brick and the large slope make their way out. We still have the usual white box with the sticker sheet, and the instruction sheet. It still has a rather interesting selection of parts. The main attraction, again aside from the motor, would have to be the printed front end/hood.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157990582/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8198/8157990582_4fd9925313.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>Also, the wheels don’t have an exposed central portion, so there is no color contrast of a white and black axle when you look at them at one side. The spoke design is also pretty neat.</div><div><br></div><div>THE INSTRUCTION LEAFLET</div><div><br></div><div>It’s just a little bit busy, with not so much missed steps. Or maybe it’s also because the parts are mainly in white so the build is not that confusing?</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157963401/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7257/8157963401_157a3a3729.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157959653/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8348/8157959653_46d3d340c7.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div></div><div>THE STICKER SHEET</div><div><br></div><div>Here again is the dreaded sticker sheet, protected by the box. The dread will soon be revealed…</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157991000/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/8157991000_e065de5ea5.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>THE BUILD</div><div><br></div><div>Completed, we have a rather blocky car with a lot of sharp angles and an almost haphazard array of colors being overpowered by the white parts above them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157959853/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/8157959853_702957e148.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>Even with the elimination of the most unflattering angles, it still needs something to spruce it up.</div><div>&nbsp;Enter the decals:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157965223/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7106/8157965223_4c25fe7491.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157998234/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7111/8157998234_e4d07d62d4.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157962285/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/8157962285_2ef6034cc0.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157963831/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8157963831_68b16c303d.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157966429/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/8157966429_1649821c67.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157996292/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7254/8157996292_07854a5c11.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div>Now we have more character and depth with the black outlines. Yet, there is still that perception of bulkiness as the decals don’t completely cut off the sharp angles. It seems the only thing that smoothens up this car is the front end. The problem is it does not completely break off the angles for the whole picture.</div><div><br></div><div>THE EXTRAS</div><div><br></div><div>You get 1 red and 1 black 1x1 round plate, a white 1x1 plate, and a white and yellow cheese slope.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157960073/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8157960073_e82c7dff75.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>OVERALL IMPRESSION</div><div><br></div><div>So I guess I may have justified my bias against it. I searched for online reference pictures for this set. I was getting more disappointed as I was seeing a sea of red, gorgeous cars, but as I was about to give up, I came upon this: http://www.ferraris-online.com/pages/carintro.php?reqcardir=FE-F40GT-80742</div><div><br></div><div>So there, I presume, is where this car was based. I still have to think that somehow the representation is a bit off. Again, there is no good marriage with the curved front and the blocky back. Not even the thought that there is a printed hood for this set can make it good for me (though it might make the resale value higher in the future). &nbsp;It’s not gorish, though significantly unpleasing to the eye. Maybe the studs on top make it appear blockier. There may have been some use for a snot technique there using something else to replace the slope and brick. Trying to view it at all angles, it’s still hard for me to appreciate the “visual beauty” of this set (you may just love this for what it is, you know).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The white tile at the back makes the rear look bare, as maybe the width of the car is also wanting. Then, there is the spoiler…even that looks too big. But I guess it’s just hard to make something as thin with the parts available for rendering the set in bricks. &nbsp;Maybe it’s the scale it was represented in so that it was hard to capture everything there should be. Or maybe I’m asking too much. It really feels like it’s a kid’s toy car. Sure, it was intended for kids…but, hey, what about us kids at heart, eh?</div><div><br></div><div>For the stickers, it was quite disappointing to apply the triangular piece for the windows, as it was hard to really get a good balance for the white outline that will envelope the decal, even with the greatest care I could summon upon myself. Even the tweezers didn’t help much for the task. Herein does the dread lie!</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157964731/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8157964731_796e0f7899.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8157964731/]S[/url] by [url=http://www.flickr.com/people/56989301@N04/]Orthobotrex[/url], on Flickr</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Still, clutch power remains good, which would be essential for this particular set (there, a redeeming factor).</div><div><br></div><div>In summary, I am not so pleased with the way this car looks, but that shouldn’t stop you from buying it. Maybe the “completists” will be the ones more delighted in this set. I’ll probably just use this one for racing. Perhaps my kid will love it more than I.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for viewing. PLAY WELL!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
