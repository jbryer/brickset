Seeing as how it is so new I'm not too surprised that not too many of you own this yet, I am a little bit surprised to see that despite the pictures of the bag showing Frodo Brickset hasn't listed this set with a Minifigure yet, as it does come with one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Model: What you are getting in this set are 33 pieces, what you are building from most of those pieces is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Table with Keg Hobbit Sized</p>
<p>1 Small open area cooking place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that is pretty much it, so why have I rated this set so high when the model itself is fairly ho-hum? The pieces mate, it's all about the pieces. First of all you're getting a really cheap set with Shire Frodo the Mini-Fig, on top of this you are recieving a golden challice, one of the new PotC Bottle Pieces and a LEGO hot dog. (Not sure of its rarity, but this is the first one I own.) You also get two green stems and four white flowers as bonus parts, you can use those for anything your heart desires. Filling up a great garden of flowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am surprised LEGO Gave us the Frodo Shire character with this Polybag, if anything making this one feature old Bilbo might have tripled it's value, but still, Frodo is nice enough to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He includes the double sided torso also found in Gandalf Arrives and a double sided head with happy face and worried face, the printing and level of detail is quite excellent, and I love the new Hobbit hair piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd have to say that this set is well worth tracking down, especially if you want more bottles on the cheap, or if for some reason you can not afford Gandalf Arrives just yet, it makes for a cheap alternative to get the Frodo Shire mini-fig, and is also a wonderful impulse buy. Ah yes, it also includes a frying pan, which I forgot to mention, but that isn't really a rare enough piece to make a big fuss over. Highly Recommended to LotR fans and LEGO Mini-Fig fans especially.</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,3,5
"Svenstead","2012-12-11T03:25:28.07Z","Same old, Same old","<p>I bought this set online for just under $20 (P&amp;H not included). I had been searching for this set because it seemed quite interesting. I do not own many poly bags, but from what I hav read from other reviews, this seems pretty standard.</p><p>It is almost as though LEGO do not care for the playability in these sets, only the pieces and the look. The set has many useful pieces such as the bottle, the fire and the sausage (rarish). The barrel of drink is not too amazing, the barrel falls off (and spills all that drink), but it looks nice and serves its purpose. On to the cooking corner!</p><p>The cooking corner is well designed, but again not much playability. The pan sits on the fire and can be removed. The fire piece is useful and sits nicely under the pan. The rest of the cooking corner is not too much to be cheering about, but it is still good.</p><p>Frodo is the minifig included in this set. He is has some very useful parts to him, such as his head, legs and arms. The head has the double-sided feature; one side is his normal face and the other side is a look of terror (not sure what he would be scared about in this set though, maybe the fire!) This is one good feature of playability. His arms are in that rare greenish colour, which is good for people who want to create custom figures. The legs are standard but very useful when making other creations!</p><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Very good pieces</li><li>Can easily by used with othe LOTR and Hobbit sets</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Not very much playability (more for AFOL's)</li><li>Quite similar to every other polybag (nothing special)</li></ul><p>Overall I would give this a 3/5. I think that because of the lack of playability and the rare/good pieces that this is more aimed at AFOL's. I think that if LEGO increased the level of playability in there polybags in general then they could get more kids interested.</p><p>Thanks for reading my first review!</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"lkb57","2014-02-07T04:52:20.447Z","A Missed Opportunity","<p>This is a fun little set, with lot&#39;s of interesting minifig accessories, perfect for kitting out a Hobbit hole or castle. But every time I look at Frodo, I can&#39;t help but ask &quot;Why Lego? Why didn&#39;t you make a new exclusive minifigure? The version of Frodo I have in mind is<a href=""http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080318213759/lotr/images/0/0b/Frodo.sting.jpg""> this guy</a>. See what I mean? It&#39;s the perfect opportunity for a third Frodo with a white shirt and brown vest. If pressed, I&#39;d probably name this imaginary minifigure &quot;Business Casual&quot; Frodo, since he&#39;s clearly not as relaxed as the Frodo we get in the actual polybag, but isn&#39;t quite as ready for adventure as this <a href=""http://www.1000steine.com/brickset/minifigs/large/lor028.jpg"">Frodo</a>.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Like I mentioned above, the main reason I was excited for this set was the copious amounts of food-related accessories: a sausage, a goblet, a skillet, a bottle and a keg (er . . . small barrel). Other than the accessories, there is nothing too exciting about the pieces offered in this particular polybag.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this Frodo minifig. It just could have been a new exciting one. That&#39;s all. The Frodo minifig that is included is superb, as is usual for TLC, with front and back printing on the torso and a double-sided happy/nervous face.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is surprisingly clever for how few pieces are involved. When you&#39;re done, you end up with a stove, an ale keg and a flower. The grill is the best part, and way more detailed than I expected.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In short, if you&#39;re a completionist, you&#39;ll get this set anyways; if you&#39;re not, and you just want this version of Frodo, save your pennies and buy <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9469-1/Gandalf-Arrives"">9469 Gandalf Arrives</a>.</p>

A must have for a LotR/Castle collector and a nice additional set for other Lego fans. Usefull in several MOC's and a lovely looking stand alone set.</p><p>Building 3 bricks : Not a great building effort, a nicely designed stove and a table and the assembling of Frodo. Three bricks are sufficient.</p><p>Parts 5 bricks : Great parts in this little set with as&nbsp;best part of course Frodo of the Shire. Very usefull&nbsp;accesoires being the bottle, the golden cup, saucepan, sausage&nbsp;and the flowers.</p><p>Playability 3 bricks : Standing alone not too much playing fun, this set or parts of it gets his value combined with other (LotR) sets.</p><p>Value 5 bricks : I bought this set together 30211 for â‚¬&nbsp;6,50 each which I think it is definitly a good price considering its content. If you keep it sealed the value will definitly rise in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-06-01T06:23:58.857Z","Nice minifigure, but pointless set","<p>I already owned the Frodo minifigure, and since I was already placing an order on Bricklink I decided to see if I could also get the bricks for this set.&nbsp; Not only could I get them, but they of course cost next to nothing so I got them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of a silly set, I suppose it belongs in Bag End, but the oven looks more like a grill to me than an oven, and the keg (which has an absurdly simple stand) I feel belongs more at Bilbo&#39;s 111th birthday party.</p>

<p>I do like the idea of a cooking set with Lord of the Rings, but feel that Frodo was simply the wrong choice for the set.&nbsp; I would much have prefered the set to either contain Merry or Pippin either foolishly cooking at the old lookout on Weathertop or enjoying the spoils of Isengard.</p>

<p>If you need a Frodo minifigure this is a nice cheap way to get one.&nbsp; And of you want some kitchen objects to go with it all the better.&nbsp; However, there really isn&#39;t much of a point to this set.</p>

"Captainfives1514","2023-02-12T12:31:09.65Z","Kitchen at Bagend","<p>&nbsp;I got this polybag back in two thousand and twelve for Christmas. It was an excellent way to get Frodo Baggins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Minifigure;</strong>&nbsp;this minifigure is exclusive to this and Gandalf&#39;s arrival set. He has the new hairpiece that was made for hobbits in dark brown. His double-sided face has a smiling expression on one side and a concerned expression on the other. His torso is printed in sand green with suspender straps. His legs are dark brown kid legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is mostly a ale barrel and the kitchen stove with a cup and a bouquet of flowers thrown in. Excellent additions for Baggend.</p>
