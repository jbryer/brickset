But I shall be making this review to try to describe the set and the build on neutral terms, so to speak. &nbsp;I also do not have other sets which may show the same model, bigger or smaller, so I do not have a point of comparison. I leave it to other LEGO® &amp; Ferrari enthusiasts to give, perhaps, a better viewpoint.</div><div>____________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>What could be sexier than red? It’s black, of course. &nbsp;At least to me it is. It’s more bold, too, but enough of that. And so what could be a more appropriate color for a head-turning car? Here comes…The LEGO® Ferrari FXX.</div><div><br></div><div>THE BAG</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the front and back of the bag. Everything is pretty standard with the assembled car in front, the statements at the back, and the Shell-Ferrari-LEGO® marks, logos and serial numbers, etc.</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154267478/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/8154267478_583aeddd34.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154274196/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/8154274196_e8861b5931.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>THE CONTENTS</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the contents of the bag, again with the different elements, the white box with the sticker sheet, and the instruction leaflet. You may need a lot of space for pouring these out and grouping them.&nbsp;</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154240597/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7263/8154240597_d1af049b88.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154242851/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7275/8154242851_bf6c23b813.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div></div><div>It has a fairly large piece count for its size, almost all in gorgeous black. But I think the centerpiece of this set is the pull-back motor.&nbsp;</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154272450/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8154272450_ddf499a384.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>Quoting the promotional leaflet: “Shell and technical partner Ferrari have teamed up with the LEGO® Group to bring you six exclusive models. All are powered by revolutionary micro-propulsion-the smallest ever LEGO pull back motor.” Imagine that? Or if you can’t, here it is side by side with an old, loose LEGO® pull back motor. Don't let the number of studs distract you...the new one is really small, indeed.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154243439/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7261/8154243439_8b9cf2383b.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>THE INSTRUCTION SHEET</div><div><br></div><div>This looks pretty standard. What I noticed when I was building the model is that there were several steps that were skipped, so that if you don’t really pay attention, you may miss out putting some of &nbsp;the parts where they belong, especially since almost everything is in black. There's not even an arrow to show the parts that have been placed already.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154241591/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7251/8154241591_a9f0b3db4e.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154271710/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8154271710_6d38619724.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div></div><div>THE BUILD</div><div><br></div><div>Following the instructions carefully, we come up with this assembled model (pardon the editing of the picture):</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154269650/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8203/8154269650_fd6a8e437a.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>HOLY SMOKES! It looks like…well, it brings to mind the car of the caped crusader…which means it’s bad-ass-good! Every part of the build is so well executed that you are able to get this voluptuous little automobile. But, wait, what’s missing? Stickers, of course…and here is what I think you need to apply them at precisely the right position:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154251415/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8154251415_14cfb68bfa.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>Again, don’t throw the rest away when you are through. You can still use that sticker sheet. It’s still official LEGO® scrap!</div><div><br></div><div>HA! Now, isn’t it looking a lot groovier? Just look at those wheels...I can almost hear it accelerate to a VVVRRRRrrroooooooooomm…&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154282330/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7137/8154282330_2a49fc972f.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154279500/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8154279500_948b84ef5f.jpg[/img][/url]</div></div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154252435/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8348/8154252435_6bbe5fc8b1.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154280594/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/8154280594_cceb5229b9.jpg[/img][/url]</div></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154253571/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8154253571_22c70cb9d3.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154254169/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8063/8154254169_bd0ca38fc2.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154255927/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/8154255927_eb88d6e5bf.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>THE EXTRAS</div><div><br></div><div>You get a 2x3 LBG plate, a red1x1 round plate, a black cheese slope, and a black 1x1 tile. The LBG plate is not only ""odd"" (pun intended), I didn’t expect something as large to be an extra (is it rare and unusual or rare but not unusual). I went back to the instructions, but everything that was needed to be in place was. I mean, I’m used to getting the smaller pieces, but, again, this is most welcome.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154269372/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8154269372_88aa27f75b.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>OVERALL IMPRESSION</div><div><br></div><div>In my opinion, this is a well built LEGO® mini car, with all the angles and curves achieved. Though there is one small space at both sides where you can almost see what’s inside, it is a minor distraction.&nbsp;</div><div><div>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8154445732/][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7275/8154445732_6d94564cd7.jpg[/img][/url]</div><div><br></div></div><div>Also, since the axles for the rear wheels are white, the difference is quite noticeable. Also, try to be careful when putting the wheels in place, as the axles are small, they might be damaged with forceful assembly.</div><div><br></div><div>Still, the parts selection involved I should say was very well thought of. All are almost plate-sized, the kind of parts you really use to achieve detail. Everything is a good source of parts for future MOCs.</div><div><br></div><div>Though the stickers are seldom welcome in any build, you can’t help but agree that they do add more character. It’s just that even if you are at the intended age of this set, you will need some patience, precision, a good pair of tweezers, and a good degree of breath-holding skills in putting on the decals…and yes, preferably an adult to help you. Sometimes adding up a mini car and even smaller stickers plus a kid to a build may be equivalent to a disaster. Still, let us just be thankful, again, that TLG has provided boxes to keep them undamaged. Again, we may expect them to peel off in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Putting this to a test drive is also quite a treat. Even at the diminutive size of the motor, it still achieves a good acceleration. This is quite a feat!</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, clutch power for the parts is also very good. I guess it’s to keep everything intact during an inadvertent impact. We don’t want everything blown up, do we?</div><div><br></div><div>If you have the chance, buy this beauty. It’ll be worth it!</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for viewing! PLAY WELL!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
