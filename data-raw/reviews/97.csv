"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-03T08:26:07Z","Loco not to own this.","I have waited in eager anticipation for this set for several weeks now, and I was not disappointed. This is an excellent representation of the EMD GP38 and the BNSF livery in particular – featuring a new shade of dark green unique to this set. This builds up into a very good representation of the prototype correctly featuring the different sides. One improvement to accuracy you can make straight away is to fit the bricks/tiles representing radiator grilles with the louvers vertical instead of horizontal as shown in the instructions. Some bricks used to create the correct profiles are 1 x 1 steep roof bricks that I have never seen before. Handrails use SW battle droid arms for support. Stickers are included for letters and numbers (which strictly speaking should be green rather than black) and roof fans and other details. Some, but not all, of these could have been printed, but I guess it is cheaper to use stickers. Engineer Minifig is nice, and the conductor comes into his own when you have the rest of the train not just the loco. Instructions include how to motorise the loco (which I think is pretty obvious) and, less obviously, how to fit a working light. 

I have bought 2 of these so that I can have them coupled as a pair with the cabs at the outer ends, as I have seen several photos of them running like that. This will mean that I will have to work on making up an alternative number for one, as no alternatives are included in the set – which would have been a nice touch. Numbers are also missing for the rear end. 

This has to be a 10 due to the accuracy of the set in terms of  profile and colours - it is one of the best I have seen, but no doubt I will still add my extra little finishing touches as I think of them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-13T22:38:30Z","Fine colored GP-38 but is it better than the Super Chief?","Beautifully engineered, this GP-38 is built in orange, yellow, and new dark green pieces. New parts include the 1x1 slants in green and orange used on the front end and bumpers from the cargo engine of set 4512. The true question is, &quot;what's a nicer engine: this or the Super Chief&quot;? A few observations: once built, your figs won't be getting inside the main body unlike the Super Chief. No easy-lifting roof except for the driver compartment attached only by a 1x2 circle-piece. The main body is also not as tall; however, the front (driver compartment) is the same height just allowing enough space to enter our favorite train engine shed. But be careful, if the railings protrude a little too much, the sides will hit your shed. I don't know if this set is really more detailed than the Chief, just a different engine. I think the new color and the overall color scheme make it a beautiful set, not to mention a few other items including the side rails, rear red lights, wheel assembly, and removable front compartment.
I'm sure the other train buffs will hold a lengthy debate on what engine is better, but my answer, I love them both. Very much worth the wait. I can't wait until Lego comes out with the rolling stock. - Just wish they'd nix the stickers!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-25T01:24:46Z","Fantastic Train","I was driving around the gorge area in Oregon on a road trip - saw this train only to come home and find 10133 in in the mail.

It is by far an amazing piece of work. Very realistic, good color scheme.... A very good representation of the actual.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cloud2296","2007-12-03T20:14:05.7Z","Really Good, Exact Look","This is a great set. All around, it had a great color scheme, those trumpet looking things on top and some other rare pieces, some good minifigs withe a handkerchief, and some good stickers. I got it when I first saw it in the back of the magazine, and I begged my grandma to get it. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it doesn't come with an electronic wheel thing for it to ride on the track. Overall great set. Please get it for your pleasure!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lost_Cosmonaut","2009-05-26T16:22:54.717Z","My favorite until the Emerald Night came out!","When I saw this in the LEGO stores a few years ago I ~HAD~ to have it.  These trains constantly go through our area (which has a long rich history as a train town).  It's a great train set, especially if you are a fan of this type of train.

Sure, it's not as fancy or good-looking as the Super Chief, but that didn't matter to me.  I see these very trains every day here in town so that was the main reason I had to have this particular train.  The color scheme is spot on to the real thing, as are many of the details.

It's too bad that the new Emerald Night is so huge compared to this one.  Hopefully LEGO will put out a new line of trains of all types to fit the new larger more ""in scale"" size they went with for the Emerald Night.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Both are iconic diesel locomotives of the American West, presumably oriented towards a North American market, and both were accompanied by separate sets of cars for them to pull. In the case of 10133, these accompanying cars were the TTX intermodal freight cars of 10170, and buying multiples of 10170 allowed builders to construct full-length freight trains. Lego has often released complementary freight and passenger trains, and together the Santa Fe Super Chief and BNSF Locomotive offer the possibility of full-length historical trains in each category.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

All of these locomotives share a distinctive setback behind the cabin as well as a set of walkways along either side of the engine and in front of the cabin. Lego have chosen a setback of one stud on each side, resulting in a six-wide cabin followed by a four-wide body. From the side, or from a three quarters profile, this looks relatively realistic, especially because it allows wide walkways. From the front or above, however, the four-wide engine looks too narrow.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Photographs of EMD locomotives from above show that the engine is indeed quite narrow, but this contradicts the experience of looking at a comparable locomotive as it sits in a yard or proceeds through a level crossing. From these vantage points, such locomotives convey a sense of bulkiness and power. Paradoxically, the lateral proportions of 10133 are reasonably accurate, but the impression it conveys belies my experience of living around these trains.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The cabin is slightly oversized given that the roof ought to be level between the cabin and the body, and 10133 consequently lacks the correct profile. Moreover, the engine as a whole is too tall. Producing a model of appropriate vertical proportions using a 6x28 plate would appear to have produced an engine disproportionately small relative to minifigures. The present compromise is only partially successful.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Details along the sides and the top of the engine&mdash;textured bricks, doors, panels&mdash;offer variety, and the designers have replicated the engine&rsquo;s asymmetries, particularly the chunk on the port side offset by half a stud from the rest of the engine.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

This dramatically reduces the interest of the set, and it has never captured my imagination the way 10020 has. The instructions include guidance on how to install a motor and a headlight using the 9V system, which work well and improve the set&rsquo;s playability. More recent Power Functions fixtures could be installed only with major modifications along the lines of 10219.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The body of the engine has been widened slightly by SNOT plates, which allows an engine in the interior. The undercarriage has been improved, and the walkway in front of the nose has been widened, which further emphasizes this characteristic feature. The distinctive flat profile has been achieved.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

They represent a compromise between the limited parameters of the 6-wide 9V system and the ambition to create sophisticated historical models. 10194 Emerald Night was released in 2009, only four years after 10133, and represents a complete reconceptualization of the historical train model, at once jettisoning the 6x28 carriage plate, the six-stud width, and the 9V system and its concomitant limitations on driving wheels. These changes permitted the greater realism subsequently achieved.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

These models benefit from higher standards of design sophistication and larger part counts, but they lack the ambition of 10020 and 10133, which envisioned complete, expandable trains through the modest offering of one or two additional sets. Lego no longer has the commitment to rolling stock it had in the early noughts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
