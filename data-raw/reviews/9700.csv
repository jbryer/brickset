If you need complexity in your builds, then like most poly-bag sets, this mining-Dozer will put you to sleep.</p><p><br></p><h4>Pro's:<br></h4><ul><li>Quick Build - Very reminiscent of many early 80's Space and Town sets<br></li><li>Very Zoomable</li><li>Small Vehicle to fit into any construction site setting (including street scenes)</li><li>Includes part 64550 - Black Windscreen/Roll Cage</li><li>Includes part 30394 - Yellow ""Digger"" Bucket<br>Includes a miner with a smirk on his face that makes one want to move bricks with the bucket</li><li>Includes X2 part 98138 - the round 1x1 trans clear tile.&nbsp;</li><li>The yellow and black color combo is carried throughout the set, including the rims of the wheels.</li><li>Inexpensive way to gain a large number of miners with miner style hard hats :)</li><li>A fleet of these diggers could fit on the bed of a City sized semi-trailer, to simulate new product being delivered cross-country :)<br><br></li></ul><h4>Con's:</h4><ul><li>Quick Build - will not excite some older builders who want complexity in their builds</li><li>Parts/Price ratio over 10 cents per piece (American). <br></li><li>Was a promotional set in England, which might limit availability for many people.</li><li>Contains about five pieces which would be considered unique to most fans of Lego<br></li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Post-Build Reaction<br></h4><p>All-in-all, the playability and zoom-ability of this set makes it a pleasure to own. For those who build MOCs, this set could quickly be transformed into a bit more complex Bobcat-Skid Steer, and makes for a fun ""office display"" for people like me who now work in an office setting instead of Agriculture/construction.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, part 98138 is still new to many builders, and the inclusion of this 
piece and the Roll Cage was a nice bit of excitement for me, as I do MOC
 quite a bit, but also like to buy my pieces/sets in a store setting 
(instead of online).</p><p><br></p><h4>AFOL Flashback <br></h4><p>On a personal note, this set automatically caused a flash-back to set 6628 (Shell Tow Truck from 1981) and Classic Space set 6821 (Shovel Buggy from 1980). I was reminded of the simple joy a set like this can bring by only having one mini-figure, four wheels, and the feel of two other movable-parts (the bucket tilts and the roll cage flips up/backwards).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,4

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-31T18:51:14.807Z","Delving into the Mine","<p>Set #30151 Mining Dozer: This nifty little City Polybag is a welcome change from the countless Fire and Police Polybagged Sets LEGO has made for the better part of a decade. (Give or take a few years.)</p>
<p>You get 32 pieces in this set, one of the pieces is the large black canopy piece introduced with Power Miners, and a second one is a large yellow dozer piece. This may affect the value for money, since you get some pretty large pieces in this set, so the dollar-per-piece ratio is a bit questionable. Polybags are 5$ in Canada though and what you're getting here is well worth that asking price. Because not only is this little build quite fun, and a great accessory/vehicle for the larger Mine sets from City, but it's also the cheapest way to snag one of those sweet new mining hats LEGO has introduced this year.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure doesn't use any new or unique pieces besides the mining hat, so you've pretty much got a standard City Worker torso with overalls print, it's a double-sided print on the torso though which is always nice to see in Polybags. He's got regular blue legs, a face that looks like the print was introduced around the time of Power Miners with a small scratch and some stubble. He also has found a golden jewel piece while digging in the mine.</p>
<p>Overall this is a pretty nifty set, and as far as Polybags goes it's decent enough value for your dollar, especially if you got it for free this past year during the LEGO Giveaway in Europe/The UK. I think the vehicle could use a bit of bulking up honestly, but I still think it was a good purchase.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
