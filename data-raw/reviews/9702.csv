I wonder if it's as fast as the racers?<div><br></div><div>THE BAG</div><div>Same as the others...</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8197126198_f02992105a.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8197118874_262fd46b82.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>THE CONTENTS</div><div><br></div><div>There are only a few interesting parts here. Maybe some are rare, like the slopes. There are a handful of bricks, but that is not issue since the build is for a truck, anyway.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8197121742_744569576c.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8197120714_d87d2ce020.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>A closer look at the sticker sheet and I have what seems to be a misprint of some sort on one of the decals, though I guess it's because it's already too small</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8197129766_d24a71ac0d.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>THE INSTRUCTION SHEET</div><div><br></div><div>Again, pretty standard, and not so much quick assembly steps with this set.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8348/8196031991_e6ced573dd.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8197122748_c4d02fe5c5.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>THE BUILD</div><div><br></div><div>Once assembled, you have this blocky, almost heavy-for-the-motor truck that looks pretty basic, except that I find the way that the front end was built to be pretty interesting as it is able to achieve a lot of curves with a clever use of the parts and with building from the side, essentially. Though it may not look as close as the original truck I looked up in the net, this is pretty darn good.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8487/8196028969_f16c6cd0d3.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Now applying the stickers again, it now acquires quite a bit of character than without them, especially the front, which at first, looks like a robot's face, really. This is one set that is heavily dependent on decals to bring out some substantial difference to its looks.</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8197130468_d3ff941f4c.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/8197153876_cc426c5fba.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8196062031_3c6d643078.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8196062685_a522f16c24.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8484/8196063653_27e78a0b43.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8485/8197131362_72df8296ec.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>THE EXTRA PARTS</div><div><br></div><div>Well...see anything? There's not even one extra part! I guess the 1x2 cheese slope is too much to give away.</div><div><br></div><div>OVERALL IMPRESSION</div><div><br></div><div>This is one of the sets in the series I liked more because of the building techniques I'm really not accustomed to (also because I really don't have most of the parts used). It's a nice set to get a hands-on feel on how to have a stable build with bricks on a precarious position. I even appreciate some of the curves herein that I don't see from comparison pics of the real vehicle, especially the top part, since I get the impression that this is a sporty truck.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The heavy use of decals poses challenges in putting them correctly, which can really be demanding, especially if you want them dead center. &nbsp;It makes the truck look better, though, and I don't think we can have many printed parts here as we would wish, so it's another compromise.</div><div><br></div><div>One thing I noticed with the use of the thin and long strips of decal, it's like there's some static attraction between the sticker and the ABS that makes it go down quickly even when you're not yet in the right position so that I often end up removing it again and again, which in turn makes it curl up. It also makes &nbsp;smudges on the plastic, so that if it remains exposed, it attracts dirt and dust.</div><div><br></div><div>Clutch power for the parts is still pretty good.</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly, the heavy build may have some effect on the acceleration with the motor, as the vehicle comes to an abrupt stop once the coil of the string is used up (though I really don't know what it looks like inside, if there really is a coiled spring, as I have no plans of dissecting it...maybe someone else is crazy enough to do so).</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is still a nice truck to have and a great addition to the set. Its definitely worth buying.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for viewing. PLAY WELL!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
