"Javert24601","2012-11-03T19:19:34.88Z","This is no ordinary minifigure, THIS IS AN URUK HAI!","After chasing down 8 copies of this set I decided I'd get down to business and review one, if not all of them (This review won't have pictures like the last time as I don't have a camera to take them on :/ )<br><br>Anyway onto the review.<br><br><b>The Packaging</b><br><br>Just like all other promotional sets, the packaging is just a printed polybag. &nbsp;I love how Helms Deep can be seen in the background, because Helms deep is the soul purpose for building an army of these! To attack the fortress! &nbsp;The Set Number is printed under the 6-12, outlining the age this pack is meant for? (<i>What's that? Did you just say I'm too old for LEGO?</i>) Anyway your normal packaging front applies (the top with The Lord of the Rings and Sauron's finger along with the lego logo. &nbsp;On the back there is nothing special apart from the usual warning don't give to 3 yr olds, this pack is recycleable (<i>nothing that says DON'T STICK THIS PACKET TO THE WALL FOR DISPLAY...</i>)&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Instructions</b><br><br>Again, just like in all other polybag/promo sets, the instructions are tiny but are very clear and get straight to the point. (no idea why you build the Uruk last though) Also on the backside of the instructions is a very nice promo for the Helms Deep set (<i>as I have 8 of these leaflets, one WILL be going on the wall</i>) &nbsp;There are 6 steps of building which are very easy.<br><br><b>The Build/Parts</b><br><br>This set features a couple of common and a couple of lesser common pieces, and of course a piece that is exclusive to the Lord of the Rings Liscensed Theme (The Uruk Hai Helmet). &nbsp;Not bad for 21 pieces, plus you get a very nice Halberd, which brings me memories of the Knight's Kingdom sets from way back with King Leo's Castle and Bull's attack and things like that. The build is very straightforward that anyone could do it with their eyes closed (<i>well, I can anyway, just by feeling the bits.</i>) &nbsp;<br><br><b>The Minifigure<br></b><br>This figure is lovely! It really looks like an Uruk from the Two Towers film and I love the way lego had represented it! The helmet is lovely, and the head has two sides, so you can decide which face to put under the helmet, looking on into the battle. &nbsp;One has a sort of very fierce expression, the other has a snarling type of expression. &nbsp;The printing of the torso is very nice, but is covered up by the chest armour, it also features back printing. The legs also feature printing. &nbsp;This is the feature of the set, as everyone wants it for the Uruk (to be fair, I like the ballista, but it's not very sophisticated, but then again why would it be when it's only a promo set. oh and the flick fire on the ballista works well.<br><br><b>Overall</b><br><br>The set is very nice, the perfect army builder and good if you like flickfire missles... now if you decided to get as many as I did (10) then to me that's a great start, but 10,000? That's far too many!<br><br>Ratings<br><br>KFOL - 6/10, it's a LOTR set, not many KFOLs will have seen it<br><br>TFOL - 10/10, a gem of a little set for collectors like me<br><br>AFOL - 10/10, again a gem of a little set for others too, and of course the perfect set to army build if you can!<br><br>I really hope this review wasn't boring without the pictures, I promise that I shall review Frodo's Cooking Corner (hopefully) with pictures, as that is how I like to review these things, I hope this review was helpful to you!<br><br>Thanks again for reading!",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5
"arl100","2012-11-07T13:56:53.913Z","Saruman had to start somewhere","<p>Didn't fancy queuing behind loads of people at my local WHS, so managed to pick these up cheaply on eBay (if you look, they are out there well priced). The set itself is OK, a little ballista with LEGO's famous 'flick-fire missile', but the Uruk-Hai was the sole reason I bought this. Arguably the cheapest army builder, this is my first set for the Lord of the Rings (after deciding Star Wars was getting too samey and too expensive). </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Uruk-Hai for not a lot</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Cheap ones will soon disappear</li><li>Better with the Uruk sword &amp; shield</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Overall, a good promo, but find it cheaply or just buy the Uruk separate if that is all you are after. A good find for not a lot of money, and a quick and easy way to build an army.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-11-22T12:27:26.09Z","Hai Versatility","<p>Through promotions this little&nbsp;polybag&nbsp;provides one&nbsp;Uruk&nbsp;Hai character with his spear firing&nbsp;ballista&nbsp;for the Lord of the Rings theme and and is a tiny but highly attractive little set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure&nbsp;Score</strong><br />
<strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>High quality prints.</li>
	<li>Dark metallic&nbsp;armour.</li>
	<li>Double faced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Star of the set, a superbly&nbsp;armoured&nbsp;warrior, he (can they be she?) gets dark metallic plate&nbsp;armour&nbsp;including a massive cumbersome helmet and long halberd or axe. The double faced &#39;angry&#39; or &#39;very angry&#39; expressions provides some comedy and variety. The prints are outstanding on back and front of the torso with leather straps, buckles, studs and&nbsp;armour&nbsp;in brown, grey, black and silver. The faces likewise have are superbly yellow eyed and have alternative appearances, one with the white&nbsp;Saruman&nbsp;face paint job.&nbsp;Saruman&nbsp;also does storytelling and puppet&nbsp;theatre&nbsp;for his&nbsp;favoured&nbsp;warriors. Those maroon/ dark red arms are a great contrast. The whole look represents the characters brilliantly and not up for true film likenesses, I prefer Lego&#39;s own twist on reproduction especially for what was a book and interpretative. The gloves finish the MF for me unless they are supposed to be&nbsp;skanksome&nbsp;hands?<br />
<br />
<strong>Ballista&nbsp;Bonanza</strong><br />
Now many people were after a ton of these sets for the army building quality. The&nbsp;ballista&nbsp;is superb... maybe I don&#39;t get out much but when I first flick fired it I was surprised and impressed at the power and distance for a free tiny construction toy from the front of a paper. A simple but clever design all round.<br />
<br />
So maybe you got a ton of these and have happily lined them up in army formation.&nbsp;Thats&nbsp;great but if they all have&nbsp;ballistas, they can not all charge in to Helms Deep. What we need is some variety in the form of alternative building! Lets see what this tiny brick inventory can offer up then.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Building</strong><br />

<br />
[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8209162708_9df7811002.jpg[/img]Other&nbsp;orcs&nbsp;can join in by pushing on those handles, if only there was a flame to light his torch.<br />
<br />
[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8208071943_bc2d2de610.jpg[/img]Things get silly now as our&nbsp;Uruk&nbsp;Hai crawls under a shelter to cook up a meal in his pot and get changed in some privacy.<br />
<br />
[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8348/8209162166_bce84b79fa.jpg[/img]Crawling under his tent from the Helm&#39;s Deep rain seems a better option while his&nbsp;armour&nbsp;and kit hangs outside for a wash.<br />

<br />
[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8208071025_5df9d1b243.jpg[/img]Again seeking a flame for that blessed torch, perhaps the cover of darkness is best suited for this one Orc boat with its tiny sail. I&#39;m sure where wind is absent the average&nbsp;Uruk&nbsp;can make his own, at least those ramming spikes look the part. Don&#39;t laugh, its the height of&nbsp;Uruk&nbsp;Hai chic!<br />
<br />
[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8209161194_a6a69c42db.jpg[/img]Back in line with the &#39;armoury&nbsp;in a&nbsp;polybag&#39; review, this bloke has built a catapult! Just make sure he stands on it to help weigh it down!<br />

<br />
I look forward to do more alternative builds in future, variety always being a good thing when we all own the same sets. I would never have guessed the amount of different models one could get out if this&nbsp;polybag&nbsp;(including the shamelessly dodgy ones!) until I tried. I&#39;m so glad to have got it and I bet Frodo can&#39;t do half as much with that oven!<br />

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-22T20:27:50.083Z","Build me an Army!","<p>Set #30211 Uruk Hai with Ballista: As far as polybags go this is one of the better offerings out there, even if it is a real pain to get your hands on it.</p>
<p>The Uruk Hai with Ballista is great for army building, it comes with the standard looking Uruk Hai Mini-Figure, complete with double-sided print on the torso and head, with hand of Saruman markings on one side and clean the other. As well as a large Castle era axe as a weapon and the nifty new helmet piece, plus torso armor piece.</p>
<p>The microbuild Ballista is rather small, and used primarily to pad up the piece count&nbsp;I believe, the weapon itself is nice as a set piece, and multiples will really add to your Battle of Helms Deep, complete with flick-fire missiles for added playability. If you can manage to get more than one you'll get your money's worth, in-spite of the small piece count. Still haven't seen any around at TRU Canada, fortunately it was given away free with purchase of 30$ worth of LEGO LotR at the beginning of the month so I did manage to get the one. Hopefully I'll be able to army build it to the maximum of five for a good solid number of Uruk to add to Helm's Deep.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that LEGO made some great choices with LotR and Hobbit Polybags, while the Frodo with Cooking Corner Polybag is a bit of wasted potential, this Uruk is great for army building and well worth tracking down. Strongly reccomended.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"Ernst","2012-12-25T15:36:28.05Z","No mercy !! The Era of the Human has ended !!","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : Great little set that mostly will be used as Army builder. It comes in a polybag and is very complete, standing alone not too&nbsp;playable but combined a great addition to your Uruk Hai army. Affordable so in reach for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> :&nbsp;The same as in&nbsp;set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=45479"">30210</a> not too hard to built, the assembling of the Uruk Hai and the built of the small balista. So here also three bricks.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> :&nbsp;Good parts used for the balista but most points for the Uruk Hai warrior. I would love to trade the body armour that covers the great print on the torso for a Uruk Hai sword. Both torso (front and backside)&nbsp;and legs have a great print and the head&nbsp;is printed on both sides with a frightening grinn. Awesome helmet and a familiar halberd as weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 3 bricks</strong> : Standing alone not much playing fun, combined with other LotR sets a lot so an average of 3 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;5&nbsp;bricks</strong> : I bought this set together 30210 for &euro; 6,50 each which I think it is definitely a&nbsp;reasonable price considering its content. If you keep it sealed the value will definitely rise in the near future. Even more than 30210 because this one will be opened more than the Frodo polybag because of&nbsp;the Uruk Hai&#39;s use as army builder.</p>

"Telcontar","2013-03-23T15:55:13.817Z","Yea!  More Uruk-hai!","<p>Now we can finally help&nbsp;make the ratio of good guys to bad guys more accurate.&nbsp; Of course, to do that for a scene like Helm&#39;s Deep it&#39;d take a <em>lot </em>of these little polybags.&nbsp; But every bit helps.:-)</p>

<p>The main part of this poly is, of course, the minifig.&nbsp; He&#39;s the same one we get in other sets (Helm&#39;s Deep and the Uruk-hai army) and like the others he is fantastic.&nbsp; The printing is phenomenal.&nbsp; If only he came with a sword and shield instead of the pike, oh well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ballista is pretty cool.&nbsp; Small, but good for a polybag.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t really look fitting when you put it by Helm&#39;s Deep though.&nbsp; The pieces on the sides (by themselves they look like robot arms) are useful for holding on to it.&nbsp; Then with the other hand you &quot;flick&quot; the missile.&nbsp; It goes much farther than you might expect (perhaps my expectations were too low).&nbsp; Last but not least, more hinge pieces are always nice additions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally collect polybags, but I really like this one, expensive as it is.&nbsp; I got it a Five Below for $4.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend it to any LotR fan (and/or completest) as well as anybody trying to build a bigger Uruk-hai army.</p>
