Do not expect to get a silver grill for the front of this car, it's all black. I also think the front two wheels are too close together.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Zombie Driver, love the zombies.<br></li><li>It's cheap.<br>Great for kids, not many pieces.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Different pieces than displayed.<br></li><li>Looks very basic, poorly made.<br></li></ul>
<p><br>So overall, if you're looking for a zombie figure for 40p, this is your best bet. If you want a coffin car though, build you own.<br></p>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-11-09T22:15:01.123Z","Pay your Chauffeur in Brains...","<p>Set # 30200 Zombie Chauffeur Coffin Car: Monster Fighters is a fun new Theme for this year of LEGO, it introduces a new play pattern and a brand new collection of characters in the spirit of such Themes as Pharaoh's Quest, Atlantis, Adventurers and others. Many of the sets are great, frightening looking builds designed to incorporate a sort of steampunk look to the world of LEGO. Then there is this Polybagged set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can be said of the Zombie Chauffeur? While it is true this Mini-Figure is included in three seperate sets, two of them Polybags, he's still a great looking Mini-Fig. Incorporating ideas first proposed with the CMF Zombie from Series 1 and expanding upon it, this Mini-Fig has a gruesome looking print on his torso and legs, he's dressed in a dark blue Chauffeurs uniform with tears and rips showing the decaying flesh underneath. There is even backprinting with another tear in his uniform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I particularly like the facial expression, grim gritting teeth in a decayed looking visage with milky white eyes, even a broken tooth. Plus he's wearing one glove and a hat, suitably spine chilling, though at the same time cute in LEGO form. I truly dig the Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model however... I must be honest, as far as polybagged sets go there are good models and then there are bad models, sometimes the bad models have decent parts or redeeming qualities. The Coffin Car does have a nice looking piece, a black coffin, sadly it doesn't include the lid. It also includes a grille piece to indicate that this is meant to be a car, in a way it sort of reminds me of the Dragula from the classic television series the Munsters. And with a few extra steps to the build it might have even been perfect, I just can't find much in the way to recommend this model outside of the cheap way to get the Zombie Chauffeur. There's also the matter of the rear wheels falling off due to fragility of the build, for a kid playing with this thing will be a constant battle against potentially losing the rear wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I can't fault LEGO for trying with this one, some of the design and aspects of this set are quite intriguing and, had they taken things a step or two further, it could have been on par with other Polybagged sets from other Themes. However, unless you're a completist or can't afford the Vampyre Hearse there's really no other reasons for buying this set. Unless you're looking for a cheap method of army building Zombie heads.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
"Hobie819","2012-12-28T14:58:54.017Z","Stumbled when it could have been fantastic","<p>I have to agree with <span class=""fn"">Odeinoichus's review below. While you can easily modify the set to be sturdy and playable, the entire point is that you shouldn't have to modify the set to make it that way. Many of the pieces in this set are put on in a very fragile way. The coffin is nice and having a cheap zombie is nice but ultimately there isn't many redeemable qualities about the set itself.</span></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Cheap Zombie</li><li>Coffin</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Falls apart easily with any amount of play (wheels came off 3 times in about 5 minutes of play with my 4 year old son, front end fell off twice in 10 minutes)</li><li>Ultimately isn't very playable. A zombie car is cool but there isn't room for passengers so having a chauffuer defeats the purpose</li><li>The model itself when put together is just - lacking for a lack of a better word.</li></ul>
<p>I think the idea could have been fantastic but the implementation was badly flawed. For an extra 2 or 3 dollars in parts the model could have been built well and served its' purpose but in order to keep the price down to pollybag price it was skimped on and suffered because of it.&nbsp; I'd buy it again for the price but will always wish it could have lived to it's full potential out of the bag instead of having to mod it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,4
"chrisbstm","2012-12-04T12:06:40.883Z","Zombies? Awesome.","I managed to track two of these down at my local TRU, and I was extremely excited. Coffins are always a good piece to have, and the grille piece that it comes with also was pretty cool. I read in another review that the back wheels came off too easily, but I managed to overcome this problem by converting my ""car"" into a dragster with some extra parts I had laying around. Overall, I thinks this is an excellent buy, great way to get zombies and coffins.",FALSE,4,5,3,4,4
"exorallan31","2022-11-02T21:54:02.353Z","Alright Polybag","<p>My first polybag review, 30200 Zombie chauffeur coffin car.</p>

<p>For the figure we have a Zombie Driver, a good minifigure and was probably the best reason to get this polybag in 2012.</p>

<p>Building experience - Not much as it&#39;s a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the parts there is some good stuff here, Coffin base, Wheel holder, Grille, Steering wheel, Megaphone, and some flames.</p>

<p>The model is not much. It&#39;s a fun idea and good if you want to spice up your Haloween display.</p>

<p>So overall not much here, Good figure, good pieces and decent to spice up your Haloween display a little.</p>
