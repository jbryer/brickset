These LEGO coasters don't slip or slide. They stay in place under cups and glasses, and the cups and glasses stay in place on top of them. The LEGO coasters are also larger than most other coasters I've used, so they can fit under large drinking cups/pitchers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Toa-Of-Justice/LEGO-Coasters-Review/02_cup_on_coaster.jpg[/img]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At first, I thought I was supposed to use these LEGO coasters ""studs-up,"" like in the&nbsp;official product picture, but after realizing that other coasters have liquid-catching rings/rims, I flipped over one of these coasters and discovered such rings on the bottom. I suppose the coaster could be used either way, but for best results, I recommend using the bottom of the coaster rather than the studded top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Toa-Of-Justice/LEGO-Coasters-Review/01_both_sides.jpg[/img]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an added bonus, since these LEGO coasters grip so well and are made of flexible silicone, they can also be used as jar/bottle openers!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet another bonus: Some LEGO elements&nbsp;CAN connect with these coasters, such as minifig cups (upside-down on the studs) and thin bar elements (in the holes on the bottom).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Toa-Of-Justice/LEGO-Coasters-Review/03_lego_cup_on_coaster.jpg[/img]</p><p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Toa-Of-Justice/LEGO-Coasters-Review/04_lego_bar_on_coaster.jpg[/img]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I'd highly recommend these coasters.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
