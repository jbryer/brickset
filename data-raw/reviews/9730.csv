Also with same head graphics from printed record piece) and the torso graphic and jeans look good.</div><div><b>CONQUISTADOR - </b>Looks great with pearl gold helmet and armor. Stand out printing on the armor and legs. Great for army building.</div><div><b>SANTA CLAUSE - </b>Has<b>&nbsp;</b>new cap and all new sack element. Wish they gave him black boots though. A vast improvement from previous Lego Santa's.</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7832544366_2d2e9607eb.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>FEMALE SKIER </b>- Nice jacket/torso graphics and I like that they have white boot graphics on the legs.</div><div><b>MAN-BAT</b> - Fun and in black unlike the brown one (this one has different face and torso graphics) from the Monster Fighters series. Those new arm/wing pieces are fabulous!</div><div><b>BAVARIAN</b> - Nice graphics for the lederhosen, love the new pretzel element and you get an extra plume piece (could use that as a quill pen).</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8443/7832542488_0eed1b5339.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>PIRATE CAPTAIN</b> - Looks great and love the gold toned Jolly Roger on his bicorn hat. Comes with pearl gold sword and hook.</div><div><div><b>COWGIRL</b> - <i>(Note there is a star on her cowboy hat that got washed out in the photo).</i> The hat is new with hair in a pony-tail attached. Nice new graphics on the torso and legs. Same lasso as Wonder Woman but here in rope brown.</div><div><b>BUSINESS MAN</b> - Looks like he's from the 20's or 30's with a new tile graphic that reads City Financial News and a briefcase. Kinda' a meh figure but like the bowler hat in black (new color for this piece I believe).</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8447/7832540948_4144b3efcc.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>ALIEN WARRIOR QUEEN</b> - Obviously an addition to the Alien Conquest line with same sculpted face/head as the Alien Commander but here they added eye-lash graphics above each eye and an upper-lip in red lipstick graphic. The transparent brain is the same from the AC series as well but instead of a trans-green color we have trans-magenta/lavender. Nice touch on her belt graphic with the little flying saucer w/tractor beam. Comes with retro laser pistol (we've seen many times before) and note cape and collar are in two parts.</div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7832703342_5a854c58c5.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>ROBOT WARRIOR</b> - Excellent graphics on the torso and legs (great detailing)! Customizers are gonna' have fun with this figure. Same helmet as the Robot from Series 1 CMF but here it's a dark grey instead of the previous light grey. Comes with retro laster pistol and short light saber piece. Again, another great army builder.</div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8305/7832700906_1e23de77f6.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><i>Helmet really covers up some nice face graphics. Wish they had made a new helm for this fig. to show off his excellent face print better.</i></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8444/7832698360_3eefc98a6c.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>FAIRY</b> - Pretty figure w/trans-pink Wand, light green skirt and wonderful new wing piece(see next photo for better look of the wing piece).</div><div><b>SHAKESPEARE</b> - Duel face (see next photo), nicely detailed torso and legs, ruffle neck piece (all new) and of course the skull of Yorick!</div></div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8314/7909152362_a9b76284c3.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><div><i>Below...FAIRY - Better look at the new wing element. A frosted like transparency and is flexible. Also, of note the skirt seems to reveal the Fairy's posterior...;) Perhaps I put it on wrong?</i></div><div><i>SHAKESPEARE - His duel 'frightened-look' face.</i></div></div><div><i><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7909150824_4b66a86bf0.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div></i></div><div><div><b>FOOTBALL PLAYER</b> - Similar helmet and shoulder pad/armor like the Hockey Player from Series 4. Has a good look and nice touch on the face with 'eye black' graphic. Comes with a pearl gold trophy. Really wish Lego would've come up with a football element to fit in hand. He looks great and is good for team building (with everyone being #12 though) but needs that football to really complete the look.</div><div><b>CHEERLEADER </b>- A red version of the previous Cheerleader from series 1 but w/black wig, red topped pom-poms, and overall silghtly different graphics on body and legs (most notable is the 'A' and face).</div></div><div><i><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8038/7909149254_52494585f2.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div></i><b>DEEP SEA DIVER</b>&nbsp;- Wonderful new bell jar helmet piece(!) with the face plate being a magnifying glass (shows off the giddy explorer). Great torso graphics front and back and besides his harpoon they put in 1x1 plates acting as weighted shoes (good touch).</div><div><div>[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8459/7909147588_4e77635aa4.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>I for one am not tired of the Collectable Minifigures. They are always a treat with new elements, colors and characters! <b><i>Keep 'em coming Lego.</i></b>..BUT, space 'em out more...I feel right after Halloween should be one wave (nice to collect and have for stocking stuffers at Christmas time) and the other around May (school's ending and a pre-summer treat for the kids).</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,3
