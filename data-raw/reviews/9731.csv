The display is nice and clear, and is very easy to set. The backlight, activated by knocking Boba's head, is a pleasing green in keeping with the Fett-ish&nbsp;colour scheme. The alarm is excellent, gradually rising from a very quiet beep to a mad&nbsp;cacophony, rewarding you if you hit it early enough and rousing you if you need it to. And the best feature is that tapping his head is how you snooze him for 5 minutes, but to turn him off you have to be concious enough to flick a small switch on his back - it's so dangerous when alarms can easily be turned off accidentally, but there's no chance of that here. (The snooze symbol even flashes along with the : that marks the seconds while the snooze is active.)</p><p>As for the figure, he's a huge (5:1 scale I believe) version of the Boba Fett minifigure! He's the 2010 Slave I (8097) incarnation, so not as up to date as he could have been. But that was when he got a decent helmet that hasn't been improved upon yet, and he's only missing really the leg printing of the 2012 desert skiff (9496) version.<br>He's fully poseable, although I doubt you can pair him with all that much (I'd love it if he fitted with the storage boxes, but I think he's too small for that). The leg joints seem a bit loose, but I think it's just that they move freely, and they do hold position so it's not a problem.<br>I've given him average marks for building and parts because there's no N/A option and 1/5 seemed harsh! The only part he comes with is the antenna scanner for his helmet, which can be moved down in front of his visor as it does when he's piloting Slave I, and it's pretty simple to attach! Incidentally, he was rather fiercely attached to his packaging with thick string ties, so it was a challenge to get him fully out of the box.<br>The only real disappointment is that he doesn't have a weapon and somehow looks a little un-Fett-like without one.</p><p>Pros</p>
<ul><li>You've got a five-times-the-size Boba Fett minifigure! How cool!</li><li>He's fully poseable</li><li>The clock is simple to set and use...</li><li>... yet does everything you need very well</li><li>You can't turn the alarm off by mistake</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No gun! Such a shame. No cape or jet-pack either, but the gun is the real miss</li></ul>
<p>I love him! He does everything I need an alarm clock to do very well, which is something a lot of alarm clocks somehow fail to do! For a simple clock it has a lot of very nice touches, like the swelling alarm, and intuitive clock setting and snoozing. And in terms of the figure he's an excellent blown up version of the best minifigure version (give or take a little leg printing!), I think he's excellent and only wish that he came with a blaster.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
