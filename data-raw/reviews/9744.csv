Admit it, the prequel wasn't very impressive.&nbsp; The Complete Saga, Indianna Jones 1 and 2, they'd beat it easily.&nbsp; So why is the sequel so great? It makes history in Lego's gaming for two reasons, the second being more important:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;The minifigures talk of course! From the videos to the actual gameplay, minifigures no longer grunt, snort, and laugh.&nbsp; Words enable Lego to create a much deeper plot and moral.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Batman 2 is the first ever&nbsp;Lego sandbox game.&nbsp; For you who aren't large gamers, sandbox means the levels are intertwined into a large world, which the game focuses on.&nbsp; In this case, Gotham City is that very, <em>very</em> large world.&nbsp; It is ginormous and extremely detailed, full of cars to hijack, street criminals to fight, and obstacles courses.&nbsp; If you haven't played a sandobx game before, Batman 2 will come as a shock to you.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>- Gotham City is the biggest pro.&nbsp; It's literally stuffed with things to do.&nbsp; You will find activities, such as racing go-karts in a parking lot, that get you red and gold bricks.&nbsp; Throughout levels and Gotham City, there are citizens that need saving.&nbsp; From being stuck in a flower's mouth to being surrounding by hoodlums, citizens everywhere must be saved.&nbsp; To beat the game, you have to find all of them.&nbsp; Landmarks also make the gameplay interseting, along with villians you must fight and defeat to buy.</p><p>- This one should've been in the previous pro, but it's so fun I just had to put it seperate.&nbsp; Obstacle courses! They swarm through the zoo, up the skyscrapers, and&nbsp;across the streets.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;tons of them, all which vary&nbsp;to keep you entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you see one of the platforms that switch your outfit in Gotham City, that means there's an&nbsp;obstacle course nearby.</p><p>-&nbsp;If you've played Batman 1, you'll know of the cool suits that are required to&nbsp;pass levels.&nbsp; Batman 2 keeps&nbsp;some of the old ones,&nbsp;but adds really sweet new ones.&nbsp; I'll&nbsp;keep it a suprise by&nbsp;only telling you two&nbsp;of the new ones: an acrobat suit&nbsp;with a built in vehicle (Robin's coolest), and a power suit the fires missiles (one of Batman's coolest).&nbsp;</p><p>- You can save your progress inbetween levels (excluding the vehicle levels).</p><p>- It's much more challenging than Lego's previous release, Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>- You can be tons of DC comic characters... if only it was Marvel.</p><p>- Tons of playability! Never gets boring.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>- With such a large game, glitches must be expected.&nbsp; Some are actually good; if you're playing hide and seek with a friend (I would suggest it because you have a full size city to hide in!), there are special spots that shouldn't exist: pipes to slip down, crevices inbetween buildings, openings in minifigure statues, etc.</p><p>- Gotham City is divided into three sections: the top, which has free growning plants, Wayne Mansion, the creepy circus; the middle, which has Gotham park, and looks more like a traditional big city; and the bottom, which has Wayne Tower, and is much more high tech.&nbsp; Why is that bad? Well, the PC version is <em>not</em> divided in three sections.&nbsp; Not only this, but on a computer there are words on posters and activities, it's HD, and is even more detailed.&nbsp; For this reason, I&nbsp;say<strong> buy the PC version instead</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>- While a moral was added, it seems forced and is actually kind of pointless.</p><p>- It's really silly.&nbsp; I know all the Lego games are, but this one was overkill.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Batman 2 is worth buying, even if it's a bit more expensive than your average Lego videogame.  But wait! you say.&nbsp;Lego Universe had all these things, so why wasn't it a success?&nbsp; Well, that's a different&nbsp;story, but I can promise you the Batman 2 will not fail or dissapoint.&nbsp; </p><p>With all these new features, it just gets me more exicted about the upcoming video game that may be Lego's best yet: Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; Let's hope they learn from the mistakes and success of Batman 2.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-27T13:16:02.4Z","Up, Up and Away! Voice Acting comes to LEGO Games","<p>Set #5001095 Batman 2: DC Super Heroes for Wii: This was the first LEGO game to introduce voice work and by far it is really quite fun. As LEGO games go you can't go wrong with Super Heroes.</p>
<p>This is a fun game for all ages, allowing you to play through a connected story that features tons of brand new playable characters, including the Justice League, Lex Luthor and several brand new Gotham Villains, alongside such classics as Zod the Kryptonian General and Sinestro. There are however certain problems with this game compared to the original LEGO Batman game, or rather changes I should say.</p>
<p>For the most part the Game includes a lengthy play time, with a large brand new Gotham Hubworld to explore and solve puzzles in to unlock hidden bonuses and cheats. (Or Characters) That being said, while the hubworld is quite expansive there are certain areas notable for game breaking glitches. The most noteable of which I've discovered so far is the Gotham Boardwalk Fair area, some of the rides won't trigger and the game froze up on me with the dreaded screen whine when I had some of my cheats activated and played around the area.</p>
<p>There are fifteen chapters in this game, if I haven't forgotten, and while that is the same number of chapters found in the original LEGO Batman game for the Hero side, there is no Villain Equivalent to play through, making the game a bit shorter. The inclusion of animated cut scenes with actual original dialogue and in-deed the dialogue found throughout the stages as well is a welcome change to the franchise. Instead of just imagining what's going on you get a whole new take on the humour of the LEGO universe. It helps that the voice actors do a bang up job and some of them are quite familiar, Lex Luthor is being voiced by the same actor who performed the role on the Justice League and Superman Animated Series cartoon shows.</p>
<p>With new characters come's new types of gameplay, instead of just using Batman's suits you can now adopt the powers of Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman and Superman. Superman alone is worth the price of the game, not only do you get to fly, use his super breath and heat vision as well as become invulnerable to anyone in the game who isn't using Kryptonite, but in the Hubworld whenever you soar through the skies of Gotham the classic John Williams Theme plays everytime. I could just spend hours flying around listening to that Theme and enjoy myself, it never get's old.</p>
<p>Overall I really think this is a great step forward for the LEGO Games Franchises and the Super Heroes one in particular, introducing a brand new story instead of simply rehashing established adventures like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and even The Lord of the Rings opens up a world of possibilities and whacky new DC Characters. Here's hoping that when the Marvel Super Heroes game comes out we aren't simply treated to a re-telling of Avengers or the other Marvel Series Films. Highly recommend this game, however be aware that familiar glitches are abound when certain cheats are activated, going back to debug certain issues like that would really help Traveller's Tales a long way in the LEGO Game making business.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
