I wanted a Gollum minifig but I wasn't that impressed with the Shelob Attacks set. It is nice to be able to get him in a set that costs only $10. The set has 105 pieces and two minifigs for $9.99 in the U.S., which I think makes it a great value. I was expecting it to cost the same price as the Gandalf Arrives set but was&nbsp;pleasantly&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;when it cost less than that.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/zaxIx.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span>The front of the box.</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/jm7oG.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>The back of the box.

"Thunderkhan","2012-12-31T01:46:54.733Z","Better than expected.","<p>This set was, for me, a surprisingly good set. When I first saw it, I was not too impressed with just a chunk of rock and a couple of minifigs. But the longer I have it, the more I like it. It's quite nice.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is small, not much room for the pieces to move around in. On the back are pictures showing all of the functions of it. The instructions are in a very pleasing format,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;with the background. They were easy to follow and there were no mistakes that I saw. At the end are pictures of the set and what it can do.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>There are 105 pieces. With two of them being minifigs it's decent price at $10. It comes with two rings, instead of three like the previous lotr sets. It has four dark brown pieces for Gollum's boat. Mainly, this set is chuck full of gray slopes. Mostly 1x2x3 dark gray slopes with&nbsp;several&nbsp;gray cheese slopes. Also a scattering of tan pieces and two black hinges, and a few&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;pieces for the function. There are 8 extra pieces.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The minifigures are superb. Bilbo has double sided printing on both his torso and his head, the two expressions being scared and a kind of worried look. His torso is new, and he has a sword. Gollum is the same as in other sets but with a more sinister expression. He has been given a fish to hold. Both are unique to this set.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build was fairly straightforward. Gollum's boat is just a quick click together and the rock is just some slope stacking. It only took me about 10 minutes. The only interesting part is the Technic function it has, which allows the ring to be hidden and revealed, and the hinges, which make it so the rocks hiding the ring can be moved aside and positioned differently.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>While Gollum's boat is a bit of a&nbsp;disappointment, the rock itself makes up for it. It is very nicely textured and the hinges and the ring function are a nice addition which give it a amount of playability. It looks very good on display, especially as a desk ornament.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This set is better than it looks on the box. It depicts the riddle scene of The Hobbit well with the natural looking rock and the bones on Gollum's boat. With two minifigs $10 is a good price. However, it is quite small and there is not a lot of piece&nbsp;diversity. If you have $10 on hand, buy it, but there are better sets to save up for.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-08T13:40:19.44Z","'Why Don't We Have a Game of... Riddles?'","<p>Set #79000 Riddles for the Ring: The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey has been in theatres for a few weeks now and it seems that there are many who have enjoyed the picture. Have they enjoyed it enough to also enjoy the LEGO Hobbit sets? And is this set one worth picking up? Read on to find out...</p>
<p>Riddles for the Ring costs 12.99$, it features two Mini-Figures and two main Elements/Models at a low price, this is an iconic scene in the film, a return of a favorite character for some and the first moment where Tolkien knew he was going to take us on a truly epic adventure and journey. Because it introduces us for the first time to 'The Ring'. What does this set do to recapture this moment?</p>
<p>Well first of all you get the pieces to build a large rocky set piece, the same set piece seen in the film. Where Bilbo and Gollum dance around one nervously, the other eagerly in hopes of winning the game of riddles. This model uses most of the pieces and, quite honestly doesn't do much besides representing a set piece. Two of the sections are built on small hinges, so they can close or open at an angle for display. Another piece of the model includes, as a play feature, a moveable holding spot for the ring. The design is meant to allow you, while playing with the set, to twist a knob and 'reveal' the Ring to Bilbo for when he finds it. Not very accurate to what happened on screen, but it is meant to add play to an otherwise dull little rock model.</p>
<p>Gollum's little boat is much more interesting looking as far as models go, even if it doesn't use too many pieces and doesn't offer much in the way of play, it's still a nice little model. Because it does have a few unique pieces, for one thing you get two of the Skulkin arms from LEGO Ninjago and a bone piece, the small kind given to LEGO City dogs, in the set you also get an extra bone and Skulkin arm, pieces that might prove useful for MOCing and such.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are greatly detailed, Bilbo Baggins isn't unique to this set, he's seen in other Hobbit sets. This is the more common Mini-Figure, with a double-sided torso print in rich red tones for his jacket. On the Mini-Figure the jacket is wide open, revealing a green undershirt and nekerchief, as we all know however in the actual film this version of Bilbo should have had his buttons done up. He's a shorty, with the shorter Mini-Fig legs in light tan color, he also has a double-sided head, with a frightened expression and a more neutral one. The hairpiece, is probably not entirely new, as other Hobbits may have used it before, this color is a light reddish tone. Almost Ron Weasely orange really, from the original yellow skinned Ron Mini-Figure in the older Harry Potter sets. Bilbo also has the One Ring and Sting, which are both great pieces and this is the cheapest set so far out of all the LotR/Hobbit Themed sets to include both accessories, in fact you get two of each. (I gave my doubles to Frodo from the Frodo with Cooking Corner Polybag.)</p>
<p>Gollum is slightly different from this set as he appeared in the Shelob Attacks set from LotR, mostly with the fine details printed on his face and head, the scraggily bits of hair, he only has seven teeth though we do know he's meant to have only nine left. Gollum is a unique Mini-Figure in that he is a singular sculpted piece, with only the arms that move, honestly this is an interesting looking Mini-Figure design even if the piece can only be used as Gollum/Smeagol and nobody else. You can also use the stud on his back to attach things to him, and, despite not having one in the scene, he's carrying a fish. (So juicy sweet.)</p>
<p>Overall, this isn't a bad little set, the parts are pretty much good for MOCing if you'd like, the Mini-Figures unfortuantely aren't that unique, while Gollum in this set looks a bit nicer I can't really compare him as I have yet to pick up Shelob Attacks. The fact that you get two Stings and two Rings in this set is a nice bonus, that being said I think it's safe to skip this one unless you really want this version of Gollum or, like me, want to complete to 100% the entire LotR/Hobbit theme of LEGO.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3
"lkb57","2014-02-13T18:59:24.43Z","More Fun than a Game of Riddles!","<p>Lego has delivered a spot-on interpretation of what is perhaps the most famous scene from <em>The Hobbit</em>. Not only is this a fun little set in it&#39;s own right, but it&#39;s also a cheap way to get both Bilbo Baggins and Gollum. What&#39;s more, despite this being a small set, it packs in a surprising amount of playability.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too special here, unless you&#39;re a casle MOC-er, then the large numbers of gray slopes will come in handy for rock building and what-not. As usual, Bilbo&#39;s sword Sting and the ring are welcome minifig accessories.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gollum is unique to this set, though it&#39;s a little hard to tell. This Gollum has &quot;narrow eyes&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;wide eyes&quot; Gollum that comes in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9470-1/Shelob-Attacks"">9470: Shelob Attacks</a>. I really like the Gollum minifigure&ndash;&ndash;the printing on his face is perfect&ndash;&ndash;except for one small detail: his arms pop off way too easily. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not sure how the TLC could have done things differently . . . but having to constantly reattach the little guy&#39;s arms does get old.</p>

<p>The Bilbo minifigure is not unique, but he is a great little minifig, and as I mentioned above, this is definitely the cheapest way to get your hands on him (unless you buy him second-hand, I suppose). His face is double-printed with a serious/scared expression, and his torso is also printed front and back with his awesome little hobbit jacket.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick, but surprisingly fun. The main structure&ndash;&ndash;a pile of rocks&ndash;&ndash;has a hidden compartment that flips down to reveal the Ring. I will say that despite the small number of pieces, TLC did a good job of making a natural-looking rock outcrop. Gollum&#39;s boat is a quick and easy build but it definitely enhances the playability of the entire set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In short, this set is a no-brainer: go and buy it quick! You get two amazing minifigs, and the average price-per is actually a little below the 10 cents per piece threshold. My one and only complaint is that the set didn&#39;t include a goblin. In the movie (though not in the book), both Bilbo and the goblin tumble down into Gollum&#39;s domain. Currently, the only way to get your hands on a goblin minifig is to buy the expensive <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79010-1/The-Goblin-King-Battle"">79010: The Goblin King Battle</a>. It would have been nice to have a cheaper option, and I would have been willing to pay a little more for it.</p>

"ra226","2014-05-25T08:43:48.84Z","The One Ring, Bilbo, Gollum, and The One Ring!","<p>This little set is an excellent way to grab Bilbo, Gollum, and The One Ring, along with a few, nice set pieces to backdrop what&#39;s probably the most famous scene in the whole Hobbit trilogy.</p>

<p>The primary attraction of this set is clearly the minifigs, but Gollum&#39;s little boat and the stone formation help to complete the vignette. &nbsp;There&#39;s an odd &quot;playability&quot; feature that swings the ring forward on a slab of stone--I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on there, but it doesn&#39;t do any harm to the set. &nbsp;The tendency for Lego to include spares for the smaller parts also comes in extremely handy for this set--you get plenty of extra bones to decorate Gollum&#39;s boat, and a spare Sting. &nbsp;You also get a spare Ring, leading to the rather awkward situation of having&nbsp;<em>two</em> One Rings to Rule Them All...</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An excellent way to grab some main characters and a Ring</li>
	<li>Duplicate parts work to advantage</li>
	<li>The One Ring is done in proper chrome gold and looks very nice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Frodo is not going to be happy about that second Ring...</li>
</ul>

<p>Price-per-part is not bad, especially considering this is a licensed theme. &nbsp;As with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9469-1/Gandalf-Arrives"">#9469</a>, I&#39;m pleased that, as a casual fan, there was an easy way to grab some main characters without having to spend a lot for a more expensive set. &nbsp;That said, if you&#39;re more serious about LotR/Hobbit, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79003-1/An-Unexpected-Gathering"">#79003</a>&nbsp;(Bag End) is supposed to be a fantastic set.</p>

"Telcontar","2013-01-16T15:30:11.37Z","""'What have I got in my pocket?'""","<p>Even though this is the smallest Hobbit set it still is one of the best with great parts ans tons of playability...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is made up of the more flimsy types of cardboard and, like other small sets, requires your thumb to break it open.&nbsp; This may be a problem to people who like the keep the boxes neat but doesn't really affect most people.&nbsp; On the front of the box in small letters are written the words&nbsp;""Boat does not float"".&nbsp; So&nbsp;don't try to sail Gollum's boat in the sink or bathtub. ;-)&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts in this set are dark grey slopes which are very nice to have more of.&nbsp; Gollum's boat includes some bone pieces too.&nbsp; Also in the cave are some hinge plates which are very useful but rare.&nbsp; There's also a fish piece as well a&nbsp;<em>two</em> One Rings.&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>In this set you get two minifigs, Bilbo and Gollum.&nbsp; I typically start with the good guys so here we go...</p><p><strong>Bilbo Baggins: </strong>Bilbo is dressed in his red jacket with his green vest and yellow scarf.&nbsp; There's a little back printing but like other hobbits it's nothing too exciting.&nbsp; His short legs are dark tan.&nbsp; His hair is the exact same piece used for Sam in the LotR sets.&nbsp; He also comes with Sting.&nbsp; His head is double sided.&nbsp; One side is ""neutral/tired"" while the other is ""terrified"".&nbsp; Bilbo was both at this point in the story.&nbsp; How would you feel is you were&nbsp;lost in a&nbsp;cave a long way from home with a creature you can barely see&nbsp;threatening to&nbsp;eat you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gollum: </strong>Gollum (if you can call him a minifigure!) is exactly like the one in Shelob Attacks except for his eyes.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the Shelob set Gollum's eyes and mouth are more open while in this set there a little more closed.&nbsp; In both instances&nbsp;you can definately see the Gollum side coming out more than Smeagol.&nbsp; (I'm still hoping for a Smeagol faced Gollum.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty fun but it confused me for a moment about which way the slopes went. ;-)&nbsp; (May be I was just too tired, I don't know)&nbsp; Gollum's boat is even more simple which mainly consists of two brown ""cockpit"" pieces.&nbsp; Putting the bones on adds a lot more detail and gives it much more of an evil look.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished you have a small sturdy piece of rock that looks fantastic.&nbsp; When the axle on the side is turned the rock holding The Ring turns out, opening two sides of the rock.&nbsp; Like I mentioned before, the bones on Gollum's boat makes it look more menacing and adds to the tension in the scene.&nbsp; It works well as a display plus it has great playability (especially to those who know the story).&nbsp; The only problem is that Bilbo doesn't have a pocket! :-)</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all this is a great little set.&nbsp; It seems like LEGO has been sneaking the prices up on these types of set but not on this one.&nbsp; We get great pieces and lots of playability for a good price.&nbsp; I would really recommend getting (or giving) this set.</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-05-31T04:36:32.047Z","Not your typical 100 piece set!","<p>After being given a handful of Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit minifigures, I decided that maybe I should get a few sets. Unfortunately LOTR sets cost a pretty high premium these days so I decided to focus on some of the smaller, more affordable sets. This set is perhaps the cheapest and of course depicts perhaps the most important moment in the entire story, and the only scene to appear in both trilogies. I didn&rsquo;t expect too much, after all it is only a 100 brick set, but wow, this set is not just like a police car that you can build from the picture on the box, it is highly detailed and intricate set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s just say that the minifigures&nbsp;(Bilbo and Gollum) are excellent. I&rsquo;ve found that the LOTR minifigures&nbsp;are much more detailed than other minifigures&nbsp;from this time period. Much more detailed than their contemporary Star Wars minifigures, even today it is difficult to find minifigures that look this good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you start the build with the overly simple boat. Yes, a 4 year old could build this in 10 seconds, but don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s gonna get better. And actually, despite its simplicity, the boat does exactly what it needs to do. It is quite believable that this would be Gollum&rsquo;s boat, and the bones do add a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cave however where the ring is hidden is actually very elaborate. Yes, for the most part it is just simple brick stacking, but you have to play close attention. The details are excellent and intricate, while there is nothing symmetrical about the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has one play feature, by turning a technic axel you open the cave and reveal the ring. It doesn&rsquo;t work great, just barely opening the right side of the cave and not even touching the left side. While it could have been better designed with more frictionless bricks, it gives you the basic idea and the set is so small it takes minimal effort to operate the functions yourself. While this may upset me on a larger set, I can certainly forgive this set as it&rsquo;s rather impressive that they could squeeze a play feature into such a small space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with this set. You are certainly getting a lot for your money and while small, the set contains the detail and playability of a set two or three times it&rsquo;s size. I highly recommend getting this set, and it makes me very excited about what the larger sets have to offer.&nbsp;</p>
