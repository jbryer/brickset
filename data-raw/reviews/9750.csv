The set has 298 pieces including 4 minifigs for a retail price of $30 in the U.S. The set also has dark red leaves (which I think is the first time they have had that element in that color) and some other dark red plates and small slopes. I think this is a good value for the price.<div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/GLW6C.jpg?2[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span>The front of the box.

The set is divided into 2 numbered bags. In the first bag are the Legolas and Tauriel minifigures. They both look excellent. I got an extra one of her blades/swords as well (for 3 total). The blades are grey with yellow handles and yellow lines in the middle of the blades. I know some people have problems with LEGO having very few female characters (and the ones they have often needing to be saved) so it is great to see a really cool looking female character who appears to be doing the saving in this set.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/NFehy.jpg?2[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The other two minifigs in this set are Fili and Kili.

When I first saw the set I was a little&nbsp;ambivalent about the spiders but after putting them together I think they look kind of cute. They have 2 1x1 round plates for eyes, which are glow-in-the-dark. Their back part is attached by hinges and can move up and down. They are repetitive to build though. Both spiders are exactly the same and all the legs are made the same way, and they have 8 legs each!</div><div><br></div><div>The second bag has the trees in them.</div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/MaYLx.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span>The first tree is small but it does have an extra bow, a skull and a bone.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/frVKE.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></div><div>The second tree is much larger. This tree has a big spiderweb, 2 black spiders, a glow-in-the-dark spider, 2 bags or webs, 2 skulls, a bone, and mushrooms which have printed tops. My set was missing one of the cones for the mushroom top to sit on (but I got an extra mushroom top and reddish brown vine). I hope that is not a problem with other people's sets. This tree has a few play features. The white spider can hide in a little nook at the bottom under the mushrooms and there is a technic pin you can push to make it shoot out on unsuspecting minifigs.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/8CO50.jpg?2[/img]</span></span><br></div><div>There is also a technic pin that holds the top of the tree upright.

You get a lot of pieces for the price (particularly for a licensed set). I think the black, dark red and dark reddish brown pieces give the set a nice spooky feel. The minifigures are great and the set has a few play functions. There are also no stickers at all on the set, which is nice. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

<p>
 <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79001-1"" title=""View set details"">79001</a> Escape from Mirkwood Spiders is the second smallest set but it carries a hefty price tag in the UK (&pound;25) and a not-quite-so-hefty one in the USA ($30).</p>
<p>
 It features 4 minifigs, two giant spiders and two tree-like structures. As you can see from this picture, at last LEGO has started making autumn-colour foliage, but there are only two pieces in the set so to make a decent sized tree you&#39;ll need a lot of sets! Other interesting pieces include tan 2x2 dishes printed with a mushroom pattern. There are two in the set, and for some reason a third, spare one, was in mine, presumably it&#39;s in them all.</p>

<p>
 The eyes are&nbsp;glow-in-the-dark 1x1 round plates and I believe they are new in that colour.</p>

 The set also comes with three mini-spiders, two black and one glow-in-the-dark.</p>

The two elves are Legolas Greenleaf and Tauriel, a female elf who looks very cute :-)</p>
<p>
 Having just Googled her, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauriel"">Wikipedia </a>says &quot;The character does not appear in the original book, but was created by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh for the film series, the first part of which is planned for release in 2012. She is a Woodland Elf whose name means &quot;Daughter of Mirkwood&quot;, and is the head of the Mirkwood Elven guard. She is played by actress Evangeline Lilly.&quot;</p>
<p>
 So in that case she <em>will </em>be very cute, just as she was when she played Kate in <em>Lost :-) </em>Anyway, I digress...</p>

Besides chasing the dwarves round with the giant spiders they can be caught in these new fabric mesh spider&#39;s web pouches and hung from the branches.</p>
<p>
 The tree is hinged and can be dropped to the ground. I&#39;m not sure why.</p>
<p>
 This is another great set that is interesting to build and&nbsp;great to play with. I imagine that Mirkwood is a dark and evil place: &nbsp;the use of dark colours&nbsp;and the design of the&nbsp;creepy-looking trees&nbsp;set certainly conveys that well.</p>

 So, that&#39;ll be another one to add to your Christmas list, then...</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-10-28T19:37:30.767Z","Spiders, Gandalf.","<p><strong>Set #79001 Escape from Mirkwood Spiders: </strong>This is another set I've managed to pick up during the month of Bricktober, paid full price at first than got to price adjust it during a sale, so it was a decent savings.&nbsp;Let's get on with discussing the elements of the set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>A lot of LEGO's box designs are always sure to grab your attention on the shelf, and here with The Hobbit Theme there is no exception. Much like with other licensed themes of recent years there is a small box in the corner with the names of all the Mini-Figures included in the set.</p>
<p>The action shot on the front of the box looks great, and I can't wait to see this scene in the finished film in the next few months. The only off-putting aspect of the front of the box is the quickly included Special The Hobbit Trilogy Preview Set announcement. Due to the sudden change in the release of the films LEGO had to quickly modify this and the Barrel Escape sets, the red announcement is slightly too large for the box and covers up part of the image on the front.</p>
<p>The back shows off all the features of the set. As well as the weapons included.</p>
<p>The instructions are not protected by any cardboard, a lot of the 25-35$ range sets seem to have this issue as I've picked up a fair number of them in the past few weeks and have run the gamut from curled to squashed and looking very mangled. It would be nice if LEGO adopted a new policy in regards to the instructions. This is a numbered bag set so the instructions are broken up into two sections for each bag.</p>
<p>They are straightforward to follow and work well, provided you get a copy that hasn't been too rolled up making it hard to keep the book open on the pages you need.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this set are all very solid looking, honestly there are a lot of black and rich reddish maroon colored pieces, the build includes some nice red leaf pieces for the tree. You also get some glow in the dark items, a few printed pieces to make mushrooms, and some great looking cloth net/web bags to stick your dwarves in.</p>
<p>You also get a lot of nice weapons and some interesting looking large sloped pieces, not sure on the formal name for them just yet.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set includes four great looking Mini-Figures, all of which are must own characters from The Hobbit film series. You recieve two members of the Dwarf Company, the young Dwarves Kili and Fili.</p>
<p>Kili has a nice dark brown torso with double-sided printing showing off the costume worn by the character in the film, you can see a nice belt/strap over one shoulder and the barest hint of some kind of special looking undershirt.</p>
<p>He has a bow and quiver and a double-sided head showing a neutral expression and a open mouthed determined warrior look as he prepares to defend himself from the spiders. He and Fili have similar, though not identical hair pieces, long highly detailed sculpted parts that capture the look of the characters from the film. The best part is they are sculpted in such a way that they allow for the quiver to fit in a noticeable groove, a nice touch from LEGO. Kili's is black.</p>
<p>Fili shares the same colouring for the torso, while his short legs are a matching dark brown instead of the black Kili uses. The print is again double-sided with belts and a strap over a well worn fur lined vest or more likely jacket.</p>
<p>His weapons include another quiver and two short swords to fight the spiders and he also has a double-sided head with determined and&nbsp;smiling expressions. Fili has a nice mustache and beard print on his face that is different from the more stubbly look of his brother. He has a nice matching light brown hair piece.</p>
<p>The differences between the two dwarves hairpieces are actually in the coloring and that's pretty much it, on closer examination I've discovered they are pretty much the same exact piece, just using different plastics.</p>
<p>This set also includes two elves, Legolas Greenleaf, a very familiar character for LotR fans. And officially the first LEGO Female elf as this set was released prior to Council of Elrond and Arwen. Tauriel is her name.</p>
<p>Tauriel features a very nice dark brown and green colored body with a double-sided torso print showing off her armor, this printing carries down to the top of her legs. She also has a double-sided head, actually I'll just say it now, every single Mini-Figure in this set has a double-sided head and torso print.</p>
<p>She has a neutral expression and an angry warrior-in-battle expression, she features some cute freckles on her face also. Like with all elves she uses the same hairpiece first introduced with her companion back during the LotR initial wave. This time it's colored red. She is wielding twin Daggers of Time, at least that's what it was called when introduced in the Prince of Persia Theme of LEGO. (The set includes three, two for Tauriel and an extra in case lost or misplaced.)</p>
<p>Legolas just looks superb, he's dressed in the Mirkwood Elf outfit he'll be wearing in the next Hobbit film and has a nice dark brown torso with pearl gold arm combination. His hair prevents him from wearing a quiver unfortuantely, however the print design looks great. With armor running down from the torso onto the upper legs and visible clasps on the back showing how he wears this armor.</p>
<p>I believe his hair and head are the same as his LotR counterpart, though not owning one yet I can't be 100% sure on that. He has a bow for his weapon and that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>Overall these Mini-Figures are impressively detailed, have a rich earthy tone all around and work well with the set.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There are two bags, the first is for building two identical giant spiders. Not as large as Shelob, these are more than likely some of her children, a much smaller breed.</p>
<p>The second bag builds up a small forest set piece with dark foreboding looking trees, the spider's lair. The spiders are kind of repetitive in the build while the trees are a bit more unique, however still a bit lacking. While they do include a lot of wonderfully dark colored pieces I think the design could have been slightly improved upon.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The spiders have a few glow-in-the-dark studs for eyes and balance nicely on the eight legs used in their build. Scalewise they look nice next to the Mini-Figures. The fact that they are both identical does take away slightly from their design, though not by much.</p>
<p>The tips of their legs are a bit sharp even though they are made useing a slightly softer plastic, I'd caution how you handle the builds.</p>
<p>The smaller of the two tree models is pretty uneventful, you have a nice brown vine piece and a place to clip the spare bow included in the set. It's got some remains of previous spider victims as well.</p>
<p>The larger of the two tree models is taller, and includes a few play features. When you pull a technic pin out you can topple the tree to release the dwarves from the two web/net bags that store them when captured by the spiders. Another feature is a small technic pin/1x2 brick combination that when pushed forward sends a glow-in-the-dark spider out from a hidden alcove.</p>
<p>There are two regular black spiders with the set also, one of which sits on a glow-in-the-dark web.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a pretty impressive set with a few minor issues. The main model could use a bit of improvement, perhaps if the tree had featured a few more layers to it so that it came off as a bit larger and imposing, perhaps allowing for one of the larger spider models to sit on it less awkwardly.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are all very good and you'll need two of them to complete your Dwarf company, while the others are great for expanding your elven army.</p>
<p>I'm especially impressed by the web/net bags they can hold short legged Mini-Figures pretty snuggly, but long-legged Mini-Figures might sit in there a bit oddly. All the colors chosen for this set are very impressive and highly useful for MOCers. I could care less about the play features though, not every set really needs them and in this case I think it's a bit unfortunate that they feel the need to include them in a set aimed more at older kids/collectors.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"lkb57","2014-03-17T20:31:24.41Z","No Flies, but a lot of Spiders!","<p>I was anxious to get my hands on this set for a number of reasons: first, it comes with a ton of parts that are incredibly useful for building forest (specifically autumn) scenes; and second, three of the minifigures&nbsp;(Tauriel, Fili and Kili) are exclusive to this set, and all four of them are fantastic. Despite these great pieces and minifigs, my overall opinion of the set was decidedly neutral: the set doesn&#39;t provide a great deal of playability, mainly because while the spiders are fun to build, there isn&#39;t much for them or the minifigs to play on . . . just too little trees that aren&#39;t large enough to stand on.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, the set is littered with great parts. For this reason a lone, you should snap this set up if you see it. The dark red leaves and pale mushrooms were definitely my favorite pieces, but you also get a host of arches and slopes that come in handy for either forest or architecture MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All of them were awesome. Front and back printing, of course, dual expressions for each of them, and printing on the legs for Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel&#39;s&nbsp;daggers are a great addition. In short, both the LOTR collectors and people on the hunt for great caste/Historica related accessories will want all four of these figs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick and simple. The spiders were fun to construct (and they look good alongside <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9470-1/Shelob-Attacks"">Shelob</a>), but other than that this set didn&#39;t throw out any surprises.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As stated above, despite it&#39;s great selection of parts, the set kind of failed to come together in any sort of &quot;awesome-ness&quot;. Not that it&#39;s a bad set, it just isn&#39;t anything special, especially when compared to some of the LOTR sets like Gandalf&#39;s Arrival, which somehow manage to come together as a great piece with fun features, despite the small size.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you&#39;re an LOTR/Hobbit completionist, or on the hunt for pieces/minifig accessories to flesh out a castle MOC, this set is a must-buy.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows a picture of this set with the characters in action.&nbsp; In the corner is a red box which reads ""Special The Hobbit trilogy preview set!"".&nbsp; This is because of what happened last summer.&nbsp; At first when LEGO got licenses to make Hobbit (and LotR) sets there were going to be only two films.&nbsp; In the summer that was changed to three.&nbsp; Consequently the ending of film one got pushed earlier in the story.&nbsp;That is why we don't see this (or Barrel Escape) in the first film (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey). LEGO was already too far along in the production process to change drastically so they added these red boxes on fronts of the sets and made them special ""preview"" sets.&nbsp; Anyhow, I'm glad because that means more elves!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In this set we get part of Mirkwood.&nbsp; At the time of the Hobbit mirkwood was a very twisted and dangerous place, especially the southern part.&nbsp; Because of that we get lots of dark pieces to convey this feeling in the LEGO set.&nbsp; We do get two new, red foliage pieces which are fantastic.&nbsp; The only disappointment is that there are only two of them.&nbsp; There are also some&nbsp;glow in the dark pieces.&nbsp; The only time&nbsp;you can see those is in the dark, but when you're in the dark you can't see the rest of the set.&nbsp; There's also some new&nbsp;mushroom caps which are fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p><strong>Fili: </strong>Fili and his brother Kili are the two youngest members of Thorin Oakenshield's company.&nbsp; Fili's torso&nbsp;is nicely done&nbsp;and is very accurate to the new film.&nbsp;&nbsp;His head is also very accurate with&nbsp;his facial hair.&nbsp; Like most LotR/Hobbit sets his head is double&nbsp;sided.&nbsp; One face is ""neutral/happy"" while the other is ""angry/fighting"".&nbsp; His hair, which is a new mold, allows for his quiver to fit on his back.</p><p><strong>Kili: </strong>Kili is Fili's brother and the two are also Thorin's nephews.&nbsp; Kili's printing is also very accurate to the movie.&nbsp; Like Fili&nbsp;his face is double sided, one with ""neutral"" the other with an ""angry/fighting"" expression.&nbsp; Just to keep them straight, Fili is the blond one while Kili&nbsp;has the dark hair.</p><p><strong>Tauriel: </strong>Tauriel is&nbsp;an original character&nbsp;in the films.&nbsp; She&nbsp;was never invented by Tolkien.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we really don't know too much about her.&nbsp; However, this is what the LEGO Hobbit micro-site says: <em>Tauriel</em> is the head of the <i>Elven Guard of Mirkwood</i>. Her name means ""Daughter of Mirkwood"" and she is exactly that. While beautiful and graceful, she is strong and fiercely dangerous with her daggers, bow and arrow if anyone threatens her realm. As most Elves, she distrusts Dwarves but respects and honors the alliance that has long existed between her people and men. Always guided by her strong sense of justice, she is a beloved leader and a powerful ally to her friends.&nbsp; (<a href=""http://thehobbit.lego.com/en-us/characters/gollum/#/en-us/characters/tauriel"">http://thehobbit.lego.com/en-us/characters/gollum/#/en-us/characters/tauriel</a>).&nbsp; Whoever she is her printing is very well done.&nbsp; Her leg and torso printing lines up seamlessly.&nbsp; Her hair mold is like other&nbsp;LEGO elves but this time in a new color.&nbsp; She comes with two daggers too.&nbsp; I believe they're from Prince of Persia sets but I'm not sure.&nbsp; I suppose they work&nbsp;for elvish knives except for a small dent a little above the hilt.</p><p><strong>Legolas: </strong>Yes, Legolas.&nbsp; He wasn't in the Hobbit <em>per se,&nbsp;</em>but his father was Thranduil, king of the Mirkwood&nbsp;Elves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Legolas was around a thousand years old at the time of the Lord of the Rings so it is entirely possible that he could've been&nbsp;there during the events of The Hobbit.&nbsp; He's in an entirely different costume than&nbsp;in his LotR copy.&nbsp; It looks a lot more like Tauriel's as far as design goes.&nbsp; His head, hair, and bow are the same though.<br>&nbsp;…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build, like most Hobbit sets, was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; But building the spiders got a little repetitive.&nbsp; Plus it got a little tiring looking at black and brown pieces for a while.&nbsp; But even with all this it was still great.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished it looks suitibly menacing and spooky, very fitting for Mirkwood.&nbsp; The largest tree has a couple ""play funtions"" too.&nbsp; The main one is in the tree itself.&nbsp; When you pull out a technic axle the tree comes down so the elves can rescue (capture rather) the dwarves from the spiders.&nbsp; You can also fire a glow in the dark spider which also uses an axle piece.&nbsp; I haven't mentioned it yet but the sacks that the dwarves are in are very nice.&nbsp; I've been careful with them this far but I'd imagine that they would be easy to tear.&nbsp; Until then they look very nice.&nbsp; The spiders look like miniature versions of Shelob (they were, of course, her descendants).&nbsp; But because they are smaller they are less pose-able.&nbsp; This set looks great as a display and has fantastic playability.&nbsp; This would be great for pretty much anyone who's not arachnophobic.&nbsp;:-)&nbsp; The price is good too (at least in the US), especially since it's a licensed set.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set.&nbsp; It captures all the danger and spookiness of Mirkwood and packs in hours of future play.&nbsp; I'm just curious to see how this sequence works out in the movie.&nbsp; In the book it's Bilbo who rescues the dwarves from the spiders not Legolas.&nbsp; Hmm...</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-06-01T05:49:54.18Z","A great small set ","<p>It may seem odd I would call a set with nearly 300 bricks small, but due to the fact that it contains 4 separate builds, it comes off feeling like a small set. But that isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, this set has a lot to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Like all other LOTR minifigures, the ones in this set are great and highly detailed. Kili and Fili&nbsp;are near identical, in fact their hair is the same mold just different colors, yet they are so nicely detailed that it&rsquo;s diffi to notice their hair is the same mold. The same is true of Legolas and Tauriel, hair is the same mold but different colors, plus their legs contain identical prints. But fear not, the torso prints are unique and both align perfectly with the legs, resulting in another 2 great minifigures. Getting 4 highly detailed minifigures is great for a set of this size, especially considering that Legolas is one of the few characters to appear in both stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>So you start with the spiders, which are two identical builds. While it may not appear obvious how they get built when looking at the picture of them, as you complete each step of the build, you will feel like you can predict the next stop. The spiders are well designed but very logical, so don&rsquo;t expect any surprises here. The end result is fantastic, they are very believable spiders, however it would have been nice if they had slightly different color palettes. Just one or two different colored bricks would probably have been enough to make each spider unique.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you have the two trees. I&rsquo;m not quite sure why they needed to be separate, I think they look nice side by side, but I suppose separating them allows for more room to play. The larger tree is certainly the most interesting of the two. It includes 2 play features. First, and most important, by pulling out a technic axel&nbsp;it allows for the tree to fall down. Of course it works well, but it would have been nice if pushing something on the ground or side of the tree would trigger the action, it would have made it a more realistic play feature. I suppose I could always make a modification to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second play feature is quite silly, you can put a small spider under a rock and push it out. Yes it works well, but it&rsquo;s the same technique used in Lego Juniors sets. So sadly the two play features are a little disappointing, they work well but could have used more engineering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The smaller tree is simply just a smaller tree, no play features. Both trees are nice and have great details (skulls and bones) and use very unique Halloween like colors, but neither tree is a complete tree, at best they are only a quarter of a real tree. I would have much preferred one larger much more complete tree, but I suppose this way gives you the ability to set the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Despite my complaints I do like this set. Sure it could be improved, but at the same time this set up is well done. I highly recommend picking up this set should you get the chance.&nbsp;</p>
