 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228872407/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""159"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8228872407_189ae29b8c_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79003-1"" title=""View set details"">79003</a> A Unexpected Gathering is, without doubt, the best Hobbit set. It&#39;s also the best set of 2012. In fact, I think I agree with Andrew over at Brothers-Brick who said <a href=""http://www.brothers-brick.com/2012/11/13/lego-hobbit-79003-an-unexpected-gathering-best-set-of-all-time-review"">in his review </a>that it could just be the best set of all time.</p>
<p>
 That is a very bold statement to make but it really does tick all the boxes.</p>
<p>
 Read on to find out why you <em>have </em>to buy this set...</p>

 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8229938146/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""159"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8347/8229938146_b22e77d125_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>So, what&#39;s so special about it? First,&nbsp;the <strong>design</strong>. For a start it&#39;s built onto a sturdy base.</p>
<p>
 So often these days sets are&nbsp;just a collection of sub-assemblies that don&#39;t join together (like, in fact, most of the other Hobbit sets), but that&#39;s not the case here. Everything is fixed to the large plate-built base and the result is very sturdy.</p>
<hr />
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228871823/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""159"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8228871823_75bb7c7885_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>Next, the<strong> build-process </strong>is very satisfying. It&#39;s generally easy and straightforward but there are some touches of genius, particularly the way the large round window is made.</p>
<p>
 Often you build a set only to have a feeling that the designer has scrimped on bricks to keep the cost down, but not so here, it&#39;s solid,&nbsp;sturdy and&nbsp;there&#39;s not a&nbsp;big ugly single use piece in sight.</p>
<hr />
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228871961/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""159"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8228871961_33529606e1_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>Thirdly, the <strong>parts selection </strong>is excellent. Lots of greens, browns, tans and &#39;earthy&#39; colours. There are some new pieces, and old pieces in new colours. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228871567/in/photostream/"">This picture </a>shows some of them. The best can barely be seen in the photo: a transparent 4x4 ring plate like the dark orange ones in the picture.</p>
<p>
 There are no &#39;filler&#39; pieces in odd colours, everything is useful.</p>

I think the pretzel-shaped loaf (or whatever it is) on the table is new, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>
 There&#39;s four reasons why it qualifies as the best set ever, and I haven&#39;t even mentioned the minifigs yet...</p>
<hr />
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228872557/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""240"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8228872557_f90a2757b5_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>The set comes with 6 minifigs. Here&#39;s Gandalf the Grey, who&#39;s the same as in other sets, and Bilbo Baggins, who is sporting a torso unique to this set.</p>

<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228872687/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""135"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8228872687_31649c90da_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>It also contains four dwarves, from left to right: Bofur, Bombur, Balin and Dwalin. All are&nbsp;excellent and feature unique hair, beards, or both. You can&#39;t quite see it in this picture but Bombur has, how can I say it politely, a &#39;stomach extension&#39; under his beard.</p>
<p>
 One thing I haven&#39;t mentioned in the Hobbit reviews, but I&#39;ve been asked about, is the origin of the new minifig parts. The vast majority are of European or Mexican origin. The only ones that aren&#39;t are those that are complex and painted, such as Bofur&#39;s hat in this set. Having said that there is nothing at all wrong with them and nothing to worry about.</p>
<hr />
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8228872799/"" title=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""79003 An Unexpected Gathering"" height=""100"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8228872799_90b5ef1582_m.jpg"" style=""margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>All have printed back and three have double-sided heads. Dwalin has a tattooed back-of-head which looks excellent.</p>
<p>
 So, there&#39;s the fifth and reason: the <strong>minifigs </strong>are all superb and, being dwarves, cute and cuddly :-)</p>
<hr />
<p>
 So what&#39;s not to like? Excellent sturdy design, satisfying build, great parts selection, highly playable and superb minifigs. The finished model looks idyllic, just as you imagine life in The Shire to be.&nbsp;Even the price (&pound;60, US$70) is pretty good.</p>
<p>
 Is there anything negative I can say about it? I&#39;m hard pushed to&nbsp;anything I don&#39;t like, to be honest. I guess it would have been nice to get a&nbsp;different Gandalf, and stickers are always annoying (although to be fair there are not many, they mostly go onto tiles and they are printed on clear film so won&#39;t peel).</p>
<p>
 I suppose the worse thing is that stubby-legged dwarves and Hobbits&nbsp;can&#39;t sit on the stools provided for them round the table, but there&#39;s not much the set designer could have done about that, I guess.</p>
<p>
 Best set of the year? Definitely! Best set of all time? I reckon it comes close! What do you think?</p>

"CapnRex101","2012-12-02T11:26:54.077Z","79003 - An Unexpected Gathering","<p>The Hobbit sets have been highly anticipated in the months since images were first revealed, and this set was probably the most exciting of all of those. I must say, this has instantly become a favourite of mine, quite possibly this is the best set in my collection in fact, as other reviewers have suggested. From every aspect, this is just about unbeatable it seems to me, brilliant Minifigures, wonderful parts, and a fantastic final model. Anyway, on with the main review... &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packaging for this model is also very nice indeed with some excellent artwork and a rather nice design all in all. The box is quite large, with a beautiful image of the village of&nbsp;Hobbiton&nbsp;in the Shire centred upon the ever popular Bag End, home of Bilbo Baggins. In the background are some other homes and the rolling hills we see in the films, as well as a wooded area. The sun appears to be setting which creates a nice atmosphere for the picture as the six Minifigures included stand outside Bag End eating and drinking. The door to the house is open and inside looks very inviting with a warm orange glow and smoke rising from the chimney. There is a nice border along the top with the Lego and The Hobbit logos side by side with the misty mountains forming the background to this. In the bottom left hand corner is a gallery shot of all six Minifigures as well.</p><p>The back of the box also has some attractive artwork, this time showing the inside of Bag End as well as some of the play scenarios which could be acted out if you so wished in smaller images around the larger central shot. There are not all that many features in this set but the roof is shown lifting off and the incredible accessories included are displayed as well. This is certainly not a negative though as there is still a great deal of playability to be had whether or not there are many play features.</p><p>The two instruction manuals share the same artwork as the box cover and each one was perfect with no mistakes. At the back of the second booklet are some advertisements for other sets in the theme and a very welcome image of all the Hobbit Minifigures released in this Winter wave.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As I already mentioned, from a parts point of view, this is an absolutely excellent set with a huge number of pieces in rare colours and even a few brand new moulds! These new pieces include Bombur's beard and hair piece, Dwalin's beard, Balin's hair and beard component and Bofur's huge hood, all of which look simply fantastic. We also get five four by four ring plates which are wonderful, four of them are in dark tan, and the other is uncoloured translucent. They are superb pieces and I look forward to seeing them incorporated into MOCs in the future. We also get a huge number of food items such as carrots, apples, a baguette, a sausage, some bottles and goblets, several bunches of cherries, a couple of pieces of chicken, and even a pretzel! This is an incredible selection and one which is very useful for recreating the banquet which the dwarves have at Bag End in the book and film.</p><p>There are ten masonry pieces cast in nougat, along with two yellow dishes and a vast helping of green slopes of various sizes, shapes, and shades. There are a huge number of useful accessories as well such as swords, a broom, a shovel and a pick-axe, as well as a book on which two stickers can be applied to turn it into the famous 'There and Back Again, a Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.' The list of useful and interesting pieces could go on and on, but sufficed to say that this is by far the best selection of parts I have ever found in a single set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures are a real&nbsp;highlight&nbsp;of this set, but it is difficult to pick them out as the biggest draw because every element of the model is so good, however they are certainly must have Minifigures for your collection. I will begin with The Hobbit himself, <b>Bilbo Baggins</b>, this is a fantastic Minifigure and an exclusive one but for the Bilbo Baggins promotional item which was given away at the San Diego Comic Con in 2012, but I do not personally count that as a set so to me this figure is exclusive. He&nbsp;features&nbsp;the same hair mould as other Hobbits in the same colour as that of Samwise Gamgee, dark tan. There is plenty of moulded detail and it very closely resembles Bilbo's hair in the film. His face is double sided, with brown eyebrows and a few wrinkles on both sides, but two different expressions, one of happiness and one of sadness.&nbsp;</p><p>His torso is printed with a tan striped shirt with an open collar and a pair of braces like most Hobbits wear. On the back this design is continued with crossed braces, his arms are tan while his hands are flesh in colour. This torso and his plain dark brown short legs are what distinguish him from the more common Bilbo in his travelling garb appearing in other sets from this wave. Overall, a very nice Minifigure indeed and it is even better for being exclusive.</p><p>Next up is the legendary wizard <b>Gandalf the Grey</b>, this Minifigure is the only one which is not exclusive to this set, also appearing in set 9469, Gandalf Arrives and the polybag set 30213, Gandalf at Dol Guldur. Nevertheless, he is very welcome and a lovely Minifigure. He comes with his dark grey hat which is a nice mould (albeit very old), and a great head piece which is only printed on one side with bushy grey eyebrows, wrinkles, and a kind expression which is obscured by his light bluish grey beard. This is another marvellous piece, with plenty of texture and an accurate interpretation of his facial hair in the films.&nbsp;</p><p>He wears a plain dark grey cape which folds around his neck and his torso too is dark grey with some folds in the fabric of his shirt and a brown buckled belt. On the back of the torso piece the creases and belt are continued, but this is totally obscured by the cape included. His arms are plain dark bluish grey and his hands are flesh in colour like Bilbo's. Last of all are his plain dark grey legs which are the standard length and can be posed unlike all of the other Minifigures in this set. He carries his staff which is represented here by a simple reddish brown pole, which is perfectly satisfactory as well.</p><p>Now we come on to my favourite Minifigures in the set, the four dwarves,&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;with <b>Dwalin</b>. This is perhaps the most violent of the thirteen dwarves and one who is particularly loyal to their leader Thorin Oakenshield, with a&nbsp;personal&nbsp;interest in the mission meeting with success. His head piece is printed on both sides, on the front with a serious expression and several wrinkles and scars, as well as two dark blue tattoos. On the back these detailed tattoos are continued along with a few spots on his skin which is very nice indeed. His heard piece is brand new and very detailed with some texture and an accurate appearance in relation to The Hobbit films.&nbsp;</p><p>Dwalin wears a short olive green cape with only a single hole so that it is does not interfere with the beard piece&nbsp;fitting&nbsp;on properly. His torso is highly detailed and features some green padding, several brown straps and a huge silver buckle on the front, as well as some fur and the rest of his belt on the back which is hidden by the cape. His arms are flesh in colour and his gloved hands are dark bluish grey. The legs included with this Minifigure are plain dark brown, and being a dwarf, they are short and not poseable. He carries two weapons, a huge brick built war hammer which is suitably brutal for this character, and a small dagger for closer combat.</p><p>The next dwarf is <b>Balin</b>, one of the oldest and wisest of the thirteen. He is referred to in the Lord of the Rings trilogy as the deceased and entombed former leader of an expedition to Moria, where the Fellowship of the Ring find him, much to the dismay of Gimli in particular, his cousin. This figure too has a new hair piece just for him which is cast in white with plenty of texture. It is accurate in appearance to the films and is an especially well designed piece for a fairly difficult hairstyle to render in Lego. His head is printed on both sides with two different expressions, one smiling, and one frowning. Both sides are printed with lots of wrinkles and some white eyebrows.</p><p>He wears a short dark red cape which is delightful and&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;to this figure. It also matches his torso nicely which is decorated with some rather regal patterning and another belt with an enormous buckle like that of Dwalin. On the back of his torso this belt is also printed despite being obscured by the cape. His arms are dark red like his torso and his hands are black as he is wearing gloves. His legs are short and plain black, and he carries a short sword with which to defend himself.</p><p>Yet another dwarf included is the miner <b>Bofur</b>. He wears a fur edged hood which is a particularly interesting piece and one which is made of a slightly flexible plastic and printed in two colours, brown for the fabric of the hood, and dark grey for the furry lining. The component fits nicely over his head and cape and looks excellent once it is on, as well as being very accurate indeed. The head piece is highly detailed as well, with two faces, one on either side of the head. On both faces some brown facial hair is printed as well as a few wrinkles and a pair of eyebrows, however the expressions vary. One is a smile, the other an angry grimace for when he goes charging into battle.</p><p>Bofur wears a short brown cape around his neck and his torso is printed with a brown shirt beneath a nougat coloured jacket with some creases in it and a belt with several pockets and buckles on it. The reverse of the torso is printed with yet more folds in the fabric and the rest of his belt. His arms are nougat in colour, and his hands are flesh. The short legs piece is reddish brown and he holds a single accessory, a pick-axe which suits him as a miner more than a soldier.</p><p>Last of all is my favourite of all the thirteen dwarves, <b>Bombur</b>. He is a rowdy dwarf who enjoys his food and is the brother of Bofur. His combined hair and beard piece is absolutely brilliant with braided ginger hair and a bald patch on the top of his head. Also part of this component is a section which rests next to his torso to exaggerate his stomach and achieve the appearance of a fat character. I am absolutely delighted with how this looks and it really adds character to the Minifigure as does the green shirt poking out through his beard on this piece. His head piece is printed on both sides with ginger eyebrows and a smiling expression on each. The only difference that I can find with each face is that on one his expression is of surprise, whereas on the other, it is a more neutral and satisfied grin.</p><p>His torso is printed with an olive green shirt underneath a brown jacket and a rather large belly, all of this however is covered up by the combined beard, hair and torso piece. On the back of this part is some more of his creased brown jacket, his arms are olive green and his hands are simply flesh in colour. The legs are dark grey and short like the rest of the dwarves in this set and the others. He carries two items with him, a black cooking pot and a sausage, both of which are very suited to his rather corpulent character!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build process for this set is very enjoyable with an ingenious technique used for making the large round window towards the left side of Bag End. The fence which runs along the front is also made quite cleverly and looks very nice indeed, as do the round front door and windows which make use of those new four by four ring pieces. The entire structure is very solid and is, simply put, a nice and well built model with an incredibly fun construction phase. The only very minor gripe I have are the few stickers included which are a little bit annoying, but are not very difficult to apply so are no big problem, it is just a shame that the three maps included are not printed tiles but are in fact just stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As a whole, this is among the best models for display that I own. Not only does it look wonderful and incredibly accurate from the outside, but the inside too is highly detailed and there is plenty of play potential here as well. In the front garden are some nice features, including a rickety looking fence, a small opening gate, some bushes, a bench, lots of flowers, and a vegetable garden including a wonderful area of carrots growing! The stone garden path leads up to the round front door which is truly unique and looks amazing. It is a printed piece with some nice details and the mark which&nbsp;Gandalf&nbsp;makes on the door to point out that this is the house of the fourteenth member of the company to the dwarves. Some of the round windows have window boxes containing more flowers and there is a lamp suspended above the front door. On the top of the model is a stout tree and the chimney stack, also, the look of this Hobbit Hole being built into a hill has been effectively recreated and I think it looks excellent.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside we find just as much detail as we did outside, including lots of shelving with such items as a bottle, several jars, an envelope (perhaps the one which holds the One Ring at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring). We also&nbsp;receive&nbsp;the sword Sting, which was not in fact in Bilbo's possession at this time, but is still a nice inclusion if you were to use the same model to recreate the scenes at the start of the Fellowship of the Ring which one might. There is a broom clipped by the door on the wall and next to that is the fireplace and chimney, which lines up nicely with the chimney on top of the Bag End and can have a saucepan and knife suspended above it using two clips. The desk on which Bilbo's 'There and Back Again' book is resting is also included along with a quill in a pot of ink. The round front door opens to let in any guests (whether they are wanted or not) and there are some nougat tiles on the floor by the entrance. A large table around which six Minifigures can sit is laden with lots of the food included and we also get a barrel, a chest with a shovel in it, and three maps of the Shire, Mirkwood and the Lonely Mountain itself.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you are buying only one set this year, make it this one! It truly is a must have which should appeal to everyone, whether it be as a parts pack, or simply a marvellous set which has plenty of play value as well as looking great on display. The Minifigures and their accessories are sublime and the price for all of this is very reasonable in my opinion. As far as I can see there is not a single real downside to this set, and I recommend it very highly to anybody, young or old. For all Lord of the Rings or Hobbit fans this is something which you simply must have in your collection.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - <b>10/10</b></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Firox_5000","2012-12-12T12:39:54.603Z","Best Hobbit set by far","This was the second Hobbit set I built after a shopping trip at Legoland Windsor. The set features 652 pieces and six figures and costs £59.99.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>The build&nbsp;</b></div><div>The set took me 75-90 minutes to complete within 4 numbered bags and offered a very exciting and amusing building process.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The figures</b></div><div>the set includes 6 mini figures [5 of whom are new and exclusive to this set]. The first figure is Bilbo Baggins who is wearing a buttoned shirt on the front with the top and with some printing on the back of his torso too where the top of the trousers go over. He has two facial expressions, one which he seems quite cheerful while the other shows a look of worry. He also has a detailed ginger hair piece.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second figure is Balin the dwarf who also has a doubled printed torso with a belt printing on both sides making the detail very high. He also has a hair and beard piece which are both connected which go over his head. Balin also has facial expressions too one showing a happy face and another one more sort of a cross face. The figure is also holding a sword as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The next figure is Dwalin the dwarf who also has doubled torso printing making a nice touch with printings of his belt and some armoury too by the looks. He also wears a short by clever beard piece which is a new piece. This figure unlike most does not have double sided head printing but instead has back head printing of what could be back hair or symbol printing. The figure also comes with a large hammer and also a small knife.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Bombur the dwarf is the next figure in the set who has double printing on his torso with a minimal but effective amount showing a plain shirt with different parts of lining on the back too. The figure has two facial expression like most of the others with a happy face and a excited face. Bombur also has a ginger headpiece which also doubled as not just a hair piece and a beard piece but also a tummy expansion giving the character a more rounded look. The figure also includes a cooking pot and a red sausage piece too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another figure in this set is Bofur the dwarf who also has double torso printing with a belt and other printing there which the back is mostly concealed by a red cape on the figure. Bofur also has two printed faces one with a happy face on one side and an angry face on the other. He also has a headpiece which is made of a rubbery material and look like it is some form of large hat/cape. Bofur also comes with a shovel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final figure in the set is Gandalf who despite being a great design of the figure is actually the least interesting because he appears in two other sets in his current form. That being said, he is a great designed figure with his wand, double printed torso and wizard hat too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The model&nbsp;</b></div><div>The main model of the set consists of the rather large hobbit house that is known as Bag End as is filled detail all over both inside and outside.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The outside features brown fence and a gate with some wood planks too [unfortunately their stickers] which give the house a fuller look. The rounded window pieces giving it the hobbit house look and the main window on the far left also really help deliver with the detail. There is also a bench, some vegetables, flowers and a growing patch on the front of the house too. There is also the round doorway too which opens allowing the figures to go in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The inside of the model is just as well decorated as the outside. The main object is a large table with six seats to fit minifigures and also food, drink including chicken,bread,berries and a pretzel. There is also a barrel with an apple on top and some maps or pictures on the floor too as well as a chest with a shovel inside as well. The house also includes a small but well decorated fire place/ cooker so the figures can cook food. There is also a shelf area with a book and quill plus some shelving areas around the interior too giving the set that much fuller detail.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even the roof is detailed in this set with the small chimney using the new brick printed pieces there and also the tree on the top of the house too. The light green tree pieces also help alot too. The sides of Bag end are also nicely detailed with the same technique of the round plates giving the windows that circular look.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Summary</b></div><div>The set is an outstanding lego model and features a lot of effort and detail input in to the model and contains many unique parts from the mini figures double printed torso and headpieces to the beautifully coloured parts the set is comprised of including the lightly golden coloured round pieces and the mixture of green pieces in the model comprising of dark and light green throughout.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set at £60 isn't too bad and I would describe it as being one of the more reasonable prices sets especially seeing how overpriced sets like the Wargs and Mirkwood are.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Whether you intend to buy all the Hobbit sets or not or even none at all, this is one Lego I recommend every Lego fan out there should buy and this is perhaps the best Lego set of 2012 [at least].&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"tkettle9719","2012-12-26T19:40:52.877Z","""I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure..."" -Gandalf the Grey","<p>I got this set as a Christmas present from my grandparents, who found this as a last-minute sort of gift. Bag End is one of my favorite scenes from the Middle-Earth franchise, so when I got this I was super happy.&nbsp; I built it yesterday, and was ecstatic.Based on other reviewers, many have deemed this an excellent set. But does it live up to my standards of Lego sets? Is this actually a worthy set to purchase full price? Is this really the best set of the year?<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The hobbit-hole of Mr. Bilbo Baggins is recognizable immediately, what with its green structure, the round door in the front, and the tree on top of the hill which the home is located in. <br></li><li>The accessories are plentiful and well-fitting; the flowers on the side and the front of the house work very well, all of the foodstuff pieces are very suitable, and the dinner table just looks very nice. <br></li><li>This is an awesome parts pack for anybody (although anyone buying only one of these would never in their right mind not build this), especially with all of the green parts and standard pieces here (many are common, everyday pieces, not exclusive to this set. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons (not really...)<br></h4>
<ul><li>Sure, I could go on about how there are stickers in this set, how the majority of the dwarfs aren't in here, or even how this is scaled for play and not an accurate size for Bag End, but I'm not going to. The stickers are excellently detailed, there are just enough dwarfs to fit into this version of Bag End, and this is not an MOC; it needs to be scaled down, and they do a perfect job here.

<p>This is definitely living up to all of the hype other reviewers have given to this set. It is very accurate and recognizable, and it is chock full of minifigures (just enough, too; any more would not work in a set of this size). The little details make this set just that much better, and every detail is accounted for here. I don't even care if this has an old Gandalf; it still looks fantastic with multiples. I've had this set for two days and it is now my set of the year. Get it anywhere; even Toys 'R' Us's inflationistic agenda can't topple this set; it is that awesome (okay, a bit of exaggeration, but you get the point). GET IT NOW!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"IanRohan","2012-12-27T17:05:22.54Z","""We don't want any adventures here, thank you!"" - Bilbo Baggins","<p>In his official review, Huw called this the &quot;best Lego set of all time&quot;, and while that is a very bold statement for an expensive, licensed set, I heartily agree with him. &nbsp;There is quite literally nothing I could or would change about this set to make it any better.</p>

<p>Box and Instructions -&nbsp;The set arrives (in my case under the Christmas tree) in a very nice box, whose back does a nice job of clearly displaying all the wonderful food and other accessories you get. &nbsp;The box is sealed with tape, so for fanatical Lego-box-collectors like me, the box is easily opened without damage.</p>

<p>The instructions come without the cardboard backing, and mine were pretty bent. But really this isn&#39;t a big deal, can be fixed by placing them under the dictionary overnight, and definitely shouldn&#39;t deter you from the set.</p>

<p>Parts -&nbsp;First of all - the food! &nbsp;You get just about every notable food element imaginable, and enough pots, pans, and cups to cook and drink it all. &nbsp;You also get a great array of green, tan, and brown parts, many of which are hard to find or exclusive. &nbsp;On top of that, you get a broom, maps, flowers, a treasure chest, several varieties of barrels, pens, and the Red Book. The only possible complaint about this set is the plates: why are they yellow?</p>

<p>Minifigures -&nbsp;Every single minifigure of this set is wonderfully designed and printed even better. &nbsp;I&#39;ll look at them one by one:</p>

<p>Gandalf is the least overwhelming of the minifigs, probably because we&#39;ve all seen him before in the cheapest LOTR set. &nbsp;Nevertheless he is &nbsp;great to have and the minifig definitely makes you think &quot;Gandalf&quot;!</p>

<p>Bilbo is quite realistic, with printing on both sides of head and body. The &quot;worried&quot; expression is particularly apt for what&#39;s going on in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part of Balin is the burgundy mini-cape, followed closely by the meticulously accurate beard. &nbsp;I rather wish the beard had been rubber, not plastic, but oh well.</p>

<p>Dwalin (my favorite dwarf in the movie) is just plain perfect, especially his huge hammer. That thing is so much fun to smash goblins with!</p>

<p>Bofur&#39;s high point, obviously, is his hat, which is ridiculously accurate to the movie. &nbsp;It unfortunately has a habit of getting in the way of his axe, but I just turn the axe sideways. Better for hacking at goblins that way anyways!</p>

<p>Bombur, with his exceptional hair/beard/tummy piece, is, in my opinion, the best minifig of the set. &nbsp;Oh yeah, and he comes with a sausage!</p>

<p>The Build -&nbsp;This set continually keeps your jaw on the floor throughout the build - especially with that big window to the left. &nbsp;That one window is the probably the most ingenious thing I&#39;ve ever seen done with ordinary Lego pieces. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike most sets, each bag of parts builds something more onto the model instead of building a new segment, giving the build a &quot;that was unexpected!&quot; quality and making it more fun than usual.</p>

<p>The Completed Model -&nbsp;The completed model is even greater than the sum of its parts. &nbsp;All I can really say is, &quot;Wow!&quot; Every aspect gives something special to the model, and I can&#39;t think of anything (disregarding the plates&#39; color) that takes away from it. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have enough thumbs to give you the thumbs-up that An Unexpected Gathering is worthy of!</p>

<p>Summary -&nbsp;You need to go buy this set now! The price tag is hefty, but the finished model is more than worth it. &nbsp;This is truly Lego&#39;s best set in history. &nbsp;Don&#39;t miss out on it!</p>

"Telcontar","2013-01-16T17:23:26.293Z","""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.""","<p>That hole was none other than Bag End.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's where The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings begin and end.&nbsp; You just couldn't have a Middle-earth theme without it.&nbsp; It's one of the most iconic images from the movie and I agree with Huw and others in that this set could be the best of all time.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nicely made showing the dwarves and Bilbo outside of Bag End.&nbsp; It is sealed with tape so don't worry box collectors!&nbsp; The instructions were folded in mine but this was OK with a couple heavy paper weights.&nbsp; (Putting them under some heavy book for a few hours would work too.)&nbsp; There are two instruction books with this set.&nbsp; The first builds the bottom half of the house and the second finishes it off.&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection in this set is one the best parts of the set.&nbsp; First of all we get tons of green bricks, slopes and more.&nbsp; There are also a fair number of tan pieces too.&nbsp; One of the new pieces are the round plates that are placed around the lattice windows.&nbsp; There's also a clear one of these for the large round window too.&nbsp; One of the highlights of this set are all the accessories, all that food!&nbsp; Dwarves really are hungry!&nbsp; There's also a few of the newer engraved bricks used in Bilbo's chimney which are very nice.&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You can't have a LEGO party without minifigures and in this set we get quite a few...</p><p><strong>Gandalf the Grey: </strong>Gandalf was the one who set&nbsp;everything in motion for this little hobbit&nbsp;so it's a good decision by LEGO to include&nbsp;him.&nbsp; I've reviewed him a couple times before but let be just say this, it's amazing how un-Gandalf-like he looks without his beard.&nbsp; The new beard piece really sells him.</p><p><strong>Bilbo Baggins: </strong>This time we get Bilbo in his tan shirt with suspenders just like the ones he wore in the movie.&nbsp; His hair piece is the same as Sam's in the Shelob Attacks set.&nbsp; His&nbsp;head is double-sided, one face is ""neutral"" while the other&nbsp;is ""worried/overwhelmed"", and he was most certainly&nbsp;was overwhelmed with all those dwarves clamoring for food...&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Balin: </strong>Balin was brother to Dwalin and he was one of the older dwarves on the journey.&nbsp; He was also the one who befriended Bilbo the most on their long journey.&nbsp; He looks fantastically accurate to the one we see in the movie with his white, almost Santa like, hair and red clothing.&nbsp; The detailing is very well done on the front and back.&nbsp; (Just as a note; Balin was the one who died in Moria and his tomb is the one the Fellowship fought around in the movie)&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Dwalin: </strong>Dwalin was Balin's brother.&nbsp; He was the toughest, strongest,&nbsp;and biggest (physically) of the&nbsp;group.&nbsp; He is wonderfully depicted in LEGO form with his accurate, green torso, beard, bald head, and cape.&nbsp; That cape is unique too, and not only for its&nbsp;color.&nbsp; Instead of two holes that slide over the torso there's only one.&nbsp; Interesting...&nbsp; He comes with his big hammer which is really fun to knock orcs over with.</p><p><strong>Bombur: </strong>While Dwalin may have been the largest of the group Bombur was the fattest.&nbsp; To show this in LEGO form his hair piece extends to cover up&nbsp;the front of his torso with an&nbsp;extra rounded section.&nbsp; Underneath&nbsp;this stomach extension is some printing but nothing to exciting.&nbsp; His face is double sided but&nbsp;when the hair&nbsp;piece is on the only difference is in his eyebrows.&nbsp; On one face they're lower while on the other they're higher.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Bofur: </strong>Bofur was one of the funniest dwarves in the movie&nbsp;during this sequence so I'm glad&nbsp;LEGO included him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides of his torso and his head are very well done but his hat is the cool part.&nbsp; It is super accurate&nbsp;to the one in the film but&nbsp;unlike most pieces it is made up of a flexible plastic.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I had more fun building this set than probably any other set I own.&nbsp; There were so many wonderful building techniques used and just watching the famous door come up was exciting to say the least.&nbsp; Instead of using a half sized baseplate you actually make one out of smaller plates. It turned out to be quite strong plus it looked better with its rounded corners.&nbsp; The removable roof was fun to build too with all of its rounded slopes and such.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished Bag End looks incredible.&nbsp; It looks more like a MOC than a LEGO set!&nbsp; From the garden out front to the green door, to Bilbo's desk in the corner,&nbsp;AWESOME JOB LEGO!&nbsp; The roof is easily removed and when that is done it is easier to play inside.&nbsp; While this set has no ""play features"" it has more playability than most sets, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; </p><p>There are a couple things added to it to make it accurate for LotR too.&nbsp; I'm thinking of two main things here, 1: The Red Book of Westmarch, this was Bilbo's book that he wrote <em>after </em>The Hobbit.&nbsp; But LEGO probably wouldn't get another chance to make it so it's OK with me.&nbsp; 2: Sting on the shelf, Bilbo didn't have Sting yet either.&nbsp; </p><p>The price isn't too bad either, it could've been a little less but it is well worth $70.</p><p>…</p>

"sudorum","2013-02-06T21:58:29.83Z","Gone Green","<p>What ultimately makes this set so visually appealing is its plethora of green brick garishness. Lego rarely incorporates bright colors to such an extent; usually only a castle set includes so many bricks of the same color, and more times than not these bricks are a dull gray or black that are merely sprinkled with vibrant colors around them. However, this abundance of green is not overwhelming, for there&#39;s so much else to notice on the exterior of the Hobbit hole. There&#39;s the brown fence and bench, the circular windows, the flowers and crops--every detail complements each other. To put it succinctly, the exterior of this set is basically flawless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior doesn&#39;t exactly disappoint either. Included inside is a table piled with goblets and plates of berries and meat, while a pretzel and loaf of bread top off the menu. Six stools provide ample seating arrangements for Bilbo&#39;s uninvited guests. Nearby is a shelf for bottles and a desk which can hold Bilbo&#39;s maps or book. Of course, there is also a fireplace and chimney with holders for pots and pans. Located on the other side of the room is a barrel and chest, as well as more shelves. Bilbo is also apparently kind of a slob, because he leaves his maps lying in a loose pile on the floor. The circular door is quite large and requires some space to open completely. Fortunately, this is only prevented if a mini-figure is placed in its path. The roof of Bilbo&#39;s modest home does have the ability to detach from the mainframe, but it&#39;s actually not necessary to do so in order to access the interior. Alas, I have to complain about the abundance of stickers. The door is the only printed brick; other details such as the wooden appearance of the fence and designs on the maps must be &quot;artificially&quot; applied. Other than this triviality, it&#39;s difficult to find something to complain about. The minifigs are <i>wunderbar</i>&nbsp;as usual and the set is decently priced. As far as Hobbit sets go, this one trumps the rest by a great deal.&nbsp;</p>

"lkb57","2014-04-29T19:20:40.213Z","An Unexpected Set that does not Disappoint!","<p>So, I&#39;ve tried to write this review several times, but I could never quite figure out how to avoid just repeating what others have said about this fantastic set (most of which I agree with). But this set is way too awesome to not say anything about it, so here goes. To set my review apart from the others, I&#39;m going to focus on how this amazing set really captures Bag End as it&#39;s described in the movies and books. So to start things off, here&#39;s Tolkien&#39;s own description of Bilbo&#39;s home:</p>

<p><em>&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.</em></p>

<p><em>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.&quot; &ndash;&ndash;The Hobbit, JRR Tolkien</em></p>

<p>In my opinion, the Lego designers have done an amazing job capturing the feel of Bag End in brick form. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>&quot;It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.&quot;</strong></em> Bilbo&#39;s front door is &nbsp;round, green plate with a printed wood-grain pattern that is unique to this set. Combined with a gold 1X1 round plate, it makes the perfect hobbit door. The fact that the designers included Gandalf&#39;s mark on the print pattern is a good example of how they really went the extra mile with every aspect of this set.</li>
	<li><em><strong>&quot;The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats&quot;</strong></em> Admittedly, the set is built out of bricks, so the &quot;tube&quot; shape is a little limited; however, the designers did a fantastic job using straight and rounded slope pieces on the exterior to give the set an organic feel. And while there are no hats or coats, there are chairs and plenty of shelves for holding bottles, books and swords. One of my favorite aspects of this set is that while it&#39;s officially in the Hobbit line, it includes little easter eggs from the LOTR books/movies. For example, underneath the main window Bilbo has a writing desk for maps and The Red Book&ndash;&ndash;his personal memoir that he only begins writing after he returns from the Lonely Mountain. And let&#39;s not forget Sting. Bilbo&#39;s trusty sword has an honored place displayed on one of his shelves. Again, the extra details really make this set stand out from the crowd.</li>
	<li><em><strong>&quot;No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage.&quot;</strong></em> Now, obviously the designers couldn&#39;t include all of these rooms . . . but they did give us a set that is chucky-jam full of accessores: dishes, cups, bottles, pans, fruit, bread, meat, maps, letters, an inkwell and a broom (to name, erm . . . most of them). All of these accessories make the set (which really only includes the entryway and the dining from) feel like a well-used, thoroughly lived-in and comfortably-cluttered Hobbit hole.</li>
	<li><em><strong>&quot;The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond&quot;</strong></em> Funny as it may sound, the windows really are one of my favorite aspects of the set. They look like they&#39;re nestled down in the hillside, peaking out of the green grass. The main window is especially clever, and incorporates a lot of fun building techniques to create the glass-pane look. Good stuff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p><br />
As is their MO, the Lego designers have created six awesome minifigs to go with the set&ndash;&ndash;and five of them are unique! Gandalf is an obligatory member of the caste of course, and the only non-unique minifig in the lot. The other five are: Bilbo, Dwalin, Balin, Bofur and Bombur. All six figs have highly-detailed printing on the front and back of their torsos as well as their heads (happy/angry faces for everyone but Bilbo, happy/nervous face for Bilbo). The only shame is that you can&#39;t really tell the difference between Gandalf and Bombur&#39;s two expressions since their beards cover most of their faces.<br />
One thing I really enjoyed about these minifigs is that they&#39;re slightly brighter in color than the costumes worn by the actual actors in the movies, so you can see their coloring better. In fact, it wasn&#39;t until I&#39;d seen the minifigs that I realized how closely the movie costume designers had kept to the coloring (if not much else) described by Tolkien.</p>

<p><em><strong><img alt="""" src=""http://www.1000steine.com/brickset/minifigs/thumbs/tn_lor001_jpg.jpg"" style=""width: 70px; height: 80px; float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" />&quot;All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></em>So yeah, Gandalf may not be a unique fig, but they definitely nailed it.</p>

<p><em><strong><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/m/lor050.jpg"" style=""width: 61px; height: 80px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;"" />&quot;It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></em>Green cloak? Check. I mean . . . maybe they fudged on some of the other details . . . but who&#39;s really judging? Not me.</p>

<p><em><strong><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/m/lor049.jpg"" style=""width: 63px; height: 80px; float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" />&quot;But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></em>They definitely got the white beard down (even if it&#39;s not your traditional dwarf&#39;s beard), and the cloak and coat are scarlet (even if the hood is missing). The guy is still my favorite dwarf from the book and movie. Hands down.</p>

<p><em><strong><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/m/lor052.jpg"" style=""width: 63px; height: 80px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;"" />&quot;Carefully! Carefully! he said. &quot;It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce . . . <img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/m/lor051.jpg"" style=""width: 60px; height: 80px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"" />Bofur [and] Bombur . . . At your service!&quot; said . . . Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up [a] yellow hood and a pale green one;&quot;&nbsp;</strong></em>Again, even if some of the details are off, the designers at least got the colors right, which is fun . . . and these two definitely make a fantastic pair. Bombur especially cracks me up.</p>

<h2>Finished Model</h2>

<p>In the end, what makes this set so great is that that the designers managed to squeeze in a TON of playability, without sacrificing the overall look of the set, or all of the fun details they&#39;ve crammed into it. This is a set that looks equally good set up for display, or spread out on the carpet where you and your kids can have fun with it. And it does it all while staying true to the fantastic descriptions provided by Tolkien and the LOTR/Hobbit movies.</p>

<p>Would I go as far as saying this is my favorite Lego set? Without a doubt. Is it (as some reviewers have hinted) the best set of all time? Well . . . yes. I believe it is. Mostly because it provides so much entertainment without breaking the $100 mark, which makes for a set that is available to a much wider audience of casual Lego fans and younger fans.</p>

<p>Should you buy it? If you haven&#39;t already, you really should. Even if you&#39;re not a huge LOTR fanatic, this is a seminal Lego set that I think will go down in history as one of the greats. As of this moment, the set is still available in stores, or online. Go out and get it!</p>

<p>Well done, Lego. Well Done.</p>

"123MrBrick","2014-08-10T02:22:02.04Z","Quite Possibly the Best Set Ever Made!","<p>I got this set a few weeks ago, and I absolutely LOVE it. This is one of the best sets I have purchased or received ever. I guarantee you will have fun with this amazing set, Hobbit fan or not!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is one of the newer higher quality ones that came around a few years ago. The front depicts the set in a fantasy situation, with some bright artwork filling the background. The front side of the box also shows the character lineup in a small box in the bottom-left hand corner. I also appreciated that the main scene shows one set of faces for the characters, and the lineup box shows the other set of expressions. My only complaint about this side is there is a bit of false advertising: Through the crack in the door, we see some wooden planks as a sort of back wall, which is not in the actual set. The back shows the features of the model, as well as some &#39;cinematic&#39; shots which is mostly just the dwarves eating! The are two instruction manuals in this set that go along with the six numbered bags.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a great parts selection in this set! We are treated to many new elements, as well as some old pieces in fresh, new colors. There are also some rare parts in their original colors, such as the pretzel and loaf of bread. My favorite is the PRINTED door to Bag-End! Also, most of the minifigures feature brand-new hair pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has an amazing cast of characters. I will start with Gandalf, because he is very common. He has is same usual printing, as always, and it is extremely accurate. There isn&#39;t much else to say about him, and I am sure most of the LOTR/Hobbit fans out there already have two or three Gandalfs. Next up is Hobbiton Bilbo. This version of Bilbo is exclusive, and features a unique torso print, as well as a different face variation. The legs are plain brown, but are unique to this version of the little hobbit. Dwalin next! This dwarf is probably the most detailed of the four. He is bald, and consequently does not have a double-sided head. We do, however, get Dwalin&#39;s tattoos printed on the back of his head. He has a new beard piece, which unfortunately covers most of his amazingly detailed torso. Dwalin also wears a green cape, which, unlike the other dwarves, has one neck hole instead of two that go over each other. This minifigure wields a brick-built battlehammer that is almost twice his size! Now on to Dwalin&#39;s older brother, Balin. Balin also features a unique beard/hair piece, as well as a two-hole red short cape. He carries a short sword like a few other members of the company, as well as Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Both sides of his torso have film-accurate printing, unfortunately covered on both sides. Time for Bofur! Bofur may be my favorite of the four, but I love them all. Bofur, instead of a beard/hair piece, has his iconic &quot;ear hat&quot;, cast in rubbery plastic. Be careful, as this is a &#39;squishy&#39; piece like Kit Fisto from the Star Wars line. Bofur has a small beard printed on his double-sided head, accurate to the movie. This means that his awesome torso printing isn&#39;t covered! (On the front). Bofur also has a brown short cape and a Pickaxe from Power Miners. Last, (and he hates being last in book and film) is Bombur. This guy stands out among the entire Company because he has a special beard/belly piece that makes him fatter. Bombur has a double-sided face and torso printing, and both are mostly covered by his beard and hair. Bombur is the cook of the Company, as he is too fat to fight, so he has cooking utensils and food items instead of a weapon.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very interesting, because you are building a hollow hill with windows and a door and such. There are many clever building techniques, like the sideways style used for the large window. It took me about an hour and a half to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. It manages to look very bright, but stay earthy at the same time. There are many, many, many small details that the designers spent a lot of time and effort on. If you read the book, you will see just how accurate and life-like Bag-End is.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set could be the best set ever made. It has outstanding minifigures, amazing playability and value, and clever building techniques. Plus, the price is great! I normally recommend sets to fans of that theme, but this time, I recommend this set to ANY fan of Lego.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-11-14T17:45:00.87Z","A beautiful set that represents both stories wonderfully!","<p>This is an absolutely incredible set that represents one of the few locations that plays a prominent role in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. While this particular set may be made as a Hobbit set, it also includes a handful of features that relate to Lord of the Rings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>With this set you get an amazing collection of minifigures, 6 to be exact. First is Gandalf who is the least exciting since you most likely already own several of him, but nonetheless is a good minifigure. Bilbo is unique to this set because he is wearing the clothes he wore at home, but since you already own many different Bilbos, I do wish however that his head featured a young an older side as that would have made the set perfect for both stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the highlight here is you get 4 dwarves. All 4 look fantastic with Bombur being my favorite with his incredible hair/beard/belly piece. Their torsos are all highly detailed, but show details of the hair that will actually cover them so you really aren&#39;t losing the details except for on the back for the ones wearing capes. The other three are Balin, Dwalin, and Bofur. Bofur&nbsp;is the only one without a brick made beard, but he has his incredible hat which more than makes up for that. Balin looks fantastic and it&#39;s great to have him given his importance and closeness to Bilbo. Dwalin in my opinion is the least interesting simply because he is bald, but he still looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set includes an amazing selection of parts. What will immediately catch you attention is all the household items such as food, pots and pans, plates, a broom, and a shovel. You get a good collection of diverse weapons. And while they may use stickers, you get 3 Middle Earth maps. After that you have tons of specialized bricks including rounded ones, large plates, foliage, a treasure chest, and I can go on and on. If for some reason you get bored with Bag End, you have plenty to build with. Of course the absolute best part is the printed door, which may not be useful elsewhere but looks amazing and is printed!</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Build</strong></p>

<p>This set has a rather interesting build utilizing a handful of different techniques and teaching me some new tricks along the way. Perhaps the most interesting part is the very simple, but very creative large window which looks completely different from the inside and the outside. It utilizes lamp holders, lazy susans (without the top part), arches, and features a built in light. Not to mention it slides into the structure and is locked in using the simplest techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that you have a handful of SNOT, particularly for creating exterior window frames. A very simple but well designed fence. You also build up a hill and a tree which is a lot of fun to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course a lot of the build is simple adding in the details such as the garden, the bench, the dinner table, but all of this is fun. Building the whole set took a little less than 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, this set covers both movies. Certainly the inclusion of 4 dwarves and the dinette set implies it is a Hobbit set. But the inclusion of the maps, Sting, and the book that Bilbo (and eventually Frodo) writes are out of place in the Hobbit and directly reference Lord of the Rings. You also have flowers outside the large window for a gardener to spy from (although sadly the window can&#39;t be opened to pull Sam through). The oven could double as a fireplace to throw the ring into, although the ring is surprisingly missing from this set, but no biggie as you must own 30 rings by now. You also have an envelope sitting on a shelve with a seal, so I suppose the ring is still inside of it!</p>

<p>In terms of actual play features, this set surprisingly has none. Although in Lego&#39;s defense, how many play features do you have in your home? Certainly there are plenty of accessories to play with, and if you own <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9469-1/Gandalf-Arrives"">Gandalf Arrives</a>, it looks fantastic parked in front of this set.</p>

<p>I would have liked to see the chandelier that Gandalf hit his head on, and it would be cool if there were one or two walls to divide the rooms and give the Hobbit hole that rounded look,&nbsp;but of course adding these would have made the house very cramped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My one complaint is that the base of the model is not very solid, plus it includes a small plate sized step in the house. By building the base out of two stacked plates they could have made it much more solid and eliminated that step. I suppose this an easy enough fix to make on my own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The design is actually very similar to the new <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21316-1/The-Flintstones"">Flintstones</a> set. I will say that the Flintstones set is much better designed, but Lego had 7 years to learn since this set came out. However, if you want to improve or build upon this set, the Flintstones set could provide some valuable insight into how this set could be improved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you are a LOTR fan, this is obviously a must have set and is well worth the money.&nbsp;</p>
