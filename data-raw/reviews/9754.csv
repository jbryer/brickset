"Harmonious_Building","2012-12-08T16:44:23.77Z","Goblin up your money.","So this set went on discount almost immediately upon release on Amazon, and what did I do? I bought it when I really shouldn't have. But you don't need to know that.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Here we have the largest set of 2013's <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings&amp;subtheme=The%20Hobbit"">Hobbit</a> line, which is, for those living under a rock in a distant cave somewhere, based on the soon-to-be released (as of writing this review, of course) first installment of the <i>Hobbit</i>&nbsp;film trilogy (sigh), a prequel of sorts to the hugely-famous Lord of the Rings. Obviously, I haven't seen this movie yet, and this is my first set from LEGO's Hobbit line, so, for better or for worse, I will be reviewing this set without comparison to the movie or other sets from this series.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Lord of the Rings sets are oddly generous with their Minifigs, and I suppose that's a good a place as any to start this review. On the side of good, you get three obscure dwarves: Ori, Nori, and Dori, which I am only able to name because I have the box right next to me as I type this. I've loved the LEGO dwarves ever since the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Fantasy%20Era"">Fantasy Era</a>, er, era, and I do have to say that these new additions are just as charming as the old ones. I suppose the biggest point of note would be their wildly-varied hairpieces, which do make a nice change from the standard ""bearded"" dwarves that we've had so far. The most recognisable member of the ""good guys"" would be our old friend Gandalf the Grey, and ""old"" would be an accurate statement on several levels. From the LEGO hobbyists point of view, the relevant description of ""old"" would be that this Gandalf is, sadly, the same Gandalf that we've already seen in this year's Gandalf Arrives (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=9469-1"">9469</a>) - undoubtedly a disappointment to some, but I guess it would be unreasonable to expect everything to be shiny and new all the time. Here's to hoping for a Gandalf the White in the near future, right?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The bad guys are somewhat generic, but, since they're nasty goblins, there's no real harm there. The two taller goblins do have different torsos, but all have the same head and ""hairpiece"", which I believe is new. But the crowning glory here is the goblin king himself, who is as marvellously ugly as they come. He is roughly comparable in size to our friendly <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=lor027"">cave troll</a>, and functions in more or less the same way - no surprises there. He looks absolutely fantastic and will prove to be more than a match for <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sh013"">Bruce Banner</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>The build for this set was actually pretty fun - the whole structure has a very chaotic feel to it, which means that there's precious little symmetry and therefore not a whole lot by way of repeated builds. The build is divided into a couple of sections: the right ramp, the goblin king's throne, and the bridge on the left, all of which are sufficiently unique that they can be stretched out over several sessions without being boring or taxing. If there is a downside to this, it would be the plethora of stickers, those dreaded things that similarly plagued The Mines of Moria (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=9473-1"">9473</a>). In retrospect, you could probably get away with not applying any of them, since the completed model provides plenty of visual interest all on its own. To me, this felt like an evolution and perfection of the aesthetic applied - with some success - to the much older Trolls' Mountain Fortress (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7097-1"">7097</a>). Non-perpendicular angles are used to the fullest degree to create a very organic look, as befitting what one would imagine goblins might build.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, the set is not shy on play features either - something that would be of interest to those planning on getting this for someone who actually plays with LEGO. There's a lot of gimmicks in here, many of which are highlighted in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NXkibpeJJ4"">official developer video</a>, but what makes them great is how well they are integrated into the set without feeling like obvious intrusions. They range from the typical ""toilet paper launcher"" on the right ramp to a clever crane mechanism that looks great and works well, so I can see this set as being a lot of fun for younger builders as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If there is any downside to this set at all, it's that the separate builds are exactly that: separate. Of course, the display can be easily arranged as depicted on the box, but they aren't held together by Technic pins or anything else. I suppose this was a deliberate choice made to preserve the angular nature of the construction, and I personally can't quite think of a way in which the problem could be easily resolved. But, I can see the rationale behind leaving the various builds as they are, so I really can't complain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a richly detailed and very fun set to have, and so I would indeed recommend it if you're even a passing fan of Tolkien, or fantasy themes in general. It's a bit pricey at the suggested retail price, so get it at a discount off of Amazon or elsewhere if you can. And if you happen to be getting this for your kids, make sure you get them to read the book too!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-15T10:44:30.673Z","Battle the Goblin King to save the Dwarves","<p>For this, my 450th review on Brickset I shall finally be able to review a truly impressively sized set as I very rarely manage to nab the more expensive stuff I'm after. This Bricktober however has allowed me, not only to invest time and money in the TRU Holiday LEGO event, but also gave a pretty decent deal slashing the price of this set in half.</p>
<p>Onwards to the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Goblin King Battle is huge, for all of LEGO's attempts at conserving space the size of this box belies its contents. At 841 pieces we are given quite a substantial cavity to hold the bags included.</p>
<p>There are three instruction booklets protected in a bag with cardboard from bending (something I'd like to see more of honestly in much smaller sets), each booklet corresponds to one of the sets of numbered bags. Book one is much smaller than the other two, it is used to build the contents of Bag #1, the pages are nicely presented with easy to follow steps.</p>
<p>Books two and three are much larger, and definitely a bit thicker, Book two is used for Bags #2 &amp; 3 and Book three is for the final two numbered bags of the set, 4 &amp; 5.</p>
<p>Overall the presentation, the fact that the instructions are protected in a seperate bag with cardboard backing to prevent creasing, bending or any other damages from just cramming a folded booklet into a box is greatly appreciated. The box itself showcases all of the set's features quite nicely from the front and back and gives a complete list of the Mini-Figures included in the set.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are a lot of nice parts included in this set, the rich dark brown colors for a lot of them are pretty impressive. I do find that there are a lot of loose bits though, you get a very large number of Dog Bones and Mini-Figure Skeleton heads to decorate the Goblin King's throne and walkways, some of which are not attached to the model but simply lie on the studs, these could be lost easily when played with for the target age range. Although to be fair most 9-14 year olds probably display their sets more often than play with them.</p>
<p>Included in this set is a nice black anchor piece, or what I assume is meant to represent a ship's anchor, this is my first time owning one of these and I'm pretty impressed by it.</p>
<p>All in all I'd have to say that this is a good set for building the primary model or MOCers looking for parts that aren't very common, such as the supports for the rope ladder or useful short chain pieces. A rather expensive parts pack though.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are seven Mini-Figures and one character in this set, each of them with unique printing on the torso, a different accessory&nbsp;and hair/head piece. The only repeat of the set (not counting the troop buildable Goblin Soldiers) is Gandalf the Grey. (Who honestly seems to be getting turned out in an awful lot of sets from both Hobbit and LotR.)</p>
<p>First up is the Dwarf Ori, at first I didn't recognize which one he was meant to represent, however after re-watching the film I realized who he was. He does a decent enough representation in Mini-Figure form of the character, my only complaint is the fact that his hairpiece is not unique enough, I believe it's Ron Weasley's hair from Harry Potter and so doesn't look exactly like the on-screen character from the film.</p>
<p>He has a rich purple colored torso with double-sided printing showing off his costume to great effect, short grey legs because he's a dwarf, a small dark grey cloth cape and a double-sided facial print (smiling happy side and terrified at being in battle side), he's also carrying a short axe made out of a wand piece and a clip-on axe blade. (In the film he is the dwarf who uses the Slingshot, in fact his torso print has the slingshot tucked into the belt on his back, a shame he didn't include a proper slingshot accessory to hold.) As I said previously his hair is Ron Weasley's, although it is in a nice dark shade of brown it doesn't accurately protray the character's hair style from the film, still it services well enough I suppose for now.</p>
<p>Nori the Dwarf is just as detailed as his fellow Dwarf, he has a richly printed double-sided torso in a brown color with grey arms, he includes darker brown short legs a double-sided face printed with a happy smile and determined grimace and a very unique looking hair piece. He has triple braids in his beard and a single braid in the back of his head, the best aspect of LEGO Hobbit Dwarves is their unique hair pieces, many of them recieved brand new pieces due to the unique nature of the characters from the film.</p>
<p>Nori carries a short sword and a large club thing built out of a staff, a 1x1 smooth silver stud and a 1x1 brick with multiple stud connectors. Overall a truly fun and diverse looking character.</p>
<p>Dori the Dwarf is the bringer of Tea from the beginning of the film. His Mini-Figure is just as impressively detailed and full of rich colors as his companions. He has a rich maroon colored torso, again with the double-sided print showing off his costume from the film. He has short dark brown legs, a nice short dark maroon cloth cape, a double sided face with regular and determined warrior looking prints and another unique hair piece. (A light shade of grey with all the braiding and sculpted detail work of the style worn by the actor in his part.)</p>
<p>Dori's accessories are a short sword and a chain with two studs on one head, perhaps a Dwarven chain-whip or mace style weapon. Overall a pretty impressive Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>Gandalf the Grey. He's Gandalf the Grey, the same Mini-Figure with the exact same accessories found in ten other sets by now (I'd wager), it would have been nice if he'd included unique printing on the torso or something to differentiate him, perhaps some scuff marks earned during the fall at the end of the battle, alas it is not to be. He is also the only Mini-Figure without a double-sided head.</p>
<p>Goblin Soldiers. Like any good army builder the Goblin Soldier is pretty much two identical Mini-Figs, their heads are both the same, with both sharing double-sided faces (the only difference in the expressions being the number of teeth and shape of the mouths honestly) and the same lower legs with loincloth printing. The true genius of these Mini-Figures is that each one has a unique torso and weapon, each torso has a different style of belt being worn by the soldier and both are double-sided of course.</p>
<p>They also have a new head piece made out of a softer rubbery plastic with limp strands of hair printed on the back, huge elf-like ears and craggy caveman-like sloping brows. One soldier carries the huge scimitar piece first introduced with Indiana Jones sets if I'm not mistaken, the other is wielding a bone axe commonly found amongst Ninjago weapons.</p>
<p>The Goblin Scribe shares the same head and hair/head piece as the other two Goblins, once again he has a unique torso printing, this time bare chested without belts and things, and has shorter brown legs indicating his size. His accessory is a smooth 2x2 flat tile with a sticker of Goblin writing placed over it.</p>
<p>Last, but not least we come to the Goblin King himself. This huge Character is much taller than typical LEGO Mini-Figures, with a static posed Torso/Leg combined piece and attachable arms that rotate showing off hulking flabby muscles. He's sculpted quite faithfully to the grotesque image seen on screen, with a brown loincloth around his legs and scraggly hair around his head, the facial printing is suitably ugly and once again faithful to his on-screen counterpart.</p>
<p>He carries a huge club made up of several pieces, three black soft-tipped spike pieces sit around his sculpted crown detailing to complete the malevolent look and, much like similar large sized characters, the Goblin King can hold a regular Mini-Figure in either hand.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say you get a lot of excellent Mini-Figures in this set, the exception being plain and found everywhere Gandalf.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>As I mentioned up above you build this set in three stages, first is booklet #1, which covers one half of the walkway and some of the Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>The second phase involves building up the large throne the Goblin King sits on, and in fact this is where the bulk of the peices will be found.</p>
<p>The third booklet builds up the walkway area with the rope bridge, and the Goblin Scribe's little moving basket section.</p>
<p>Each phase involves fairly easy to follow steps, there are naturally stickers used for detail work on some of the peices and a few of the areas might appear fragile at first glance, but once all the pieces are in place everything holds together surprisingly well. The targeted age range should have no trouble building this unsupervized, younger siblings who may be interested in it below the 9 YO recommended starting age for the set may need some help.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished model is pretty good at representing the area surrounding the Goblin King, it features a few play features of course, there's a moveable barrel on a winch that can be raised and lowered where the Goblin Scribe sits. You can push out the ladder leaning against one side to throw off pursuing Goblins, the rope bridge can be knocked out of position with a simple push pin piece that can trap the dwarves in a pitfall.</p>
<p>One side features a small catapult and beneath the Goblin King's throne are two items, one slides out a tempting treasure to trick the Dwarves while the other causes a buildable cage to fall over and (in theory) trap a dwarf. (I'm not sure if it works all that well.)</p>
<p>The model's only failing grace is it's lack of proper connections for the three seperate pieces, there are no click-in areas for modular connectibility instead all three sections (Walkway, Throne and Rope Bridge area) are seperate. This does mean it's easier to move the set around for quick changes of display layouts, however the slightest jostling will cause the seperate sections to fall out of alignment meaning that you'll have to be careful about knocking the shelf around. (Or display table or dresser or wherever you might choose to place it.)</p>
<p>You also need to be careful how you pick up the Goblin King's throne when moving it, as it does suffer a bit from ungainly appearance and no good hand holds.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>To summarize, this is an excellently detailed set with some great (and necessary) Mini-Figures to complete the Dwarf Company. It captures the scene of the film it's imitating quite nicely and doesn't suffer from too many issues, it also includes a handy-dandy brick seperator in orange.</p>
<p>Overall though I would caution you that this is not a set designed properly for young children to play with, it's a display piece and an expensive one to boot. At regular price it will set you back 130$, but it is crucial in order to complete your dwarven company. (Provided that none of the 2013 Hobbit Desolation of Smaug sets include the three dwarves in this set.)</p>
<p>It looks great once put together, but it's still a bit weak because the model doesn't stick together and is just three re-arrangable sections that have limited variations for how you place them. It would have been nice if there were more Goblin's to go with it, perhaps before this Theme is finished we'll get a Goblin Army set similar to the Uruk-Hai Army sets of LotR to expand the army.</p>
<p>I will say though that this and Riddles for the Ring complement one another nicely, you can fit both sets together on a shelf and they'll be a great little Under the Mountain display to represent The Hobbit's first film. I am still a bit confused as to why the designers chose to have one loose Skeleton Head and a few bones sitting off to the side with a tiny buildable lamp instead of including them on the model proper somewhere. As those would be first to get lost I'd surmize.</p>
<p>Still, this is highly recommended for completists, fans of the films/franchise and Mini-Figure collectors.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"Chilly","2014-04-11T22:37:39.807Z","Ah Goblin King, you make me vomit.","<p>I got this set for Christmas but never opened it until now for some strange reason.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><b>Box:</b></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to say apart what&#39;s below.</p>

<p>Age: 9-14.</p>

<p>Set number: 76010.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>There are three instruction booklets which have a cream colour&nbsp;scheme with a map in the background.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I think 841 pieces for &pound;79.99 is a good price, especially for a licensed set. This set has the most skulls in a LEGO set that I&#39;ve ever seen, thirteen to be exact. Another strange thing set is that it comes with a random anchor that I don&#39;t remember from the movie. Other notable pieces are a pitchfork, a large rock, bucket and a bucket handle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>The Goblin King:</strong> <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor042/Goblin-King"">The Goblin King</a>&nbsp;Is basically&nbsp;a walking pile of fat. He has eight pieces excluding his weapon. He can move his arms and his wrists. Both of his hands can hold weapons or anything else the King&#39;s fatty heart desires.</p>

<p><strong>Two Goblin soldiers:&nbsp;</strong>The two goblins have a slight difference, one of them has some <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor043/Goblin-Soldier-1"">chain around it&#39;s torso</a> and the other <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor032/Goblin-Soldier-2"">ropes on him</a>. One of them has a sword and the other has an axe made with a bone. They both have double-sided heads with slight differences.</p>

<p><strong>Goblin scribe:&nbsp;</strong>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor044/Goblin-Scribe"">goblin scribe</a>&nbsp;is smaller than the goblin soldiers. He has short dark brown legs, a different torso than the soldiers and the same face as the soldiers though.</p>

<p><strong>Gandalf the grey: </strong>This version of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor001/Gandalf-the-Grey-Wizards-Hat"">Gandalf</a>&nbsp;is common figure which is included in four sets including a polybag. He has a sword and his staff. Gandalf has a beard and a beard which fit in between his head and his torso.</p>

<p><strong>Ori:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor045/Ori-the-Dwarf"">Ori</a>&nbsp;has an axe&nbsp;which uses the short stick which is rarer than the ones used for things like the wands in Harry Potter sets. Speaking of Harry Potter sets his hair is a reddish brown version of Ron Weasley&#39;s hair from the original Harry Potter sets. He has a double-sided head, one side is happy and the other is screaming.</p>

<p><strong>Nori:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor046/Nori-the-Dwarf"">Nori</a>&nbsp;has a hammer and a sword which is different from Gandalf&#39;s as it is smaller. His hair piece is very unique and was especially&nbsp;made for this set. He has a double-sided head, one side is happy and the other is angry.</p>

<p><strong>Dori:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor047/Dori-the-Dwarf"">Dori</a>&nbsp;Han has a sword the same as Nori&#39;s and a short chain which is seen multiple times in this set. His hair piece is unique and like Nori&#39;s hair is exclusive to this set. He has a double-sided head, one side with a basic expression and the other with an angry expression.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much to say about the build other than it was a good build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks a lot like it did in the movie and is quite accurate. There are quite a bit of play features such as an area where you can free a dwarf from a cage, a function where you push the black part at the back part of the throne, hidden treasure will be revealed, the bridge can collapse, you can push some one of the ladder, you can adjust what I assume is a outlook of some sort and there is a catapult.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is an overall good set. It has plenty of features to keep young LEGO fans happy. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t open it earlier than I did. I would recommend&nbsp;this to any LEGO hobbit fan.</p>
