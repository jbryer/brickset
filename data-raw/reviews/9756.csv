This single DVD release was originally released in 2012 and I have finally acquired it. I recall watching these in passing at the time of their initial release, but I haven&rsquo;t seen them in quite a long time, so finally picking up this set and re-watching the start of the massive LEGO Phenomena is definitely welcome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The case for this DVD is loaded with identifiers. You see Sensei Wu and the four ninja with their original Golden Weapons of Creation, these are not the weapons as seen in the episodes, but the actual physical LEGO toys you built in the 2011 range of LEGO Ninjago sets. Garmadon is on the back and a nice write-up of the premise of this film. It&rsquo;s a fairly decent package.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again, there were no bonus items of LEGO included with these DVD releases. In point of fact I&rsquo;m surprised LEGO didn&rsquo;t offer bonus builds with all these DVD releases, though I suppose it could be because they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to continue manufacturing and selling them if they had bonus items attached.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The animation of the two pilot episodes is considerably dated compared to the series as seen on television these days. That doesn&rsquo;t mean this is a bad release, or anything like that, it just means that the animation of LEGO Ninjago has improved considerably since the early days of the series. It&rsquo;s a lot more fluid these days and the ninja action is actually more believable, these earlier episodes are considerably less polished in the action front and you can see some clunky fights.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There is an odd bonus short showcasing some animation errors packaged as some kind of behind-the-scenes bad takes. It&rsquo;s really not the best compared to other LEGO bonus shorts, but it&rsquo;s something to watch along with the two main episodes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO Ninjago Masters of Spinjitzu is the first in a long line of television series from LEGO and Warner Brothers. Atlantis was a special TV short released around the same time, but Ninjago took off wildly, even better than Bionicle in some circles. This release is a fairly budget title, so trying to get it on sale if you&rsquo;re new to the LEGO Ninjago series and want to watch these older seasons I&rsquo;d recommend picking it up that way. I really think the storyline is pretty imaginative and works fairly well. Unfortunately the price for a single disc even these days is a little bit high considering the content you get here. Finding a compilation release with more to watch might be a better option, but I haven&rsquo;t seen this release outside the single disc release at this time. Recommended on sale.</p>
