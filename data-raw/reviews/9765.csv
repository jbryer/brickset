<p>Sales however seem to have contributed to the Theme slowly dying out as the time between films was filled with less and less set releases, in fact LEGO skipped the Half-Blood Prince completely and only one set was made for Order of the Pheonix.</p>
<p>Harry Potter had the same potential as other licensed Themes, unfortunately the delays between films led to its slow decline. And when it came back for Deathly Hallows in 2010 it really managed to give us some great new designs and new sets, in the end though it still failed to last as long as it could have and LEGO pulled the plug on the entire Theme by the end of 2011. This book was the final release, does it really work as the capper to the Harry Potter Theme? Partly yes, partly no.</p>
<p>First of all this book is a Mini-Figure character encyclopedia for LEGO Harry Potter, the problem is when you look at this licensed Theme and then look at other Themes there just aren't enough Mini-Figures to fill an entire book. So they included all of the creatures and other items, some stuff like the Sorting Hat and the Mandrake which honestly really make poor additions to the book. Especially since the book has no pages that show off every single Mini-Figure in a checklist or group shot. That might not seem like much, however it would have added at least a page or two so you could just see them all together instead of missing some duplicate Mini-Figures just because they are the same with only minor variations between years.</p>
<p>The book is still pretty ok, it allows you to at least read information on the characters and creatures, you get to see just how LEGO managed to make some interesting and not-so impressive buildable versions of creatures from the film series. It's a real shame that the Fawkes piece has never been used again in any LEGO Castle or Fantasy based sets.</p>
<p>As is standard with LEGO DK Books there is a bonus Mini-Figure included, it's Harry Potter dressed in the suit he wore to the Slughorn Christmas Party (or possibly the dinner). So basically the final Mini-Figure made for this Theme is Harry Potter, there's nothing special about him. Oh sure he has a unique print, unfortunately I would have preferred to see something else, anything else. A ton of Characters were featured in the games, why not take this time to give us a unique character that never appeared in any of the sets? Moaning Myrtle, Nearly Headless Nick, Rita Skeeter (she didn't come in any sets right? Nope, according to the book no Rita Skeeter), heck a new Tom Riddle with proper pink colored flesh tones would have been better to get. It would have made a completely unique Mini-Figure to close out the Theme, sadly this is just a wasted potential.</p>
<p>Overall this Book is a decent enough one if you like Mini-Figures and Mini-Figure based Character Encyclopedias. There's a lot of decent information, there are a few minor mistakes a few things that the Editor missed, I can't recall what it was off the top of my head but it was a very obvious error.</p>
<p>I still recommend this book, for the content at any rate, however I'm extremely disapointed that LEGO let the Harry Potter Theme, which had a load of potential, just fade away. I understand that perhaps the sales just weren't there, considering they waited such a long time between films to bring more in, I mean there were years between releases and we never even got an Aunt Petunia or Dudley Dursely, two major characters from Harry's world. Oh well, I certainly hope they don't let licensed Themes linger too long with such wasted potential, most of the Disney Themes seem to have shorter lifespans and I suspect it's because of what happened with Harry Potter.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,3
