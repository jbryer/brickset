<p>I received mine this week, just days after placing the order. I thought it&#39;d be worth doing a quick review so that those of you who may have more difficulty getting hold of it can judge whether it&#39;s worthwhile doing so.</p>

<p>Before taking a look at this set, it&#39;s worth remembering that the last police helicopter of this size, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7741-1"" title=""View set details"">7741</a>,&nbsp;came out in 2008 and is still&nbsp;being sold from shop.LEGO.com, some&nbsp;5 years after its introduction. Clearly there&#39;s demand for such a model. I wonder why, then, LEGO made this one an airline-special given its likely popularity.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>The first thing you notice about airline specials is that they come in small boxes because, of course, space is at a premium in aircraft and their duty-free trollies. As you can see below the sets 112 parts are packed in tightly and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to learn that they are packed by hand due to the need to fold the bags.</p>

<p>There&#39;s three unnumbered bags, one sticker sheet and an instruction book all packed into the small box.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The set contains two police pilots which are adorned with &#39;Forest police&#39; unifoms. The one on the left is, apparently, unique, although his head is fairly common.</p>

<h2>The helicopter</h2>

<p>The helicopter is a reasonable design but an unchallenging build. The use of 6-wide wheel arches above the side doors is effective.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one wierd thing about it that I don&#39;t like at all, though. The winch is operated by spinning the rotors. That means you can&#39;t given them a good push prior to swooshing it because the string either reaches its limit, causing the rotors to &#39;stall&#39;, or the hook is lowered and the string gets in the way. A bit of a strange design decision, but I suppose it keeps it simple.</p>

<p>The stickers haven&#39;t been applied but it&#39;s still unmistakable as a police helicopter due to the livery.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>Although it&#39;s one of the least appealing <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/brickLists/?6141"">airline specials of recent years</a>, it&#39;s not a bad model. It would certainly keep a child occupied for an hour or two on a long haul flight which is, of course, what they are designed for.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re a collector of airline specials, there&#39;s no compelling reason to go out of your way to track it down or pay&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?itemID=117208"">a ridiculous sum </a>for it. But, if you see it in the brochure whilst on-board a plane, snap it up!</p>
