I found the previous three sets in the series - 10199 Toy Shop, 10216 Bakery, and 10222 Post Office - to be excellent bookshelf decorations for my new apartment, and looked forward to adding yet another set. And Winter Cottage, by being more substantial than the other sets, and being a home rather than a storefront, adds a very different twist to the collection. I am happy with this set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is sized similar to other Winter Village sets, and this being a larger set with more pieces, is more full inside. I like the way some of the mischievous scenes have been portrayed on the rear of the box (especially the children pranking Grandpa).</p><p>Instructions, plus three stickers, are enclosed in a cardboard-backed bag. Some of the previous Winter Village sets did not have the backing, and the sticker sheet came out of the box crumpled. Fortunately, not here. The instructions are divided into two booklets, and are very easy to understand.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Some interesting choice of parts. There are some white 1x8 bricks and reverse-sloped pieces that make up the heavy snowfall appearance of the roof. The colors used for the parts are very pleasant, especially the sky blue of the walls, the red/green of the living room rug, the checkered tiles of the kitchen, the light green of the kitchen countertops, and the dark blue of the snowplow truck.</p><p>There are some interesting ""brick"" parts in beige, that are 1x2 bricks with brick texture on the side. They are used strategically here and there, especially for the foundation and some random chimney sections.</p><p>None of the parts are outright unusual or exotic, but the usage of common parts in unusual yet pleasant colors, plus using them to make interesting objects such as a Christmas tree or various toys, is awesome. Although I don't do MOCs, if I were to do one this set could provide many excellent parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are eight minifigures.</p><p></p><ul><li>Mom: the red corseted top and the black pants were seen on one of the minifigures of 10218 Pet Shop from the Modular Buildings line, but combining that look with the black bob hair and a more expressive face makes for a nicer looking minifigure, IMO. And I like her because she looks a lot like me.</li><li>Dad: I like his look, which consists of dark blue flannel shirt, beige pants, dark red cap, and a full beard. He is the workaholic and is normally expected to be out in the tool shed chopping tree logs.</li><li>Grandpa: Typical old man look with a green sweater, brown pants, and gray hair. He has a mustache. He has two possible faces - standard and angry - and the latter one works fine with those prankster grandchildren.</li><li>Grandma: aside from her beige hair, she looks too young to be a grandmother. The gray blazer with maroon scarf and the dark blue slacks are a nice outfit.</li><li>The three children: they consist of a smiling boy in a helmet, a grinning (or alternately, weeping) boy with red hair and green jacket, and a brown-haired girl with freckles. Two of the three children come with cross-country skis. The girl's torso, which consists of light blue jacket, violet scarf, gray belt, and white gloves, is identical to the one for the blonde woman in 10222 Post Office.</li><li>Snowplow driver: he appears to be separate from the family, and he comes with stubbly beard, gray beanie cap, and red shirt and green overalls. The red shirt/green overall outfit was also seen on the toy maker in 10199 Toy Shop, as well as the window washer in 10211 Grand Emporium (Modular Buildings).</li></ul>These minifigures look great, even better when mixed with the other Winter Village sets and their minifigures. This set additionally comes with two animals - a ginger cat and a brown owl.<p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>While other Winter Village sets took me 2-3 hours to assemble, this one, due to the higher piece count, took me six, over a sleepless, angst-ridden night right before a weekend trip. (No, I wasn't angry because of this set, it was a different reason.)</p><p>The piece bags are numbered into three groups. Group 1 consists of Dad, Snowplow Driver, Boy in Helmet, and Girl, as well as the igloo, the tool shed, the snowplow truck, and the sled. Group 2 consists of Mom, Grandpa, Grandma, and Redheaded Boy, plus the cottage itself minus its roof. Group 3 is strictly the roof parts.</p><p>There are no unusual build techniques involved here, though this is certainly a set with many small pieces and the Age 12+ designation is right on. The SNOT technique is well used for the tool shed, to fasten the chopped logs (1x1 cylindrical brick on its side) to the shed wall. The bedroom attic window for the cottage itself is also an interesting build, and uses hinge pieces to attach to the exterior of the roof.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I love it. The cottage itself is especially awesome - the kitchen with its tiles and appliances, the living room with Grandpa's lounge chair, Christmas tree, and fireplace stockings, and the attic bedroom with its stock of toys. The fireplace itself is where this set's illuminated 2x3 brick (common to all Winter Village sets) is located, being lit from outside the cottage to light up the transparent orange and yellow pieces that stand for the flames.</p><p>The igloo is an interesting build; the roof can be removed, and the interior reveals a stove (!). Perfect place for one of the kids to hide in.</p><p>The snowplow truck is the best Lego vehicle I've ever built first-hand. It is sizable with enough details, I love the color scheme, and the snowplow itself can be either attached to the front or stowed on the bed.</p><p>The snowplow truck, the igloo, the sled, and the toys all add up to countless play possibilities. It definitely takes a grownup (or a teen) to build it, but when it's all said and done, kids will certainly have a blast with the results.</p><p>The cottage's footprint is 16x32, or half of a standard Lego baseplate. In other words, if there is a sizable Lego City or Town collection, this set could conceivably be dropped right into the town layout.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I loved the previous Winter Village releases, and I love this one too. The price has risen to $99.99, but the additional details in the interior, plus the play possibilities, make the set worth the price.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Chills","2012-12-03T10:38:40.807Z","A warm, cozy cottage perfect for a winter holiday","<p>First off I just finished reading the previous review, written by skinnylawyer, and there's not much I can add to it. That review was great and covered pretty much everything. However, I'm on a mission to review every set I build so here goes.</p><p>This is my first Winter Scene set, and I was quite impressed with it. Having over 1400 pieces I figured it would be a little bigger, but LEGO put those pieces to use in the details. This set has a ton of them!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First of all there is a ton of playability with this set. You get a great house, a truck with a snow plow, an igloo, a work shed, and a sled, plus lots of mini figures with assorted accessories. The snowplow/truck has a great old-timey feel to it, and is a fun build. The details, like mudflaps, a roof that detaches easily for the driver, the plow pops off the front and stows on the bed, gas tanks, and I really liked how LEGO designed the mirrors, pretty creative.</li><li>Pro 2: The igloo and tool shed are nice touches. The igloo has a removable roof and a stove inside. The sides have alternating angle and round bricks, to give it a rough and non-uniform feel, like a real igloo. The tool shed uses some of the same building techniques as the main house, like the appetizer before the entree it gives you a taste of things to come. There is a stack of logs on the outside and a couple of walls missing, presumably to access the inside. There are also a number of tools for our LEGO folks to use.</li><li>Pro 3: The minifigures are fantastic! There are 8 of them, plus an owl and cat; all great additions for one's collection. Skinnylawyer does a great job reviewing all the figures, but I'll add that they also have cool accessories. There are toys for the kids, a newspaper for grandpa, a chainsaw, a slick little sled, a bucket, two sets of skis/poles, and more.</li><li>Pro 4: The house is just a terrific, detailed, fun set to build. It has a very alpine feel to it, and LEGO used a combination of powder blue and dark brown bricks for most of the structure. There are plenty of Christmas decorations, like bows, garland, stockings by the fireplace, and a cool tree filled with ornaments. The exterior has snow piled in the right places, and a lights strung along the top. Inside you have a kitchen complete withs stove, cupboards, frying pan, a sink, and a checkered floor. The building step for the floor is fun. The living room has a wonderful fireplace, which is where the light brick is used to give the room a warm glow. The detail continues with a big comfy chair, a chandelier, and a floor that looks like a soft carpet. Upstairs is the bedroom with a bed and night stand.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: It would be nice to have a door on the tool shed; to just close it off so it's not so open.&nbsp;</li><li>Con 2: The window box on the roof that extends from the bedroom doesn't look into the bedroom, the roof isn't open behind it; I would have designed the house so it does this.</li></ul>
<p>I gave this set 5 bricks because it is truly a fantastic set. It is well designed, chock full of detail, lots of playability, neat colors for the bricks, and for the number of pieces you get its a pretty good price. My collection is pretty much exclusively Star Wars, but this set is definitely worth the space on my shelf. However, during the holidays it has a place in the family room with the rest of the decorations. Now I must collect the other Winter Village sets! I would recommend this set to anyone who loves LEGO. It is be fun for teens and adults alike.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Hylocera","2013-06-07T23:17:03.1Z","Winter Fun!","<p>So I'm writing this review a bit late, considering the Winter Village Cottage was released about 1/2 a year ago and is no longer sold, but if you come across one on eBay or BrickLink, this review's for you...</p><p>Let's start at the top. Overall I'm pretty happy with this set, it had some nice elements and playability functions. There's not a whole lot to complain about, considering you're getting 1490 pieces for only $100.</p><p>The building was for the most part basic; the igloo, shed, and cottage itself mainly involved building up from the ground in the classic brick-by-brick style, nothing fancy. The gable on the left doesn't actually open into the house; it's sealed off by the roof...yeah might want to fix that. The truck was well done though, and turned out to be one of my favorite parts of the set. One thing that was fun was all the holiday decorations, especially the small Christmas tree included inside the cottage. It almost left me wanting to add more to the house from my own collection.</p><p>This set came with a wide range of nice parts, from a 3x2 light brick, sand green tiles (used to top the sink and cabinets inside), 1x1 round tiles in at least 5 different colors, the list goes on. It also came with an abundance of what I believe to be one of the first appearances of dark tan 2x1 brick pieces, which line the foundations of the tool shed + cottage. And animals. Don't forget the fancy multicolor owl. Or the orange cat.</p><p>Playability...in and of itself the Winter Village Cottage didn't boast much in this category; it had a truck with wheels that spun, a light brick that turned on, and a door that opened/closed. However, I found one way of making things extremely fun simply using parts included in the set. What I did was I removed the roof sections of the cottage, and supported it at about a 45 degree angle with a stack of 1x2 bricks. This created a crude, although amazingly successful ski slope, and allowed the interior of the cottage to be played with easily.</p><p>Value for money gets a bit complicated. So let's start off with not complicated. You're getting 15 pieces per dollar (in the US, at least) with this set. A good piece count IMO is 10 per dollar/1:10 cents. If you're like me and mercilessly shred sets apart after a short display period and use the remains of said sets to create new MOC's, then this set is both good and bad.&nbsp;The reason the Winter Village Cottage achieved such a high piece count is because of the details on the walls. You can make out most of them even from the thumbnail. But such detail requires lots of small parts, like 1x1's, 1x2's, 1x1's with clips at the ends, cheese wedges, etc. Such pieces have, in most cases,&nbsp;low ""use-ability"". This set does make for an excellent display piece, though. It took me a year and a half to bring myself to tear down the detailed Grand Emporium, and with something as breathtaking as this...it's staying on the shelf for a long, long time.</p><p>I was going to upload some pics along side this review, but I don't know how to give URL's to my photos. :/</p><p>So, all in all, this is an extremely fun/good set, if you can grab one of these for under $150 that's a steal; but under $200 is still pretty&nbsp;reasonable. Cheers! - D B</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"av8r1973","2012-12-17T22:21:26.48Z","Great set - not just for the holidays","As the other reviews mention, this set really does have it all. &nbsp;Unique build methods, very pleasing colors, incredible details and a lot of playability. &nbsp;I skipped the prior winter models, but may go back to find them now. &nbsp;This house fits well within my City, though it's only snowy near this house and the Advent sets.<div><br>My 5 and 7-year old daughters built this with me. &nbsp;The 7-year old built the first bag, which consisted of the igloo, toolshed, truck and sleigh. &nbsp;I built the second bag which was the main house structure. &nbsp;The third bag was primarily the roof and my 5-year old put that together after some clarification from me. &nbsp;It was a bit outside of her comfort level, but she did very well.</div><div><br></div><div>The other reviews cover the set in more detail, but I'll hit on the things that stuck out to me.</div><div><br></div><div>1. The truck - very unique looking vehicle. &nbsp;Unlike any other truck in my City collection. &nbsp;The snowplow is a bit fragile, but brilliantly executed. &nbsp;The flatbed is great and the choice in wheels and tires really makes the truck stand out. &nbsp;The blue and tan color combo is very complimentary to the set, as well.</div><div><br></div><div>2. The igloo - this was entirely&nbsp;unnecessary for the set. &nbsp;If it wasn't there, nobody would miss it. &nbsp;Even the two skiers could have been left out and the price could have remained the same. &nbsp;This is precisely why I'm glad they are there. &nbsp;LEGO put a lot of thought into this set and didn't skimp on details (another reason other brick manufacturers can't touch LEGO's success). &nbsp;The detail on the igloo is great and it adds life to the kit.</div><div><br></div><div>3. The sleigh - nice use of shovels. &nbsp;Very creative and the end result is a useful sled to tow the Christmas tree around in.</div><div><br></div><div>4. Kitchen - Detail is simply amazing. &nbsp;From the oven to the drawers and wall cabinets, this rocks! &nbsp;I wish the modular buildings had this level of thought in them. &nbsp;This is by far the most realistic interior in any LEGO set I have built.</div><div><br></div><div>5. Living room - the fireplace is amazing. &nbsp;Simply amazing. &nbsp;Excellent use of the light brick and the end result is beautiful and inviting. &nbsp;Sitting in the chair, reading the paper next to the tree and in front of the crackling fire. &nbsp;Such realism and life breathed into this room.</div><div><br></div><div>6. Upstairs bedroom - the toy collection this kid has is enviable. &nbsp;I loved the mini sailboat and airplane. &nbsp;These were cool builds. &nbsp;Again, this room was warm and inviting.</div><div><br></div><div>7. &nbsp;Roof - the roofs easily flip open for play or display of the rooms. &nbsp;They are substantial and not fragile at all. &nbsp;The geometry and math to figure out what and how many pieces are required is right on.</div><div><br></div><div>8. Minifigs - 8 of the little guys. &nbsp;Some neat double-faced folks, kids and adults with some great accessories. &nbsp;Chainsaws, axes, skis, etc... &nbsp;Again, these are details that could have been left out, but they weren't.</div><div><br></div><div>I honestly didn't find anything wrong with this set. &nbsp;Each step along the build, my smile widened. &nbsp;I was extremely pleased with the final result. &nbsp;This set will remain on display year-round. &nbsp;At $99, it was also attainable. &nbsp;Not the cheapest per-piece price, but a lot of bang for the buck.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"tppytel","2013-01-02T19:38:06.833Z","Taking the Winter Village to another level","<p>Other reviewers have done an excellent job describing this set in detail. I would only add the more general observation that this set is a clear step up from the other (already excellent) Winter Village sets. Lego didn't just make a bigger Toy Shop or Post Office here. This set is chock full of truly creative modeling and clever details - the fireplace, the kitchen range, the bows and garlands, the snowplow, the streetlamp, and many more. The other Winter Village sets were excellent already, but Lego really showered this one with design love. Anyone who's enjoyed the earlier sets shouldn't hesitate to spring for this one, and anyone who starts here should understand that the others don't quite reach these heights.</p><p>Of course, the price of all this (beyond just the extra money) is a much longer and more complex build, and that may or may not be a great thing given this set's seasonal and family-oriented nature. My son (5yo) is just getting to the point of building 100-piece sets mostly by himself, and I'm hoping he'll be able to take over some of the Winter Village building duties in the next couple of years. But I'll be building this one myself for some time to come - apart from the plow and igloo, the cottage itself has so many tiny bits and tricky alignments that it's only suitable for older kids and grown-ups. Finally, I'd note that finding 5-6 hours to build this during the holiday season is not quite as easy as one might imagine. :)&nbsp;</p><p>Truly an amazing set, on par with the modular buildings and other enthusiast-level offerings.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Citybricks","2012-12-28T14:45:37.303Z","Snowplow!","<p>I bought this set at the lego store for $130. It intrigued me, and it is one of my favourite sets</p>

<li>SNOWPLOW! 
<li>Nice Shed 
<li>Easy Build

"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-02T22:10:34.653Z","Great details","<p>The Winter Village Cottage is indeed a great looking house. I like the alpine architecture with the steep rooftop, contrasted beams, and cool colors. Tons of great details in the model, including snowbanks, snow-covered roof, cozy living room with back-lit fireplace, floor mosaic, Christmas tree, Christmas light, chandelier, kitchen, etc. The igloo and wood shack are interesting too, although less so than the house. The minifigs are fine, but not particularly unique - I think they represent a 3-generational family. The vintage-looking snowplow truck with its driver would make a nice set on its own, but feel a bit awkward in this set.</p>

<p>The build is not overly complex, but does take some time to complete. The floor mosaic tiles take a while to arrange in place (just like a real mosaic). The parts selection is very nice with lots of white bricks and color elements. The only thing that I don&#39;t like about the set is that the couch in the living room is not attached to the floor (which has no studs) so it slides back and forth when you pick up the house.</p>

<p>This set is one of the best Winter Village sets with a detailed house that compares well to the LEGO modular building sets. If you are looking to pick up one or two of the winter village sets, this one should be towards the top of your list.</p>

"sandune","2015-08-28T13:46:52.607Z","Great Scene","<p>This winter village cottage completes&nbsp;my Christmas village which is on top of my chest every year!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The piece colors are a bit awkward, with two blue buildings. But Lego made a very good job making the blue look nice still.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I noticed that the lumber jack minifigure is apparently&nbsp;supposed to be a rare minifigure from another set, so it&#39;s good to get him again here! Otherwise the figures are all quite typical.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very complex compared to most LEGO sets but I still&nbsp;enjoyed building it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looked amazing when finished. I like the look of the igloo but I dislike how even a short minifigure can&#39;t stand up inside, but I guess it would look weird if they made it any taller. The house looks great on the outside, but I&#39;m a bit concerned about the inside. First of all the floor has no studs so all the furniture moves around when I pick up the house. Also, there is no ladder going up to the loft. Nevertheless,&nbsp;I am&nbsp;happy that they at least have a loft included in the house.&nbsp;I am also happy that they got a light up fireplace in the cozy living room section.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a nice&nbsp;Christmas scene for your winter village. It is particularly useful as you need at least one house in a village!</p>
