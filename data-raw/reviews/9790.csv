"Odeinoichus","2012-12-02T20:18:32.043Z","To Build or not to Build","<p>Set #8833 Actor: Series 8 Mini-Figs have given us some pretty interesting ones, we've finally gotten a decent Santa, we had an awesome re-use of AC parts in the Alien Villainess and you can't go wrong with Fairies or DJs.</p>
<p>This is the Actor, a great new Mini-Fig from Series 8 introducing a brand new piece from LEGO, a neck frill that can be used in any number of interesting MOCs. Many have considered this to represent the character of Bill Shakespere, I think it could also stand in for Hamlet if you'd like.</p>
<p>The printing on this Mini-Fig is pretty impressive with a brilliant gold design on a dark green torso (a rare color for Mini-Fig torsos) which extends into his upper leg printing. Another rare sight is the fact that this Mini-Fig has two different colors for his legs, the upper legs&nbsp;are dark green matching the torso and the lower are brown. There's also a double-print on his head, one side with a raised brow and curious/questioning expression while the other side is terrified of what he's discovered. (His accessory of course, which is an extra skeleton Mini-Fig head.)</p>
<p>Overall a great looking Mini-Fig who has the potential for a lot of interesting parts swapping in MOCs. About the only thing I think could make this guy better would be a printed tile script of the play he's performing.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2021-08-07T15:57:44.733Z","actor","<p>The fourteenth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Actor, or Thespian, as some people call him. He includes 7 pieces, retailed for three dollars, and was released back in 2012. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that smooth, long hair piece. Believe it or not, this was not new to the figure whatsoever, and was actually a piece made back in around 2000-2001, if I&#39;m not mistaking. It fits the figure, and I love just how smooth it is all around, even on top.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has a fantastic expression, where he looks fittingly dramatic. The little goatee and moustache are nice touches, as is the expressionful eyebrows. He actually does include an alternate face, which is pretty amazing. It&#39;s a good expression as well, where he looks very frightened.</p>

<p>Next is that little neck frill,&nbsp;which is a great piece included with the figure. I love the moulding in all the little creases, and it was new for the figure as well.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which sports some good detail. I like the buttons down the middle, as well as the gold accents on both sides. He has no back printing, however, which is kind of sad.</p>

<p>Finishing off the framing of the figure itself, we have those legs. The detail on them is great, especially considering all the green is printed. I like the gold printed over it, and he even has green side-leg printing.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessory, which is that LEGO Minifigure skeleton head. I suppose it might be a fitting accessory, given that I have no knowledge on Shakespeare lore whatsoever. It does appear rather boring, though, since it is just the typical skeleton head print.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I do like the fresh idea of having an actor figure, but it was sort of a bad choice, considering the lack of any iconic actor icons in pop culture. That problem affects the figure itself, where he looks a little on the boring side. But with that being&nbsp;said, he isn&#39;t bad by any means. So overall, I think I&#39;m gonna give him a 3&nbsp;out of 5. That is it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
