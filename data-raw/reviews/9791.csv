The DJ and this bland little dude, whose duplicate will soon have a nice new home with a friend of mine across the sea.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this Mini-Fig? Well to be perfectly honest I don't find myself hating him or anything, but when it comes to LEGO Collectible Mini-Figures I prefer to have a bit more of a unique feel to them. It's all well and good to re-use parts in order to get rid of them or something, however I feel that LEGO missed the mark with this one. If anything this MF should have been a Pirate Captain using one of the PotC Tri-Corner Captain hats and hair pieces from Barbossa or someone.</p>
<p>Detail wise he's got a decent looking level of detail, there's no denying that this Mini-Fig looks and dresses the part. He's got your standard peg leg, the obvious torso piece with the hook for a hand (this time in gold) and some fairly unique detailing on the front. Sadly none for the back. And he also has&nbsp;a suitably frightning looking piratical face print with a gritting gapped tooth grimace, a beard and mustache and a brown eye-patch.</p>
<p>He also is carrying a matching golden colored sword and sporting your standard pirate captain's hat with the jolly roger. Seen in 2009's Pirates Theme, only this time in gold to match his accessories. (Did I mention he has a gold tooth?) He also has one of those white feather pieces that doubles as fire when in translucent orange coloring.</p>
<p>Overall I have to say that, while the print and detailing on this one is fairly impressive as is the case with more recent CMFs, he is still easily passable unless you're looking to add a different captain to one of your Pirate vessels. The worst thing about this guy is that the feel method isn't going to help you out very much, I mean unless you're a wiz at detecting that unique hook hand, the shape of the hat or the peg-leg. It really isn't that easy though.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-08-08T14:52:22.3Z","a TYPICAL pirate, but...","<p>The fifteenth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Pirate Captain. He includes 6 pieces, retailed for three dollars, and was released back in 2012. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that pirate&#39;s hat, which was nothing new for the figure. It still looks great, and it&#39;s obviously very fitting. I love the gold skull printed on the front, as well as that white feather quill pegged into the top. It features no printing on the back, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is that face print, which comes out looking fantastic. The big, scraggly beard and moustache really fit, and I love that golden eyepatch. Of course, he has no back facial printing, which is understandable since it&#39;d be completely exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some nice, classic printing that&#39;s clearly very fitting for the figure. The brown belt, the white ruffle at the neck, the red jacket; it all comes together for a great design. Unfortunately, he has no back printing. I do love that hook hand, of course, even though it wasn&#39;t new to the figure or anything. I believe it was new in that gold colour, though.</p>

<p>Finishing off the framework of the figure itself, we have his legs. Of course one of his legs is just plain black with unfortunately no printing, but the other leg is that iconic peg leg, which of course, fits the figure masterfully. Again, it wasn&#39;t new or anything, but it just fits so well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his one accessory, which is just that gold sword. There isn&#39;t anything real special with it, but it is also very fitting. I do kind of wish he included some sort of parrot, though.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, this was a figure that I used to be in love with, as I loved how well executed the pirate aesthetic was. But do I love him just the same, now that I&#39;m a more experienced reviewer? First off, he definitely is the perfect LEGO pirate minifigure. He captures that aesthetic so well, with the eye-0acth, the hook, and even the peg leg. But with that being said, he isn&#39;t the most detailed figure by a long shot, and he doesn&#39;t even include any new moulds.&nbsp;Overall, I&#39;m gonna have to give him a 4 out of 5, because he is a great representation of a pirate; he just isn&#39;t super detailed. That is it for this review,so thanks for reading!</p>
