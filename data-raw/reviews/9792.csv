<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>His sword is awesome!<br></li><li>The detail on the chest plate and legs are very nice.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There is no detail on the body, I'm guessing because he should always have his armor on.<br></li><li>Different colored feathers would have been nice.<br></li></ul>
<p>I definitely feel he was worth the money, even at the TRU price. When you feel the package for him, it's easy to feel for the chest piece. Be careful though because the football player also has a chest piece. You can confirm you have him by feeling for the helmet or the sword. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

","<p>I have a great love of historical Collectible Minifigs, and these charming little representations of slices of humankind's past form my favourite subset of them all. Each wave of Collectible Minifigs seems to have at least one of them, and the Conquistador stands tall as a historical Minifig from Series 8.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There have been some general accusations that Series 8 as a whole feels rather uninspired when compared to its predecessors - or perhaps its just the case that we're suffering from ""Collectible Minifig fatigue"", since this is the <em>third</em> line of Colllectibles that have come out in this year alone (I'm counting the ones from the Olympics, naturally). I kind of feel, though, that there's not much point in judging the merits or pitfalls of a series as a whole, and instead care more about the individual Minifgs themselves. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is, however, indeed true that LEGO did briefly flirt with the idea of conquistadors before in the mid-90s, especially in collaboration with the excellent <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Pirates&amp;subtheme=Islanders"">Islanders</a> sets that were released as a subtheme of the Pirates line at the time. What is therefore disappointing about our Conquistador friend is that none of his moulds are unique, which was, I guess, one major complaint levelled against Series 8 as a whole. I'm not sure if the helmet has been reproduced since the conquistadors went off the shelves in the mid-90s, but the fact remains that every part of this Minifig exists in some other form already.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think an opportunity was missed here to perhaps create a more realistic historical rifle or musket, the kind that might have been seen in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tercio""><em>tercio</em></a> units that would have been common for the time. Maybe it's just a feeling, but it seems to me that LEGO isn't too much in the business of making guns anymore, which is possibly one reason why our Conquistador is armed with only a rapier and nothing else. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the plus side, his armour and legs are nicely printed, though his torso is plain - presumably because the armour is meant to be worn at all times. And I guess his colour scheme is relatively unusual, so he does stand out nicely amongst my historical Minifig collection. If you're a fan of historical Minifigs like I am, getting&nbsp;this representative from the high point of the Spanish Empire and the Age of Exploration is a no-brainer. Others may want to steer clear, unless you're attempting to recreate a LEGO version of <em>Aguirre, Wrath of God</em>.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,1
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-27T12:18:11.05Z","Conquer the Aztec","<p>Set #8833 Conquistador: Series 7 provided an Aztec Warrior for this Mini-Figure to do battle with, now in Series 8 you can build an army of Spanish Invaders.</p>
<p>The Conquistador is a nice looking Mini-Figure, unfortunately there isn't much to look at without the armor on. He has only a solid dark maroon coloured torso, the golden armor piece is where all of the printing is found. And what printing. The grooves and detail work on the armor is fun and impressive, the print on his legs gives us a continuation of the armor covering the upper legs and cuts off with a pantaloon style similar to that found with the Actor, he's wearing gray footwear. (Or rather the feet are not printed revealing the base plastic colour underneath as footwear.)</p>
<p>Re-using the Musqueteer's new rapier piece and bringing a return of the Pirates era Spanish Helmet piece in gold is a welcome sight rounding out the fun of this Mini-Figure. He has a nice facial print with moustache and beard as well as side-burns all in a light brown tone. Overall I'd have to say that, while lacking a lot of printed detail work on the main torso itself this Mini-Figure is well worth having and a perfect companion for the Aztec Warrior. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-05-23T02:50:47.54Z","one of my FAVOURITE FIGURES in the SERIES!","<p>The second figure in the LEGO minifigures Series 8 is the Conquistador. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that helmet, which is caste in pearl gold. The piece itself was nothing new, however it might have been new in that pearl gold colour. I must apologise, as my knowledge of new colours and whatnot in LEGO is awful, but nonetheless, it&#39;s a great colour for it that fits the figure nicely. The curvature on it is great as well, with the smooth sides and the jutting rim around the bottom border. And of course, on top is that large, flowing feather piece caste in bright red, and while that piece isn&#39;t anything special at all, it&#39;s still nice to get, and it&#39;s a good addition to the figure.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which is my older sisters favourite part of the figure, and for good reason, since it is a very well-done head piece. I love the rugged appearance, with the dishevelled hair, and the reddish-brown colouring of it is great, too. I like the pointy tips of his moustache, as well as the thin eyebrows. He has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>Next is the armour piece, and the part itself is nothing new, but the colouring of it is great, being pearl gold. And of course, the printing on it is phenomenal, with the shiny silver detailing around the top by the neck, and even more silver towards the bottom. The black buckles on the bottom are good too, and I love just how rounded the whole thing is, with the smooth front and also the smooth shoulders. No printing on the back of it, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which is nothing too special. It&#39;s just a plain, dark red torso with dark grey hands, and there&#39;s no printing on the front or back of it.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some really amazing detail. I love the gold on the top section of the legs, with the tiny dots on the insides, and the red on the lower legs is actually printed on both the front and sides. Various pearl gold armoury is also printed on the front, which comes out looking pretty fantastic all in all.</p>

<p>And now lastly, we have his sword, which is the Series 4 Musketeer&#39;s sword piece in that same light grey colouring. It looks great, and it&#39;s a very necessary inclusion for the figure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this minifigure! Overall, while this isn&#39;t my top pick, this is probably one of my favourit4ees of the series. It is low on the favourites tier, but nonetheless, he looks pretty great. He&#39;s sort of weird, because much like the Series 7 Evil Knight, I&#39;m perplexed why LEGO chose a &ldquo;Conquistador&rdquo; over just a generic knight, which seemed&nbsp;missing from the world of CMF&#39;s at this time. I do really like this figure, though, especially the dark red and gold colour scheme. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give this character a very high 4 out of 5. So that is all for this review, and thanks for reading!</p>

"aztecwarrior","2020-12-26T21:12:56.73Z","Historic Is Fantastic (HiF)+Time for the Return (TftR) Review: Conquerer of New Lands","<p><a href=""https://Brickset.com/article/55401/series-21-minifigures-revealed!"">Click here to see a new foe to the Conquistador!</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>This is the first HiF+TftR Review</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spaniards&nbsp;</strong>have arrived! Shouts&nbsp;and cries arise from the Aztecs as the far away foreigners arrive in their tall masted galleons to the shores of Mexico. The Conquistador is a very fine minifigure, the 2nd minifigure in the cmf Series 8.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Minifigure closely represents older minifigures of&nbsp;the Spanish Armada subtheme of the large Pirates theme. This is an explorer and soldier both. Armored with a shinning chest plate of gold with incredibly intricate designs, heavy iron boots to keep him rooted to the ground in battle, and a golden helm of Spanish origin topped with a flowing bright red feather from a tropical bird in the carribean, this minifigure is more like a Spanish Commander than a soldier. (he would be if he had dull armored companions that looked less impresdive that he could command). While his clothes underneath is a&nbsp;plain dark red color and not very impressive, it would be a lot more weight on his body if he had more armor underneath the massive gold plate. (He might lose more battles than he wins ones with any extra weight!).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Conquistadors face is a friendly smile with wide eyes, but ready for adventures in the exotic lands of South and Central America. He has a large beard showing he is of older age, and a fine and thick mustache, common of most Spaniards.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His only weapon is a rapier which is light and nimble and can be thrust through the smallest gaps in any armour. It is the only weapon this minifigure needs for he is wise in the ways of battle tactics and can easily outsmart most foes.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While I am reviewing a minifigure that is about 7 or 8 years old, it is still one that stands out the most, especially in series 8. I think lego did mostly a fine job on this minifigure harkening back to the old Spanish Armada subtheme whos last set was in 2002 (I think). It also represents a piece of history that was a major turning point in events of the world, and lego should make many more historical minifigures like the Aztec Warrior and Jungle Boy from series 7 that fit in the same time era and theme as the Conquistador... Historic is Fantastic!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Note: After about 8 years of owning this minifigure the armour piece has split in two. That was because I was to rough with it and left in the open where I could easily step on it. So, if you decide to buy this minifigure, then, to avoid having the chest plate break, you should try to leave it on the minifigure or at least any minifigure torso so it doesn&#39;t snap!)</p>
