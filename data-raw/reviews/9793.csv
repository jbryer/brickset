<p>This being my first exposure to the Robot's parts I don't think this is a bad Mini-Fig, or a wasted slot in Series 8. In fact I'm extremely glad I managed to get this one, he's got an excellent level of detailing in his print. (Which is single-sided unfortuantely.) The chest shows his power core, several technical bits of detailing and a bit of lower body plating or armor to protect the vital components of the robot. His legs feature more robotic printing and his face. The print on his face looks like something out of classic sci-fi, possibly even Star Wars, he's got dangerous looking glowing red eyes and a mouth vocoder for speaking.</p>
<p>The hat or robot head is a great looking piece, suitable for some Sci-Fi Classics era MOCs, two radio control antennea for the robot and a bunch of rivets and details to make it look like its built out of more than one piece of metal. Also this Mini-Fig is all black with some red detailing, cliche perhaps, but definitely impressive looking. He also has one arm with a claw on the end of it. Plus the standard space gun introduced in the&nbsp;Collectible Mini-Figures series with a red lightsaber beam for the blast of energy.</p>
<p>Overall I'm extremely impressed by this Mini-Figure and think that he'd be a great addition for Classic Space displays, or even joining the cast of the Alien Conquest Theme as some new menace the ADU must deal with. Great job LEGO.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"8BrickMario","2015-10-07T17:35:33.203Z","PRE-PARE TO BE DE-STROYED!","<p>Serving as an evil counterpart to the Series 1 Robot, the Evil Robot was someone who had to join my collection. While he&#39;s not explicitly a Halloween monster, I consider him to be, given his 1950s&nbsp;horror sci-fi influence.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for Series 8 is a black color, which fits a few of its characters, but makes Santa and the Fairy look rather out of place. The checklist shows off the figures quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this figure are rather useful for any evil humanoid with armor or robotic parts. The ever-popular ray gun makes a return in dark metallic grey.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This guy is pretty cool! He reuses the retro-stye&nbsp;bucket helmet, which manages to be threatening and comically outdated at the same time. Under his helmet, his face consists of a metal plate that has no lower jaw. section. The plate has some &quot;teeth&quot; that come down, and there are some nice details showing where the metal has been fused and screwed together. His torso has <em>lots</em> of detail, with a red core in the center, and some apparent joints at the waist. His right arm is a robot arm in black, with a dark grey robot claw in the end. This piece is a lot of fun, because anything with a bar end can be used in the robot arm. His legs continue the detailed machinery printing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great minifigure. He&#39;s a fun counterpart to the Series 1 Robot, and he makes for a really good evil character. He&#39;s ridiculously detailed, too, so I would definitely suggest you search for him!</p>

"sideswinger","2021-05-21T22:57:53.28Z","bad choice=bad FIGURE!","<p>The first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Evil Robot. This figure was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that bucket-head helmet caste in an extremely dark gun-metal grey, which was a new colour that was new to the figure. Of course this figure is an evil reincarnation of the Series 1 Robot figure, and the helmet piece was new to that figure, so I like how this Evil Robot remains faithful to the original. Of course, the colour of the helmet is different, but the entire colour&nbsp;scheme itself is different as well, which differentiates it nicely. Anyway, the helmet itself features some nice, robotic moulded detail, with the antennae on the sides, and even the individual bolts sticking out.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which has some good printing. I like the red eyes, and the shiny silver printing surrounding them&nbsp;looks good as well. It looks slightly similar to the Series 1 Robot, which is, of course, accurate to the character.</p>

<p>Next is the torso and arms, which is where things get pretty interesting. The printing on the front of the torso is really complex, and it actually does look pretty fantastic, with the big red circle in the centre, and all the technical-looking ires and whatnot. But as always, LEGO completely omitted back torso printing, which is a major issue I have. The arms are interesting, though, one of which is a normal minifigure arm that has no printing and a nice red hand, while the other arm is that classic robot arm that was introduced in the Series 1 Robot. Of course here, it&#39;s in a nice new black colour, and the moulding on it is good, even though it isn&#39;t anything super amazing. Of course that claw is a separate piece, and it comes together for a nice arm that remains faithful to the original Series 1 Robot.</p>

<p>His legs feature some more really complex robotic detail, like the shiny silver wires, and the tiny bolts, and even the bits of red mingled into the thighs. Another nice, small touch is the silver lining on his waist.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, and it&#39;s just a ray gun. I like the inclusion of an accessory, especially since the original figure didn&#39;t include one. But let&#39;s be honest, even though it may be fitting, it&#39;s a terrible accessory just because of how horribly it&#39;s overused in the world of CMF&#39;s. I actually counted how many times a ray gun was used, and between Series&#39; 1-8, there&#39;s been 6 cases of it. That just shows how lazy LEGO can be sometimes! But anyway, the colour of the gun itself is a dark grey, which isn&#39;t anything real special, and the pole attached to it is a translucent-red colour, which is equally unimportant.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all for this figure! Overall, I love how faithful it is to the original Series 1 Robot, and I like the concept of an evil variant of it, but it&#39;s a bit of a bad choice, Robot&#39;s in CMF&#39;s have appeared an abundant amount of times, even between Series 1 and 8, and this Evil Robot figure has to be one of the worst for me. His parts have good printing and all, but again, he just feels like a bad choice, and the design of him isn&#39;t enough to save the figure for me, unfortunately. And it doesn&#39;t help that he was one of the most common in the series, which made him severely unwanted even to this day. In the end, I am gonna give this figure a 2 out of 5. That wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
