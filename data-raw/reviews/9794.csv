She comes with nine pieces: Dress, Torso, the 3-part alien head/brain, gun, stud trans piece, and a cape in two parts. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Torso and Dress: Both are printed on the&nbsp;front with a nice purple and black stripe which contours will with the pink/purple theme of the figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Head: If you are familiar with the&nbsp;commander or android from Alien Conquest, you will be familar with the three part head piece (lower jaw and eyes, regular head, upon which is placed the brain). This is a nice pink (fushia?) variation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Cape: This cape is new to me. Intead of the more complex one-piece cape donned by the vampire in Series 2, she sports a cape in two pieces, one regular cape and a small cape which is put on upside-down for the collar portion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playability: It depends on if you like Space and Sci-Fi LEGO sets. If you do, then this is a dramatic and fun addition to those playsets. My boys are into these, so they are enjoying another leader for the ADU to capture. I like the idea that LEGO will use this series to do some supplementing to its various series, and I hope they will do a little more of this each series (not too much, mind you).</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-10-31T21:26:07.96Z","Illegal alien. ","Basic syllogistic logic says that I can make the following true statement: either you have the Alien Overlord from Alien Conquest; in particular, from the one from Alien Mothership (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7065-1"">7065</a>), or you do not. If you are in the former category, I suspect that there is little reason for you to desire our dear Alien Villainess - in fact, you might feel slightly offended by a sense that the exclusivity of owning the Alien Overlord has been somewhat impinged upon.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But this review is aimed squarely at people who fall into the latter category - that is, people who do not have the Alien Overlord in their possession through one means or another - because I am in such a category.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, our Alien Villainess is one very impressive Minifig, and probably among the most finicky Minifigs to put together in the history of Minifig-dom. Her purple cape comes in two separate pieces, and her ""face"" is not actually her head but a piece of neckwear, if you can believe it, that is secured by a pink Minifig head to which the ""brain"" piece connects from the top. It's all quite elaborate, and it makes for a spectacular-looking Minifig with tons of great details to soak in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It goes without saying that our Alien Villainess blends in perfectly with the rest of the Alien Conquest aliens, one of the few CMFs that seems to have been designed with an existing subtheme squarely in mind (albeit an all-but-obsolete one). Her pink-and-black attire matches exactly that of the various alien troopers terrorising your town, along with a matching stripe motif that her underlings sport as well. The sharp-eyed may also notice that her ""belt"" has an amusing insignia of a simple UFO icon, complete with abduction rays emanating from the bottom.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I personally have just two Alien Conquest sets - the Tripod Invader (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7051-1"">7051</a>) and the battle pack (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=853301-1"">853301</a>), both of which I managed to get for cheap - and these seemed like more than good enough as a starting point for an alien invasion, with the Alien Villainness leading the way. Basically, what I'm saying is that it won't take much investment if you fancy playing at staging an extraterrestrial invasion of your city.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If the growing pantheon of space heroes and villains catches your fancy, you won't be disappointed by one of the most detailed Collectible Minifigs in existence - that is, unless you already own the aforementioned Alien Overlord from Alien Conquest, in which case you are likely to feel gipped. Then again, every overlord needs a queen, does he not?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,2
"Odeinoichus","2012-11-14T19:23:27.03Z","You're a Girl?","<p>Set #8833 Alien Villainess: My fellow LEGO enthusiasts, behold a rare sight indeed. Through out the history of LEGO we have seen very few female Mini-Figs of standard design and type, most often we find them in Licensed or City Themes, a rare site is it indeed to witness one in a different Theme.</p>
<p>To date there are a grand total of three female Aliens in LEGO form. The first, if memory serves, was part of the Insectoids Theme, there the Insectoids were ruled over by a very rare Mini-Fig to find for collectors in this day and age, the Insectoid Queen. The second is one of the Mini-Figs found in LEGO's Life on Mars Theme, if memory serves one of those Battle Droid inspired aliens was meant to be a female character. And this offering from Series 8 is our third, to date, Female Alien in Mini-Figure form.</p>
<p>Her overall look and design sort of reminds me of Emperor... Forgive me... Evil Emperor Zurg from Toy Story. Not the toy design, but the character design seen in Disney's Buzz Lightyear cartoon. She's got a dark black sloped brick with dress printing in black and very rich looking royal purple. Her single sided torso print carries these colors over into the print, adding a small golden colored belt just a bit above the waist line. (Or where the brick meets torso.) And she has a 50's era Sci-Fi neck thing, not a necklace, but something else in her print that kind of looks like something Darth Vader might wear for breathing.</p>
<p>Her accessories include two pieces for a royal purple cape, and a silver styled blaster with purple 1x1 stud for the energy emitting barrel. The head is built up out of three pieces, a green alien head found in the Alien Conquest Theme, a standard Mini-Figure head piece all in pink to hold the head in place, and a unique Alien Conquest brain piece. There's even printed on eyelashes and possibly alien lipstick.</p>
<p>Overall she's just gorgeous, technically speaking, the design is awesome. It evokes a classic 50's era sci-fi villainess and for Female Mini-Fig enthusiasts it is a boon, as it gives you the easiest way to get a girl alien outside of secondary market purchasing sites like Bricklink. Easy to find via the feel method due to her sloped brick piece, and comes highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2021-08-15T03:03:43.813Z","one of my LEAST FAVOURITES, but...","<p>The sixteenth and final minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Alien Villainess. She includes 9 pieces, was released in 2012, and retailed for three dollars. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have a head piece that&#39;s made up of three pieces: the brain, the face, and the head piece inside. The head inside is just a classic LEGO Minifigure head without printing, but it is caste in a hot pink colour, which actually isn&#39;t the most common colour for the piece. The face is the same piece used for the Alien Conquest theme, but it does include some exclusive printing here. I personally really love her big black eyes and her angry scowl. That translucent, pink brain on top was&nbsp;not a new mould, as it was also introduced in Alien Conquest.Howver it is in a new colour here. I really like the moulding it sports, and it fits the figure pretty well.</p>

<p>Next we have her cape, which is made up of two pieces. They both have a great purple colour, and they make&nbsp;great touches&nbsp;for the figure! Of course, they are not the newer styling released in 2016; it is just that harder material, which isn&#39;t bad whatsoever.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which isn&#39;t really the most complex torso design, and it looks a lot like something from Alien Conquest. I do like the belt design, and the hot pink arms are great touches as well.</p>

<p>Next is her dress, which sports some good printing. Of&nbsp;course, it is that older styling, with the flat slope at the back, and the two studs on top. The newer style&nbsp;was released in 2018, and this was back in 2012.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her ray gun, which is a very boring accessory. Even in 2012, the choice of including ray guns in CMF&#39;s was a very overused trope, and unfortunately,&nbsp;that habit continued, even after this series. The ray gun included here isn&#39;t caste in an exclusive colour, or anything special like that, which is kind of a missed opportunity. It should have been caste in maybe a hotlink colour, or even plain black. A 1x1 stud is included to attach to the front of the gun, but overall, it&#39;s such a boring accessory.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, before I give my opinion on her, I just wanna say, this minifigure was supposed to be included in an Alien Conquest set, and ultimately, the set she was included in got cancelled. I suppose LEGO wanted to use their design somewhere, so hay just plunked her into a minifigure series. And I haver to say, she isn&#39;t my favourite in the series. Is she my least favourite? I don&#39;t think she is, but still, she isn&#39;t super amazing. Especially considering her awfully boring accessory. Overall, I&#39;m gonna have to give her a 2. But that is it for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
