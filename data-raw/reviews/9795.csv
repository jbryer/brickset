"Odeinoichus","2012-12-25T12:05:31.65Z","The Adventures of...","<p>Set #8833 Diver: Series 8 is either the best offering or the worst offering of Mini-Figs, it all depends on how you feel about alien queens, pirate captains and re-used parts we've all seen before. Or have we?</p>
<p>Enter the Diver, Series 1 introduced us to the CMF craze with a figure called the Deep Sea Diver, since then we haven't really seen any underwater themed Mini-Figs until Series 7's Ocean King and now the Diver. I have to admit the Diver is a bit of a weaker offering from LEGO as far as excitement goes, but a welcome offering from LEGO as far as parts, prints and diverse Mini-Figures goes.</p>
<p>The torso and legs are made up of a color we don't often see for Mini-Figures, primarily a very light brown with some minor gray for the belt/waist area and gloves. He has a double-sided print for the torso featuring all of the authentic design elements one would see on classic looking diving suits from the early 20th century. There's a belt that straps down over both shoulders in a cross patern, pouches where weights would be kept to allow for diving, the air-tight seals around the neckline to prevent drowning and the print carries down into the legs via the middle support belt. He also has knee-pads or something similar and a bit of printing on the front of the feet. Quite impressive level of detail and authenticity.</p>
<p>The helmet piece is all new, with molded detail work on the sides, and a clear viewing facemask in front. I love all the little authentic detail work, there are rivets where the pieces were put together and the classic vents on the side. The glass faceplate even looks like it is enlarging the Mini-Figures face visually, while I doubt very much that it actually does magnify. It is a solid piece.</p>
<p>His accessories, saddly, are a bit less than impressive. While it is true a diver of that era might bring a harpoon weapon to protect themselves from unseen threats, the fact that two 1x1 tiles are used to simulate lead weights on the feet, while authentic, and in nice medium gray coloring to match the gloves and belt, are a bit on the weak side. If anything it would have been nice to see him holding a camera to document his finds, I mean he's got this open mouthed expression of awe and wonder on his face, so he's going to shoot whatever he's found lethally instead of capturing it for posterity?</p>
<p>Overall I think this does a fine job of capturing a historical character, most LEGO City displays of a modern type wouldn't use this Mini-Fig, and Atlantis or similar underwater themed sets wouldn't need him because he's quite out of his element. That being said, from a purely historical standpoint he's a great&nbsp;addition to the uniqueness that is LEGO's CMF Series. For a kid he might not be the best, unless you remind them of that certain episode from Scooby-Doo, his colors aren't right, but he'd make an excellent Ghost of Captain Cutler, or perhaps Tintin is exploring in search of Red Rackham's Treasure with Captain Haddock. All it's missing is an easily MOCable bellows for the air supply, as these types of Diver suits were not meant to have self contained air supplies. All-in-all a great Mini-Figure who, more than likely won't see much love from children, but AFOLs and History Buffs/MOCers are going to love it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

"sideswinger","2021-05-27T23:03:34.597Z","a SOLID REMAKE!","<p>The sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Diver. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that diver&#39;s helmet, which is a fantastic piece that was very new to the figure. It is caste in pearl gold as always, and I love how round it is, with only the vents and the stud disrupting the smoothness of it all. I like how it covers the top of the torso, making it appear air-tight. In the middle there, we have the large, glass window that seems to magnify the figure&#39;s face print. It uses the same size for a window that&#39;s used with the common magnifying glass accessory, so I suppose that&#39;s nice part usage. Of course, it is very accurate to a real diver&#39;s helmet as well.</p>

<p>Underneath that helmet, and peaking through the window on front is the face print. I really like how gleeful he looks, and the open-mouthed expression fits. He has no alternate expression, in case you were wondering. I think it would have been better to have included a scared expression, but this is a nice compromise.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which is great! The colour-difference between this and the helmet is a bit distracting, especially since it&#39;s such a slight colour difference, it seems accidental. But aside from that, I do really love the printing on it, with that belt, those straps, and also the collar design. Shockingly enough, this figure also has back torso printing, which is incredible!</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some fine detail on the piece between his legs, to where that brown strap carries on from the torso. I also love the brown knee pads. Of course, he also has some appealing shoe details, which was a pretty rare find back in the day. It would&#39;ve been great if he had side shoe-printing, but it&#39;s okay, because...</p>

<p>...he includes boots as well, which are cleverly replicated using 1x1 plates connected to the bottom of his legs! I do like the inclusion of &ldquo;boots,&rdquo; and how LEGO even took the time to include them at all, as they were absolutely unnecessary for the figure; I don&#39;t really think they were replicated all too well, as they don&#39;t even align expertly with the shoes printed on the legs at all. Also, since the shoes aren&#39;t printed on the sides of his legs, they appear to be plugged on their by a typical &quot;noob&quot; in LEGO. But the good news is, I don&#39;t have anything to complain about because the figure can easily be displayed without them. Still, it&#39;s such a weird inclusion!</p>

<p>Lastly, we have that...um... unfortunately, I&#39;m unfamiliar with the proper name for it, and will presume by calling it his &ldquo;gun,&rdquo; because why not? I do like the inclusion of that diver&#39;s &ldquo;gun.&rdquo; The image here on Brickset depicts it to be a shiny silver colour, but in reality, it&#39;s just a normal grey colour, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>That is all for this figure! Before I go into my final opinion of him, I wanna clarify something: this is basically a remake of the Deep Sea Diver from Series 1, which had a much more generic diver appearance, reused old parts, and looked a whole lot like something generic out of LEGO City, so this Series 8 Diver is basically a remake. And as I strongly dislike the Series 1 Deep Sea Diver figure, this is an amazing remake, and looks fantastic. He ties with a couple others for my favourite of the series, as he has such great pieces, such great printing, and a decent value for 3 dollars. That was my final verdict, and this is the end of this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
