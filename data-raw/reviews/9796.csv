Series two gave us Lego's second Vampire minifig, which was very awesome. The collectable minifig vampire is my favorite Lego minifig. So much that i used the head for my sigfig. Now Lego has given us a vampire bat creature similar to the Monster Fighters bat creatures. These ones are black, and I think they look slightly better.&nbsp;</p><p>The arms on this minifigure are completely different than the regular minifigs. The ears are pretty neat, and the hair is very similar to the hair piece on the CM elves and werewolves. the head is not extremely versatile, but it looks pretty neat.&nbsp;</p><p>I am using these bat creatures with my group of vampire minifigs (most have swords). They have made in the CM line a Vampire, a Werewolf, Frankenstein's monster, a zombie, and a mummy, and now a Bat creature. I'm hoping for more monster collectable minifigs and monster fighters sets. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I think this is a pretty great set, and I liked it enough that I felt the bags, and got 3. This is my favorite of series 8, and I give it a pretty great rating.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,4

I am very happy that they have made him into Vampire Bat so that I wouldn't have to spend so much on Man Bat. I'm big into fantasy and think these guys make a good army builder to fight my dwarves.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The detail of the body is nice and matches well with his face.<br></li><li>He's cheaper than Man Bat<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I wish he had detail on the legs, like furry knee caps or something than just plain old black<br></li></ul>
<p>The way I found him was to look for the upper body and feel for the arms. You will definitely be able to tell if its him or not. <br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T19:57:01.247Z","Blood Sucker?","<p><strong>Set #8833 Vampire Bat: </strong>It&#39;s close to Halloween and since it is let&#39;s review this latecomer to my collection from Series 8.</p>

<p>The Vampire Bat introduced a brand new hair/head piece with large bat ears and a widow&#39;s peak hair/fur covering. With plain black legs, a decent looking single sided torso print of a furry muscle filled chest and a single sided facial print showing off a fan filled maw with haunting red eyes and a tiny little bat nose.</p>

<p>He had no accessories, quite frankly I found this minifigure just a little bit weaker compared to others, I am not a fan of the new arms with the wings attached. Mostly because it limits the poses he can hold. Overall, while I myself am not much of a fan, this is one of the more popular figures because of its ties to the Halloween Theme and allows for some great options for a seasonal display. I recommend it for that reason alone despite my personal opinion of the torso.</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-10-08T18:21:12.963Z","Bat monsters reVAMPed!","<p>Because this one was a monster, I needed to get him. However, I wasn&#39;t sure if he was a great figure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The black packaging of Series 8 was a bit surprising considering the light colors previous, but it looks fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this figure are pretty good for what it is, but they can&#39;t be used for much else. The wings would make a good glide suit for Batman, though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Vampire Bat is basically a black version of the Monster Fighters Bat Monsters. His hairpiece is the same, but in black with grey ear printing.&nbsp;This one has a nice face, with the triangular bat nose and some red eyes. His mouth is open, revealing his fangs. This face is much more realistically batlike than his predecessors&#39;, so that&#39;s a plus. His body is the only other place with printing, showing a furry muscled chest. The bat wings are a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. They look very nice and dramatic, but the potential poses are far fewer than those possible with traditional arms, and the wings only look good posed like the image above, anyway. The rest of the design is very plain, as there is no decoration.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this one enough, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a very strong figure. I don&#39;t think it was a necessary or useful retread, and there&#39;s not much detail, either. If you want him and can find him, get him, but if you&#39;re not into the figure, you&#39;d be fine to skip it.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-06-11T18:16:22.523Z","GOOD, but not my favourite!","<p>The eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Vampire Bat. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair-ear combo, which was not a new element, but it was new in that colouring. It was originally used for the Man-Bat in Monster Fighters, so it&#39;s nice seeing it in a new colour, as well as a much cheaper way to get it. I like the smooth hair moulded on top, as well as the kinky detail at the back. And of course, those pointy ears look fantastic, especially with the grey fur printing inside them.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is appropriately creepy. I really appreciate the big red eyes, with the small white pupils, and those white fangs are creepy, too. The grey fur behind it all is very nice as well. No alternate expression or anything.</p>

<p>Next is the arms and torso, and the torso has more fantastic grey fur printing, with that furry six-pack. It is sad that he has no back printing, but I do love those arms. Believe it or not, those wing-arms weren&#39;t new, and they, like the hair piece, were originally made for the Man-Bat from Monster Fighters, but they, too, are in a new black colouring here; this is also a much cheaper alternative to that Man-Bat. I love the inclusion of them here, and they fit the figure amazingly, especially in that black colouring.</p>

<p>And since the legs unfortunately lack printing, and since he has no accessory, it&#39;s time to discuss the final verdict. Overall, I do think that the concept of having a Vampire Bat in a minifigure series is very fresh and original, and I like how he has the new black pieces. Another good thing is that the original Man-Bat figure was pretty pricey to get, so this was a great alternative for 3 dollars. I also think it&#39;s better than the original. But in the end, he isn&#39;t necessarily my favourite in the series. So even though he is pretty good, I&#39;m only gonna give him a 4 instead of a 5. Either way, that&#39;s it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
