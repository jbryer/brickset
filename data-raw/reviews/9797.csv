 Pros</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Looks great and /or cute</li>
 <li>
  If your the parent of a young girl giving her this will score you HUGE points.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Cons</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The skirt is a little fiddly to apply even for an adult but it is made of a durable material so shouldn&#39;t rip.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Girls will love this minifig, boys maybe not but I suspect it will be one of the harder ones to collect. We felt very lucky that we got hold of it easily.</p>

In Lego Form!","<p>I got this set a couple of weeks ago at my local Target, and hadn't found time to do a review, so I've decided to do it right now. I got this fairy along with the series 8 DJ for regular price. I opened it, and was rather surprised at the fact that Lego would ever make a fairy. However, this is an excellent rendition of the mythical being.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>This feels very Disney-ey to me; like an original Lego version of Tinker Bell.&nbsp;</li><li>The colors on here are outstanding; they are bright greens and blues, transparent in the case of the wings, and the pink wand is relatively cool.&nbsp;</li><li>The overall appearance is just cool; the addition of the wings and wand just make the whole thing work.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I do feel that the wand is too poppy; it just doesn't work with the rest of the accessories or clothing, in my opinion.&nbsp;</li><li>I also feel that the skirt is ridiculously difficult to put on; it looks great when you put it on, but it's too much of a hassle to make it perfect.&nbsp;</li><li>I feel that the head and hair don't feel all that fairy-ey to me; it feels sort of normal once the face smear is taken off.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>The fairy is a nice addition to the minifigure collection; it's the first female figure that's actually cool and unique, and the fairy has that Disney quality. However, the set has difficulties when applying and it feels a bit too human. I recommend it to those who are into Castle or Fantasy sets; maybe even for Zelda MOCs.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-02T21:20:26.86Z","I do believe in Fairies.","<p>Set #8833 Fairy: This is just a beautiful Mini-Figure, seriously she's got to be one of the best new ideas from LEGO in the CMF series for Female Mini-Figs. And so obvious.</p>
<p>The Fairy is dressed in a blue top with a flower pin on her top, already I can envision this Torso print being used in MOCs for Prom or Wedding/Bridal Parties. She also has a great new wing piece in transparent blue, although is it truly new? We haven't seen it before in Bellville have we? No I don't think so. I'm hoping to see way more colors for this piece in new sets, perhaps with the Disney license we'll see some Disney Fairies sets in the future.</p>
<p>She's carrying a wizard's wand in transparent pink, and using the same hairpiece as the flamenco dancer. And of course there's the waist cloth piece for a skirt. A bit of a tricky piece to get on correctly, children may require assistance when putting it on. Overall I'd have to say getting the Fairy Mini-Figure from Series 8 is definitely one you can't pass up, especially for great MOC Potentials.</p>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2021-05-31T17:05:05.513Z","simply, GREAT!","<p>The ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Fairy. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that Series 4 Ice Skater hair in a fantastic nougat colouring, which appears to be new for the figure in that colouring. I love the wavy moulding on the front, and that bun in the back of the hair looks great as well. I do like the choice of using that hair piece, since it fits the&nbsp;&ldquo;fairy&rdquo; trope to me.</p>

<p>Next is her head piece, which has some nice printing. I like the pink lipstick, and of course, that little flower detailing adds a lot to the figure for me. She has no alternate expression, which is okay.</p>

<p>Next is her wings, and I deeply apologise, but my knowledge on if that piece was new or not isn&#39;t&nbsp;present. I simply have no idea! But they look gorgeous on her, especially in that translucent light-blue colouring. I love a lot of things about that piece: I like how theirs two segments; one larger part and a smaller part, both of which are split down the centre. And fairy wings are absolutely necessary for her, so they&#39;re used very appropriately here.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which also sports some good printing. I love the leafy-texture printing on the light blue part, and how they resemble straps; and that large, pink flower on the upper-right corner is also a great addition. She has no back printing, but thankfully, the torso is caste in light blue which is accurate to the front torso.</p>

<p>Next is her skirt piece. Here on Brickset, I&#39;ve seen some reviews that complain about it being pretty finicky to attach on her legs. I don&#39;t own this figure, but I can understand how annoying it could be. However, it looks splendid on her, especially with its spring green colouring that contrasts well with the rest of the figure. I also really love the pointy bottoms it has.</p>

<p>Next are her legs, which actually have some light blue printing on the top, underneath that skirt. It&#39;s hard to see, but it is indeed there.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her wand. Once again, unfortunately, my knowledge on if it was new or not is non-existent. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a great piece, especially in that translucent pink colouring. I love how that piece has the star on top as well; it&#39;s just a fantastic accessory.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I do really love the concept, as it presents a very fresh idea in the world of CMF. She also has some nice, useful pieces that I have to appreciate. But actually, this figure is great just because of how well-done she is in general, with the great hair, head, wings...well, everything about her is great! So overall, I will give her a 5 out of 5 rating. That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
