"Odeinoichus","2013-02-27T12:28:17.243Z","Plain, but Fun","<p>Set #8833 Football Player: Or as most of the world knows it American Football, this Mini-Figure is a welcome addition to Sports Themed Mini-Figures and yet suffers a few minor problems.</p>
<p>First off all the printing on the main Mini-Figure itself is very sparse, the only printing found anywhere on him is the kneepads on his legs, the rest of the Mini-Figure is plain white with no markings. The new shoulder piece giving him the appearance of a Football Player is where all the printing can be found, representing his jersey, number twelve. The print work, while sparse, is exceptionally well detailed and captures what a person playing the game professionally would wear.</p>
<p>There is even an impressive determined looking facial print complete with the black markings worn under the eyes of most professional sportsmen. This Mini-Figure also introduces two new pieces to make up the Football helmet, a smooth open-ended helmet piece and the white wireframe protective piece&nbsp;found on all Football helmets. It's really great,&nbsp;however as I look at it I come to realize this is not new to the CMF series, merely new to my collection. I've forgotten that these parts were also included with the Hockey Player in Series 4 which I, sadly, missed out on.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this Mini-Figure is definitely worth tracking down to build up a small Football Team, sure they'd all have the same number on their jersey, but it's a tiny price to pay. Of note, while the new trophy piece is quite welcome here the fact that he does not include an actual Football does knock him down a peg in the ratings department. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing LEGO re-introduce a small Sports Theme of Sets featuring actual Footballs and different Jersey numbers to go with this guy. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-05-27T00:48:03.83Z","great design, but he's MISSING something...","<p>The fifth figure in the Minifigures Series 8 is the Football Player. He was released in 2012, retailed for three bucks, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that helmet and visor, both of which are crucial to the figure, and both of which look great. I like seeing the helmet itself in plain blue, though it isn&#39;t anything new or exclusive at all. And even though it too is an old piece, that visor is also great, and is perhaps the most important part of the figure. Again, it wasn&#39;t new or anything, but that&#39;s just fine.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has a great expression, with that stubborn look. I like the little details as well, like the cheekbones and the small creases around the eyes.&nbsp; Something I really love is those lines under his eyes. I know nothing about football, so I&#39;m gonna call them &ldquo;lines under his eyes!&rdquo; but jokes aside, they look awesome and are nice details as well. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>I suppose the next thing to talk about is that breastplate, or armour, or... again, I legit know nothing about football, so I haven&#39;t the faintest idea what it&#39;s called! It has some good printing in general, to where we have those lines around the collar section. I really don&#39;t understand the significance of choosing the number 12 as his team number, but I suppose it&#39;s just a random pick. It would&#39;ve been clever to have done the number 8 to coincide with Series 8, which is, of course, the series this figure is included in. I like how rounded the shoulder-pads are, and I&#39;m impressed how he has back printing, with another 12 and some more dark blue lines.</p>

<p>I suppose next would be his torso, which is plain white with absolutely no printing. That&#39;s fine with me, as it wouldn&#39;t be seen with that armour on anyway. It is rather interesting how the arms are plain yellow, I suppose.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which only feature slight printing on those knees, representing the knee pads.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his one accessory, which is a trophy. Nothing special with the trophy, as it is an old piece. I suppose it fits the figure, and the pearl gold colour is good as well; however, this is a football player, so I would come to expect that a football would be included. But I am wrong! No football whatsoever is included, which is really sad, if you ask me. I wish LEGO would have introduced a new football piece with the figure, especially since this figure has no new pieces. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the trophy is really great; I just wish he had a football.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I really like everything about this figure, and it just represents a typical football player, which is something I really like. But my only problem with him is the lack of a football, which is a crucial thing to include in a &ldquo;football player.&rdquo; figure. So in the end, while I do really love the design, I&#39;m only gonna give him a 3. I would have given him a 4 if he had a football, but the lack of such a crucial thing brings him down to 3 for me. I suppose the value is decent, being 3 dollars. But all in all, I guess that wraps up this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
