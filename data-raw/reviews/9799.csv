"Odeinoichus","2013-02-27T13:00:34.63Z","Doing Business Downtown","<p>Set #8833 Businessman: Some might think this is a bland offering from LEGO as there aren't very many unique new parts or printing with this Mini-Figure, I'd have to say those people are wrong.</p>
<p>The Businessman is a single-sided print Mini-Fig, his torso has a suitjacket on, complete with striped white undershirt and, of all things, a purple tie. The legs have no printing, the back has no printing and the facial print is single-sided only as well, with a pair of glasses and a great little moustache. Still he's a wonderfully welcome addition to the LEGO Collectible Mini-Figures line.</p>
<p>His accessories include a plain brown suitcase, similar piece found in many LEGO City sets, a 2x2 tile with newspaper print. (The financial section of the paper.) And he's wearing a bowler hat, that alone is enough to want to pick him up. This new hat piece is fun looking and great for MOCing some new Mini-Figures with Bowler hats, Charlie Chaplain, Dr. Watson to go with Series 5's Detective (AKA Sherlock Holmes) and any number of other custom Mini-Figures. Overall while the Businessman doesn't have much printing, what's here is very welcome indeed and I strongly recommend grabbing a few up for the bowler hat alone.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2021-05-29T16:11:26.64Z","the PERFECT businessman!","<p>The eighth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Businessman. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that bowler hat that was new for the figure back in the day. It&#39;s simply a fantastic piece; I love how round it is, with the super smooth top, as well as the indention down by the rim. The surrounding rim is super great as well, and it&#39;s an extremely fitting business-esque hat that fits the figure nicely.</p>

<p>Next is his head, which has a fantastic expression. He sports some thin, black glasses and some brown eyebrows above them. Of course, that small but effective moustache is a very welcome part of his face, and I just love that down-to-business frown he has. He has no back facial printing, which is good since it&#39;d be severely exposed due to that hat piece.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which isn&#39;t anything too special; it&#39;s basically just a generic suit. I like that, though, as it fits the figure nicely. Of course that purple tie inside the black jacket is good, and he even has a bit of a white undershirt showing through as well. He has no back printing, though.</p>

<p>And his legs are just plain black with no printing, so let&#39;s move on to his accessories. The first accessory is that brown suitcase. It isn&#39;t anything new or exclusive, but it&#39;s extremely fitting, and I like how he has two accessories, anyway. That 2x2 newspaper, though, is amazing. It&#39;s so highly detailed, with the &ldquo;city financial news&rdquo; in that nice font, and I like that graph on it as well. The thing I like about it is that it wasn&#39;t even that necessary, and the fact that LEGO included it at all is fantastic.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, this is not only a fantastic, fresh idea, but it&#39;s executed so well, with that new bowler hat, and even that 2x2 print. I like the little things about him as well, like the head, torso, and suitcase. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 5, just because of how excellent the execution is. That&#39;s it for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
