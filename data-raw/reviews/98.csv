The box continues with the Original Trilogy Edition packaging and hinged opening. As you would expect from a UCS set it is highly detailed and true to the prototype with all the pipe and cable runs on the outside. It looks very accurate compared to the movies, and as anyone who reads my reviews will know I do like accuracy – within the limits of the medium. 

Construction is basically modular with the engines fuselage, wings and cockpit all made as sub-assemblies and clicking together. There are stickers for cockpit framing and other minor markings – again printed would have been preferred, but could probably not be justified for such a limited use – although it could have been used on 7262 which includes the recently released smaller Y – Wing. The review below could be about that set - as there is no TIE advanced in this set - just the excellent Y – Wing!

Engines are quite delicate due to their support pylons, which are made by combining several small sections of ridged tubing over a central axel core to act as a stiffener. This is a little tedious - why they couldn’t use a longer white tube like the engines on the Falcon (4504) I don’t know. The pylons on the front of the engine nacelles use white battle droid bodies as part of their ingenious construction!

You do get an R2 unit, but like with the UCS X – Wing no pilot – presumably because it is not considered minifig scale. However, it is not that far out and I will consider using the Y – Wing pilot from 7262 to augment this otherwise superb sculpture. UCS stand and “card” complete this set which gets a 10 from me and is a must have for any self respecting SW Lego fan.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T16:03:49Z","great, but not the best..","when i saw the box arrive in them mail, i was very diappointed, it was tiny! During the construction period i started to becom happier with thi s set with its incredible detail, scale, and sheer presence!(not compared to the Imperial Star Destroyer of course)When i finished with this set i was impressed. But after a few eeks now, it seems to be getting smaller, and the back poles are sagging down ( i wish lego sorted this out beforehand). Mabye i'm thinking like this because i'm only thirteen, and this is my first UCS set.

But anyway, I would reccomend this to any lego collector, it is really a must-have addition to any collection

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-29T03:33:33Z","Great but not the Best","I bought it from shopstarwars.com and finished it yesterday. It is great, with all those details which we never see in other USCs. But, if you ask me, it is not the best among the USCs. At least behind the snowspeeder and the X-wing fighter, not mentioned the Star Destroyer anyway.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-27T23:01:40Z","A real gem, with a couple of flaws","This set definitely has the presence of other UCS sets, and looks great on a shelf or on a desk. It took me the better part of a day to finish, but that really is the point of a 1400+ piece set, isn't it?  The build experienc was marred by the fact that TLG forgot to include any of the orange-red pipe rods that decorate the main body of the ship.  :( Other than that, I was pleased by the Y's incorporation of disparate elements into a spectacular whole. (the ship included parts from lego's awful 2001 Racers line, as well as huge 3-spoke wheels on the engines) The cockpit-section of the ship is very faithful to the shape of the cockpit in the movies, unlike that of the smaller, fig-scale Y, though the rest of the ship is very accurate as well.  The large amount of tiny pieces used on the body of the ship lend it a gritty, &quot;real&quot; feel that the smaller Y lacks, and that makes it look just like an old Rebel fighter.  The dark grey slopes with scratched caution stripes that appear midway down the main body only help in that regard. Some have mentioned that the engines start to sag with time; I have had it one month, with no sagging.  it would have been nice if the white hemispheres on the engines had been affixed by means less obtrusive than eight white space-guns, thereby making the Y more accurate. oh well. My main problem with the set is its evil EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEvil decals.  I managed to mess up the THREE SEPARATE DECALS on the cockpit canopy,so now it looks pretty sad.  And these are what I call no-second-chances decals, too, which means that, unlike most lego decals, you can't peel them off without leaving a nasty residue if you misalign them slightly .  However, the overall magnificence of the set compensates for the decals, and merits a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolord909","2007-08-21T20:34:01.19Z","The best set I have","As soon as I opened the box I loved this set.  At first when I saw the box I was a little dissapointed.  The box was not as big as I thought it would be and therefore I assumed the model would not be either.  But when I saw how many pieces there were I almost flipped out.  Building is tons of fun because of all the unique detail it had.  That's probably the best feature in this set.  The actual model is very well designed and extremely sturdy.  I think the display stand is too.  That's the best part about the UCS Legos, the stand.  The only down side for me is that the stand does not hold the ship up very well.  Ocassionally the ship will sag to the side a little and even when it's stood up the right way it doesn't stand up completely straight.  The other complaint most people have is that they don't include a Y-Wing Pilot. No pilot is not a problem with me.  I think putting a pilot in the cockpit would ruin the set and make it look like a regular Y-Wing and not a USC model.  And don't forget, they did include R-4, so it's not like there aren't any minifigures at all.  Overall, this is a great set and by far the best one I have. It's the perfect centerpiece to any collection.  Buy this one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Skodyna","2010-10-19T17:36:07.747Z","One of the best UCS","<p>I got this set yesterday from Ebay for fair price, it is not easy to find one in good condition, but not overpriced. But this set was definitely worth the time I spend on seeking it, it is amazing! Believe me, I have a few UCS sets (Falcon, Stardestroyer...) and altough this is not so big, it definitely looks as good as the others. In fact, I think that this is one of the best-looking Star Wars sets ever. But enough of this, I know, that a lot of people read only pros and cons, so here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Huge! You may be surprised, how big this model looks, after all, 1400 parts is quite a number. 
<li>Great parts! Especially those brown-orange coloured. 
<li>Looks great! Just like in the movie, except for one thing - I will mention it in cons. 
<li>Highly detailed! No more words, just&nbsp;look&nbsp;how it is covered with tiny pieces, creaiting a lot of details. 
<li>Great stand! It is quite unusual to mention stand as a pro, but this one is really good! It leans a bit, so the Y-Wing cand be leaned side- or backwards when diplayed and attract your attention.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looks great, but... some complain, that the engines are too long. It is true that they are a bit longer than in the movie (not the whole engine, those white sticks' lenght&nbsp;is ok, but the main engine block is about 6 studs longer than it should be), but c'mon, people, you cannot know how many types of Y-Wings were in the Rebel army. For me it is important that the model looks great as a whole, so this is not much as a con for me. 
<li>Not much a minifigure size. This Y-Wing is more minifig size than its smaller LEGO brothers in my opinion, but still, it is too big. Of course I modified it imediately and seated a pilot in the cockpit and his gunner in the back, but suprisingly I had a lot of trouble doing that, there is not much space. Therefore I think that especially the cockpit allows you to present this fighter as a new add-on to your Rebel fleet, where the proud minifig pilot will not feel shameful.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>If&nbsp;you like LEGO SW UCS sets and are able to appreciate the beauty of this not-so-famous model (compared to X-Wing for example), you definitely HAVE to buy it. And for all the younger builders, who prefer to fly their LEGO fighters and crash them into their sibling's head, this Y-Wing can handle it, unlike some other UCS sets. This one will not break in half in your hands easily. </p>
<p>Ok seriously, this set was a big suprise for me, not many people have it, but it is because they don't know, how awesome this Y-Wing is. I higly recommend it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"VideoGameLord613","2008-10-20T15:49:00.047Z","&quot;We're using Y-wings because of their greater firepower. But they move like a sleepy Hutt, so watch it.&quot;","This is a very big set. About the same size as Boeing 787 Dreamliner (10177). It comes with an R2 unit that's red. It has 30 steps with 4173 pieces. Like the Vader's TIE Advanced, it has a display base and card. The Y-Wing's base's cannot be posed.

Massive
comes with R2 unit
fun to build

"Blitzr","2010-01-25T23:45:10.623Z","Awesome detail","I have only just managed to pick this set up a week ago. A lot of the UCS stuff is not easy to come by if you live outside of the capitol cities in Australia. Still, it is now long out of production, so you will be looking to ebay and other trading sites to find one.

Was it worth the effort? Hell YES! I ended up paying a little of the Au RRP price, but I still managed to get a set that was brand new and still sealed in the box. There are probably very few like this in captivity.

So after that moment of ecstasy when you first open up a new toy (something about the smell of new Lego always ignites the child in me), I set about the task of sorting the parts. Over 1400 bricks in total (more than the X Wing) with an surprising number being very small (lots of 2x1 and 2x2 sized parts).

The instructions are well laid out. You start by building the hull, followed by the mounts for the engine nacelles,  the engine nacelles and finally the cockpit. There are a few areas where you may as well grab double the parts asked for as you will need to go back and build the same again (this is pretty much limited to the engine nacelles). What surprised me the most was the large number of details on the model that are asymmetrical...I was at first put off by this. But, once you get past the initial shock, it actually makes building the model a lot easier. Each of the main sections join together using Technic plugs. It as a VERY solid model once together...a lot more so than the XWing.

There are a few small decals. This would be the only part that I am not happy about. Personally, I abhor the idea of putting stickers onto my Lego bricks. I understand it is done to keep the costs down, but really, we are talking about UCS kits here...only people that REALLY want one will buy it and if it cost an extra $10-20 more for a few printed parts, then the hardcore fans would not hesitate. As a side note, there are in fact two printed bricks in this set!
Needless to say, the sticker sheet now lives in the box, I won't be popping them on.

The level of detail is insane. The model is simply covered with little accents and bits all over the place. The hull is literally covered in details, you will find very few flat surfaces on the model. The exception is the nose section. Great use of colour (i really love the 'rust' coloured bricks all over) really adds the over all impact this model has. Some excellent design make this a fantastic display piece. 

Just a note on the stand. it is pretty much a single position stand. This has the YWing tilted slightly off to one side. Personally, I love it! It displays the model best to show off the insane level of detail that this model has. To mount it like either the XWing of the Tie Interceptor would be a waste. The YWing is also a LOT longer than either, so it makes a lot me sense (to me at least) to mount it with it's profile offered.

All in all, a fantastic model. Very hard to come by (at least brand new and sealed) these days, so if the opportunity presents itself...jump!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ethiel","2010-09-24T11:35:34.007Z","One of the underrated UCS-Sets","The Y-Wing is one of the less popular UCS-Sets. I believe this is due to the Y-Wing itself, which isn't as famous as X-Wing, Star Destroyer or Millenium Falcon. For sure the set itself is fantastic.<br><br><br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Very, very detailled. The chassis is covered with tiny little bars, Grills and stuff.<br></li><li>Pretty Large</li><li>A lot of fun to build! Even the building of the second engine was fun, and I hate building the same Things over and over again.</li><li>Cute little R-4 Droid included :)</li><li>A sturdy set. If you want to take it out of its stand, run around ludicrously, swinging the ship while saying ""woooosh"", you can do so ;) Size and balance point are great for this.<br></li><li>The angle of the stand can be changed slightly for different positions.</li><li>Still cheap to get! ~100-120 € on eBay for a 1473-Piece-UCS-Set? That's a bargain!</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>It could have been a bit more accurate. The Cockpitpane is too big, the Engines a bit too long.<br></li><li>The humongous amount of detail makes it very hard to clean. Just so much stuff on it....<br></li><li>The ion-cannons on top of the cockpit turn much to easily. While the set is resting on its stand, the cannons tend to turn left because of the gravity.</li><li>no minifig-scale.</li><li>After a long time on the shelf, the poles on the back of the engine lean down. But no problemo, just pull the back part of the engine of, turn it 180 degrees and put it on again. Problem solved.</li><li>Stickers. Is printing pieces so expensive?<br></li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><br>The UCS-Y-Wing is a great set for Star-Wars-Fans, Geeks and Nerds. Anyone else might have problems to recognize it as a Star Wars Model. The Y-Wings just isn't as iconic. It still looks great, but it requires some amount of effort to keep it clean and pretty. The way it is fixed on it's stand is just perfect for displaying it. It looks very dynamic in this angle. Even if you're not a fan of the Y-Wing, you should consider buying it. It's not the greatest UCS, but it deserves the best value-for-money-UCS-Award.<br><br>Overall, I would give it 4.6-4.7 Bricks<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,2,5
