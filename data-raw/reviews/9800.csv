Sorry, it just becomes overly repetitive.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-10-05T09:43:11.277Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 8) - Downhill Skier Review","This minifig is a good figure but for some reason it's my least favourite minifig from series 8. Maybe it's, because we got a skier with series 2 before. However the downhill skier looks pretty good though. We get some pink skis and two ski poles as accessories. What I don't like about the figure is that the back of the legs are not printed.<br><br>All in all it's a good set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-03T11:10:26.31Z","We Shall Ski","<p>Set #8833 Downhill Skier: Another great Female Mini-Fig from Series 8, we've had a skier before, but you can never have too many skis.</p>
<p>The Downhill Skier is a female Mini-Fig, she's wearing a purple jacket with zippers to seal her pockets up and she certainly looks like she'll be kept warm while skiing. It is a single-sided torso print, her legs are two toned, light blue for the ski pants and solid white for the ski shoes/boots. Not much in the way of printing sadly. She's also wearing a pair of dark pink goggles to keep the snow out of her eyes, which means her head is kind of limited in its uses for MOCs, a shame LEGO didn't give her a double-sided head. She could sorely use one for when she's not rushing down the slopes and just hanging at the ski lodge drinking hot chocolate with her fellow winter sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This is my first time with the LEGO skis and ski poles, both pieces are pure awesome, I enjoy the level of detail in their construction. And I can see a lot of useful possibilities for them in Winter and Christmas Themed displays. (Even a fun comical Hoth display in LEGO Star Wars could benefit from such great pieces.) Her blonde hair piece was first used with Series 1's Doctor Mini-Fig and we've seen it get a lot more use ever since.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that the Downhill Skier is definitely a great looking Mini-Fig, even with the minimal detail printing they've given her. Stick her next to the other Skier and the Snowboarders and you've got a great looking group of friends having fun during the Holidays.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-05-28T01:38:20.577Z","an OVERUSED trope!","<p>The seventh figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Downhill Skier. She was released in 2012, retailed for 3 dollars, and includes 9 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that pony-tail hairpiece caste in that blonde colouring. The piece isn&#39;t anything too special, but it seems to fit the figure for me. I will say, it&#39;s a sorely overused piece already, even in the span of Series 1-8, including the Team GB Series, and it only gets worse in future series&#39;. Anyway, back to this figure, I do still really like that hair piece, even though it isn&#39;t too special, and I like how it has some moulding on the front, the top, and of course, on the pony-tail itself. I will say, though, out of all the times this was used in a CMF, the inclusion here, in this colour, is perhaps the most interesting of all. I love that blonde colouring for it so much, and it may have even been new back in the day. So while it isn&#39;t really that special, I love it anyway, mostly for its colouring.</p>

<p>Next is her head, which features those&nbsp;purple and pink goggles covering the eyes. She also has those red lips. I do like that face, but I think this figure needs an alternate expression that&#39;s just a generic female face, as that would make it a bit more useful; plus, the figure&#39;s face is currently always stuck skiing, which is a bit unfortunate.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which does have some really great printing. That jacket is super useful, and the colours on it are fantastic, having the light purple base with white and magenta stripes. I like the white on the bottom, the small zippers on the sides, and also the large magenta zip down the middle. I like the choice of having white gloves as well. But unfortunately, she has absolutely no back torso printing, which is super sad, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which are interesting indeed. This was several years before dual-moulded legs, so the sky blue colour is printed on the white base. I like how those colours look together, and I like the black lines on front, though it seems like they should carry on the sides.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessories. Neither of them are new to the figure, but I think the colours for those snowboards might&#39;ve been new back in the day, being the magenta colour that they are. I love the inclusion of her skis as well, though they weren&#39;t new or anything in that colour. I love how thin the long parts are, and I like the tiny details at the bottom tip of them. All 4 accessories are great, and absolutely necessary to the figure.</p>

<p>That is all for this minifigure! Overall, this is a gender swap of the Series 2 Skier, which was released in 2010 in Series 2. We then got the Snowboarder in 2011, Series 3, followed by the Snowboarder Guy in Series 5, 2011. In other words, I&#39;m pretty sick of the winter-sports trope in CMF&#39;s, especially since the latter two figures I mentioned were pretty awful. The Series 2 Skier was possibly my favourite of the series, so do I like this gender swap? My answer is yes, but don&#39;t get me wrong, the choice of having a female skier this soon is a bit drab to me. But surprisingly, I do sort of like this figure, and I don&#39;t really know why. It could be the hair, maybe the torso, or maybe even both. However, at the end of the day, this is just a gender swap, so she doesn&#39;t feel super fresh at all. In the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 2, just because she isn&#39;t original at all. But that is it for this long review, so thanks for reading.</p>
