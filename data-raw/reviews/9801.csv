"Odeinoichus","2017-01-17T20:06:29.65Z","Give me an A!","<p><strong>Set #8833 Red Cheerleader:</strong> I&#39;m a fan of anything in LEGO that will expand the look of a decent LEGO City display, and multiple Cheerleaders are a must for sports arenas and the like. This final character from Series 8 is much needed for two distinct teams, Series 1 had a blue top and here is her rival.</p>

<p>No dual-sided prints or dual-molded parts, it was not yet introduced. So here we have legs with skirt printing and printing for the socks and bare knees of the character, and a simple top design with a large letter A on the front. Her hair piece is a dark brown in colour and her facial print is an open smile with a slightly visible tongue. Her accessories are the two pom-poms from LEGO and are white with red printing on top.</p>

<p>Strongly recommend tracking her down and getting a small army for some good display options with LEGO Sport Arenas for MOC fans and LEGO City display aficionados. She&#39;s one of the strongest offerings from this Series.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-08-06T23:49:42.15Z","okay, but what LAZY choice!","<p>The thirteenth figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Red Cheerleader. This has 7 pieces, retailed for 3 dollars, and was released in 2012. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that long pony-tail piece in black, which I think might have been new for the figure in that colouring back in the day. It does fit the figure to me, and it has some good detail, though it isn&#39;t the most complex piece&nbsp;out there. I do have one complaint with it, though. I&#39;ll save that for the end, because it is basically a complaint that affects the entire figure.</p>

<p>Next is the head piece, which has a nice expression. I like it when minifigures are enjoying their day, and this figure certainly seems joyful. The open-mouth smile is fitting, and I like the eyelashes around the eyes. No back facial printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which I do have the same problem with this as I do with the hair, but I&#39;ll save that for the end as well. For now, I wanna talk about the printing itself, which is pretty good. I love the red skivvy she has on, especially with that &quot;A&quot; in the centre. However, she has no back printing. It&#39;s cool&nbsp;how her arms are plain yellow, though.</p>

<p>Finishing off the framework of the figure herself, we have her legs. Once again, I have that same complaint as before, but we&#39;ll get to that in a bit. The yellow flesh printed on not only the front, but also the sides is great, as is the shorts on top.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her two pompoms. As you may&#39;ve guessed, I have the same complain again, but it&#39;s nothing to do with the accessories themselves, which are pretty great. I actually really love the moulding, and also the red printing on top. And obviously, they&#39;re highly fitting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, she has good printing, and some okay&nbsp;detail, so as far as the figure itself goes, she isn&#39;t too bad. But as I&#39;ve mentioned several times, I have one major complaint with this figure, which is actually embedded in the title of her. See, she&#39;s called the &quot;red cheerleader.&quot; Well that&#39;s because there already was a cheerleader figure back in Series 1, which had this same hair piece in a new colour, a torso that looked a lot the same besides colour differences, legs with the same problem, and pompoms with blue printing instead of red. In other words, this is one of the laziest CMF&#39;s ever. It&#39;s literally almost the same figure, just with a red colour scheme. At the most, LEGO could&#39;ve easily changed the hair piece. But nope. Just a new colour. And again, I want to like her because she is an okay minifigure, but it&#39;s just such a lazy choice that it&#39;s hard for me to do that. But still, in the end, I&#39;m gonna be generous and give her a 3 out of 5, because she does look neat. Anyways, that&#39;s it for the figure, so thank you for reading!</p>
