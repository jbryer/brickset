"Odeinoichus","2012-11-14T19:37:53.5Z","Up on the Rooftop Reindeers Pause...","<p>Set #8833 Santa: It took eight series of Collectible Mini-Figures and a fair number of years on top of that, but LEGO finally has given us a Mini-Figure for Holiday Displays that is worthy of the name Santa.</p>
<p>Ok, so the torso printing suffers a bit from having a white trim that isn't painted strong enough so it comes off as more a pink color, but it's still worthy. And perhaps with a bit of luck we'll see LEGO re-use this torso printing in a regular set release or a Advent Calendar with the stronger white paint.</p>
<p>Santa has become a mainstay of holiday tradition, you can't go anywhere during the holidays without seeing the jolly one. Here in LEGO form he's fairly plain, the torso is not a double-sided print after all however it doesn't need to be. Santa is a traditional design and look to him that very rarely requires embellishments.</p>
<p>He's got his sash, his belt and even his bag full of toys. A very nice piece, that we might see used for a burglar or someone in a later City set. The fisherman's beard is nice to see being re-used to give him the traditional Santa beard, and underneath that is a big smiling facial print complete with bushy white eyebrows. Then there's the hat, much better than the old Pirate bandana headgear, this is a santa hat with white trim and pom-pom, unfortunately it's designed to fit on the head only one way. So you can't really swap the hat around otherwise you'll cover up old St. Nick's eyes.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is one of the stand-out, must-haves of Series 8 for anyone interested in building up a Holiday Themed display during the Holidays. If only the white trim was painted on the torso better so it didn't come off as pink this would be absolutely perfect, I kind of wish his feet were painted black for Santa's black boots. Perhaps if the character appears in another set they'll go that extra mile. Still strongly recommended. (Even if you don't celebrate Christmas)</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,5
"sideswinger","2021-06-09T17:41:01.44Z","a CLASSIC Santa, but where's the BOOTS?","<p>The tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is Santa. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that Christmas hat that was new for the figure. Of course, it&#39;s one of the best parts of the figure, and it looks so fantastic! It&#39;s all caste in white, with the red being printed rather than dual-moulded, which is still pretty great. The moulding around the white, fluffy rim is great as well, and it even has the white pom-pom at the tip of the hat. Overall, I could gush and gush about how fantastic that hat looks, but I suppose it&#39;s time to move on.</p>

<p>Next is his head, and to be honest, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the printing it has. First, we have those grey and white, bushy eyebrows. I like the white colour they have, but with that beard and hat on, it looks like he&#39;s a bit angry, with how arched the eyebrows are at the top. I don&#39;t like that, since it makes him look not-so-jolly. However, with the beard removed, he has this big smile. But I think more problems come with that. First off, the smile has no teeth printing or anything; it&#39;s just a plain white mouth, and I think that looks strange. Also, Santa is jolly, but not&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;jolly; it makes him look a bit umm...creepy. And then the last issue I have with the face, is that it really lacks any detailing besides the mouth, eyes, and eyebrows, and I expect maybe some old-man wrinkles or something beneath that beard. But he has none, which makes him look young; however, the eyebrows are clearly grey, which makes him look old, so he ends up looking like either a young man trying to look old, or an old man trying to look young, and is ultimately sa bad design. He has no alternate expression, either,</p>

<p>Next is the beard, which was nothing new or exclusive; in fact, it was the most common colouring for that piece back in 2012, the year of its release. But I would say it&#39;s the most iconic part of Santa Claus, so it looks absolutely fantastic here. It&#39;s caste in a rubber material as well, which is an interesting choice, but I&#39;m used to it at this point, so it&#39;s okay. And the moulding on it is really&nbsp;great as well, with the carved-out moustache, and also the texturing at the bottom of the beard.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which includes some more highly iconic details, with that big black belt that has the gold buckle, as well as the white, furry trim that&nbsp;occupies the bottom, and the middle. The white gloves are nice features too. However, he has no back printing, which it seems like that belt should, in theory, carry on to the back, but oh well. I will say, though, the white on the torso isn&#39;t printed strong enough, which makes it look a pinkish tone, but that&#39;s a common problem for not only old figures, but even in new ones.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, which are pretty disappointing, since he seriously lacks the severely iconic black boots. I understand that dual-moulded legs weren&#39;t made back then, but they&#39;ve printed black boots for previous CMF&#39;s, and this seems like a dire situation to do that.</p>

<p>Lastly, his accessory is that big sack, caste in nougat. Of course, it&#39;s insanely fitting, and is a perfect accessory. It was new for the figure as well, and it features lots of great moulded detail.</p>

<p>That is all for this figure! Overall, this ties for my favourite in the series with a few other figures. This is just so crazily iconic, and, besides the lack of black boots, appears extremely faithful to classic Santa Claus himself. And while I don&#39;t think this is the best Santa minifigure any more, it was the best Santa by far back in 2012, and the inclusion of two new pieces was fantastic as well. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 5 out of 5! That&#39;s all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
