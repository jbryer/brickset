Yodle-ay-e-hoo? Ahem, anyway here's another Mini-Figure from Series 8, not exactly one of the big-in-demand kinds from what I can see. Still a solid little Mini-Fig with some great printing, also perfect for Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>Lederhosen Guy is just that, a guy dressed up in a traditional Lederhosen costume, the printing on this guy is just great. It's all single-sided, unfortuantely, however the torso, leg and even facial printing all look perfect. He's wearing a white shirt with yellow buttons, and the green straps with detailing as part of the Lederhosen. The print on the legs carries down from the shirt on the belt, and then onto the legs itself from the belt&nbsp;with all the impressive detail. He's wearing light brown shoes, the yellow paint on the legs used to show the Mini-Figures' bare legs below the knees doesn't quite match up with the color of yellow used for the skin pieces, hands and face, even the slight bit of neckline you see from his open color matches better to the actual LEGO Mini-Figure standard skin color than what is found on the legs. (This isn't new, for some reason painted yellow on prints to show off 'skin' tend to suffer from lack of matching to the skin tone.)</p>
<p>The Forestmen Cap he's wearing is a rich dark green, matching the dark green color of the painted Lederhosen, and he has two white feathers, so you have a spare. The only accessory given to this gentleman is the Giant Pretzel, a great new piece much like the French Bread we've seen in the past.</p>
<p>Overall this is a fun little Mini-Figure, made all the better by the facial expression and printing, I enjoy the small gray moustache and eyebrows and the big tooth filled smile, he's happy to be wherever he is in LEGO world. All we need now are a few more of this type of Mini-Figure to make a proper Oktoberfest Scene, perhaps with a new Brautwerst piece and a mug for Ale. It's always nice to see different cultures represented in LEGO form, a few more Mini-Figures like this, the Flamenco Dancer and the Geisha and we can have our very own 'Small World' Theme Park MOC. Er, but I digress, this is a good Mini-Figure, for adults. Children might not be as impressed by him as some of the others in the Series though.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,2,3
"sideswinger","2021-05-26T02:51:38.903Z","not my favourite, but one of the BEST!","<p>The third figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Lederhosen Guy, otherwise known as the Pretzel Guy. He was released in 2012, he retailed for three bucks, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that pointy hat, which is a piece that&#39;s pretty rare in the world of CMF&#39;s, only appearing in the Forestman from Series 1. Actually, come to think of it, this figure&#39;s hat and face have a striking resemblance to the Forestman. However, the Forestman&#39;s hat was caste in plain green, while this Pretzel Guy&#39;s hat is a very dark green tone, which appears very appealing to me. Of course, it&#39;s a pretty unconventional piece, and is by far one of the least appearing hat pieces in LEGO in general. Of course, once again, like the Forestman from Series 1, he has a feather attached to the edge of his hat, though it&#39;s caste in white instead of red this time around. I like that feather piece since it&#39;s different from the normal feather quill piece.</p>

<p>Next is the face and head, which also appears very similar in facial features to the Series 1 Forestman, where we have that tiny, two-pieced moustache in a light brown tone, which I suppose does differ from the Forestman a bit. The tiny, thin eyebrows are nice as well, and I love his big, happy smile. Still, it&#39;s slightly humorous how similar he is to the Forestman in general. Of course, no alternate expression, which is great since it&#39;d be severely exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which features some marvellous detail, where we do have those dark green straps and the green stitched design in the centre. Of course, that white undershirt appears fitting, with the thin green lines. However, it stinks that he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have really complex printing for 2012, to where all the green parts are printed. The white stitches on it are good too, and I love how his yellow flesh is printed on the front and sides, and how the green progresses to the sides as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have that pretzel piece as an accessory, giving this figure the nickname &ldquo;Pretzel Guy.&rdquo; I&#39;m assuming that pretzel was new to the figure, but I could be wrong about that. Either way, I love how that piece looks, and it&#39;s one of my favourite food pieces ever, where we have those thin, round edges. I also like the small indentions in the middle of the pretzel where the figure holds it via a handle connection.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I really love this figure. Granted, I don&#39;t quite love him as much as I once did, especially after discovering the lack of back printing. But nonetheless, the printing on him is pretty fantastic, and I just love that pretzel accessory. So while it&#39;s slightly on the tier, it is one of my favourites of the series. So thanks for reading!</p>
