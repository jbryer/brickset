<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Useful headset piece.<br></li><li>Nicely designed CD-disc.<br></li><li>Pretty light blue CD-case with two funny guys on it.</li><li>Nice torso. The dark green arms look good, and the minifig-head with the scales on it is a very good touch!</li><li>Realistic jeans. The whole leg piece reminds me to the nowadays' teenager wear.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Headset can't be removed, it is a lone element with the hair piece.<br></li><li>The head looks strange to me. And his mouth looks like an arrow.</li><li>As overpriced as the other collectable minifigs.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, it's a good idea and a good minifig. It's not my favourite, but I like it because of the rare and interesting parts.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2012-11-14T15:38:28.317Z","Let's get this partay started!","<p>Set #8833 DJ: I feel extremely foolish for doing this, but when I bought a few Series 8 Mini-Figs last month I wound up getting duplicates of this dude on the exact same purchase. My own fault for being in a rush and not feeling it out enough, or taking the time to try and make out the dots on the back of the package. Personally I really wish LEGO would either figure out a better method for blind packing these things, similar to how Series 1 &amp; 2 went or introduce an even case ratio with color coded dots for each MF.</p>
<p>I'm not too mad at myself for scoring two of this guy though, the DJ is a bit on the spartan side when it comes to printed detailing. However he's still a very impressive looking Mini-Fig, and the accessories, even though they are simply printed plate pieces to represent a vinyl record and its case are still fun looking and intriguing enough to stand out as decent accessories.</p>
<p>I'm guessing the record is called DJ something Hollywood Games, I can't make out the word after DJ. The hairpiece has headphones attached to it, a wonderful new style of piece that can work out quite nicely in future sets and for future Mini-Figs. (Examples: Someone holding an IPod/Walkman, or an Airline Traffic Director with Airport sets.)</p>
<p>When I first saw his pants I almost thought Han Solo for a moment there, the printing is pretty sparse as I said, mostly a belt and zippered pockets. The top he's wearing also has a simple looking LEGO head design which kind of reminds me of one of those auido level displays on old school leveling and mixing audio equipment from the radio stations. (And the like)</p>
<p>His facial printing is pretty standard for LEGO City style MFs as well. Overall I'd say this little guy is impressive, and I'm hopeful we'll see the hairpiece used on other MFs in the future, perhaps even a re-design for Female MFs so, if I happen to get two of the Female version I could swap around some parts with my dupe of this one.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

And since this is a celebration, I decided to review my last minute Christmas miracle, the DJ. (I'm not even kidding! This is one of those really cool minifigs, and just when Series 9 is about to come out and I can't get it anymore, I get it!) </p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>The hairpiece! The headphones work really well. </li><li>Love the printing. The sweater with the minifig head is really cool. </li><li>The LMFAO style record and case are really amazing! True DJing tools!</li></ul><p><strong>Cons: </strong></p><ul><li>You can't remove the headphones...</li><li>You'd think he'd come with TWO records, you know, to mix them... </li></ul><p>This is my 2nd LEGO Minifigures review and my last review for the year!

"tkettle9719","2012-11-22T11:06:08.257Z","DJ Hero","<p>I got this set along with the Fairy at Target a few weeks ago, and was rather happy to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;this particular guy. His accessories are rather detailed and cool, and the hair is just awesome and double-purpose, interchangeable. This is an excellent figure.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The hairpiece used here is awesome; it is almost a regular hairpiece, but is even cooler because it has the earphones attached to it.&nbsp;</li><li>The two accessories used here are rather nice; the disc has a variation of the logo that's on the cover, and both are totally related.&nbsp;</li><li>The design on the shirt is also rather cool; it is very colorful for the main logo, and it just fits.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The figure in general feels rather genetic; the only new piece (realistically) is the headpiece, which feels quite familiar.&nbsp;</li><li>I feel somewhat confused on the color scheme; it shouldn't matter, but it does to me.&nbsp;</li><li>I also feel that the jeans are not correct; no men's jeans that I've ever seen have bling on them, especially near the pockets.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent rendition of the DJ stereotype; it's shirt is very nice and noticeable, the disc cover is nice, and I dig the hairpiece. However, the set feels unoriginal to me, which really can't be helped. I recommend it if you have the Rapper or the Disco Dude.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"sideswinger","2021-06-13T01:10:54.083Z","great, ORIGINAL series!","<p>The twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the DJ. He was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair/headphone combo, which was new for the figure. Boy, I love that piece so much, and the silver headphones are printed rather than dual-moulded, which is okay. They still look fantastic. The black wavy moulding on the hair looks incredible as well, and it has some great detailing.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which has a pretty generic face, and I appreciate that. The smirk is very welcome, as is the creases around the eyes, and those bushy eyebrows are also really great. He has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which has some fantastic detailing all around. Starting with the front, I adore that minifigure head design with the different colours, and how they&#39;re all stacked up. The &quot;U&quot; on top also looks good. I think one of the coolest things about the torso is those dark green arms, and how well they contrast with the grey shirt. Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t have any back printing.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have even more fantastic detail. I adore the black and silver belt, and it&#39;s extremely useful, especially since it has those pockets. They&#39;re just so very&nbsp;useful, and are great on the figure.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his two accessories. The first of which is that record, which is printed on that round 2x2 tile. I adore that print, and it&#39;s extremely useful as well. I like the shiny silver part in the middle, and I like all the printed silver grooves surrounding it. The second accessory is that 2x2 record case, which also has some great printing, and remains pretty useful, even to this day.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and overall, he&#39;s not bad whatsoever! I will say, he isn&#39;t necessarily my favourite of the series, but he certainly isn&#39;t one of the worst. I love how many useful pieces he has, and it&#39;s an original idea as well. Overall, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 4 out of 5! That&#39;s all for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
