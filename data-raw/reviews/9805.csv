They even included a new cowboy hat piece combined with a hairpiece (kinda like the Equestrain Rider in the Olympics range). Most creative. This minifigure is kinda like Dale Evans (Roy Rogers' wife and real-life cowgirl) and the leg printings look fantastic.<br><br>I even got this minifiugre before its release date off E-bay. I'm not gonna mention the price, but it was a great bargain. Now, to think of a name for this figure; she will be...Annie Jane Canary. Put here on a LEGO horse and she's participating in a rodeo!<br><br>I'd recommend this minifigure to any LEGO Western fan out there.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Comes with a new cowgirl hat - detailed in the back, on top, and in the front</li><li>Comes with a lasso, which is always&nbsp;useful</li><li>The&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;is new</li><li>The pants are new</li><li>The face is new (I think)</li><li>With all these new pieces, at least some of them half to be Chinese plastic, right? Well, I can happily say, even if they are, you can't tell. &nbsp;The pants raise the most suspicion, but the even they are missing that usual slightly transparent, McDonald's toy&nbsp;appearance.</li><li>The <i>perfect </i>expansion to any Western collection</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Four bucks for one minifigure - and that's being picky</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I have to admit it's hard to write a review of this set, since there's nothing to criticize. &nbsp;If you have a Western collection, this is a <i>must </i>buy. &nbsp;If you're a girl, this is one of the few female minifigures that is nearly perfect. &nbsp;True, this isn't exactly the 'coolest'&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;minifig ever made, but there's nothing to complain about except the eye-brow-raising pants.&nbsp;</p><p>Five bricks!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-12-26T14:42:55.037Z","YEEHAW! Round'em Up!","<p>Set #8833 Cowgirl: This is a really great offering from Series 8 Collectible Mini-Figures, not only does it re-use parts from Toy Story (Jessie's Hat and Woody's Lasso if I'm not mistaken.), but it offers up a great addition to any Mini-Figure collection.</p>
<p>The Cowgirl has one admittedly minor flaw, her torso print is only one-sided, so you get to see her white with blue checkered pattern outfit with the tassles from the front, but on the back she's got just a plain white LEGO Mini-Figure torso. The lack of a double-sided torso is curious, admitedly though it is really a minor flaw, her legs have two different colors with some minor printing for her cowgirl boots and the belt she's wearing. Her head has a great facial print, with a personal favorite of mine, freckles and a big tooth filled smile.</p>
<p>Overall this is a really good looking Mini-Figure and great for anyone's collection. The fact that she's carrying a lasso and wearing the hat from Jessie of Toy Story 2 fame really just adds to the desireability of this figure. Feeling out the hat is the best way to find her, as the Lasso isn't as obvious with the feel method. Strongly reccomended for collectors of Mini-Figs, and female Mini-Figs too.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-05-26T21:01:00.25Z","FAVOURITE in the SERIES???","<p>The fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 8 is the Cowgirl. She was released in 2012, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. And keep in mind, this is a gender swap of the Series 1 Cowboy.&nbsp;So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair-hat combo, which is an amazing piece. My older brother happened to get this figure back in the day, so I can give a more detailed review of her since I have it on-hand. That hair-hat combo is pretty adorable, where it is dual-moulded: white on top, nougat on bottom. And the shaping on the hat section is marvellous, where the large indention around the rim of it is accurate to a real western hat. The hair part of it is nothing too special, but I do like the slight moulding on the ponytail. Of course, the gold star printing in the centre is appealing as well.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which includes some fantastic detail. The freckles on her cheeks look swell, and of course, her huge smile with the red lipstick are both great features, and it makes this figure more unique. I also love her exaggerated eyelashes. No alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is the torso printing, and wow, it looks amazing. I&#39;m not sure where to start, so let&#39;s just say the printing is great, with a combination of red-flower stitching, amazing light blue plaid, and some fantastic sky-blue tassels. Of course, she has some nice curve lines as well, but my only problem is that she has no back printing, and it&#39;s severely missing, if you ask me. But I must say, the front printing is pretty fantastic, nonetheless.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have some iconic boots.The brown belt on top is fantastic, and I love the choice of making her pants sand blue, for it contrasts well with her nougat-coloured boots. Speaking of which, the whole legs are caste in the colour of her boots, so the sand blue on the sides is printed, since this was before dual-moulded legs were a thing.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her lasso. Unfortunately, her lasso is missing from my copy of the figure. Perhaps my brother accidentally disposed of it, or perhaps my younger self lost it! But either way, this lasso for an accessory is simply iconic, and I love all the details on it, from the knot on top, to the spacious perimeter of the rope itself. Of course, it is caste in rubber, since it&#39;d be highly fragile of it were plastic.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! I don&#39;t have too many old CMF&#39;s, except the few that my older brother got back in the day; needless to say, I&#39;m not only thankful to now have them in my collection, but I&#39;m glad that I have this particular figure. This is probably my favourite LEGO western minifigure ever, as she&#39;s simply iconic as heck, and is definitely&nbsp;a vast improvement from the Series 1 Cowboy, which was&nbsp;boring in general. I think my favourite in&nbsp;the series is tied with this Cowgirl, Santa Claus, the Diver, and maybe the Pirate Captain. But yeah! All in all, this is such a great figure. That is all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
