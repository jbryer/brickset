This cool little gem of a set that I picked up at LEGOLAND California along with 850487 MF HALLOWEEN SET on Sunday is worth the money if you are lucky enough to come across it somewhere. It has a reused pieces that may be hard to find on their own including 2 Microphone elements, and an awesome Lime-Green Mohawk element reused from the Punk Rocker, though not much else. I found the design of the different components that make up the instruments to be nice and realistic with nice use of the elements to be true to real instruments designs.<br />
The Minifigures are clearly the center of the set as they appear to have been where most of LEGO&#39;s effort were focused. They differ from their original CMS counterpart by use of variations in the elements such as the different head, Torso decal, and hat for the &quot;Singer/Rapper&quot;, the Lime-Green Mohawk used for the &quot;Drummer/Male Punk Rocker&quot; ,the Black hair and reprinted White Torso and Pants for the &quot;Gutairist/Female Punk Rocker&quot;. All the Minifigures also feature new printed pants then their CMS counterparts. The Minifigures also successfully vary from the CMS versions to retain their aspect of being unique.</p>

"Firox_5000","2012-12-13T10:18:23.867Z","Lego Rock Band set","When I saw &nbsp;lego release a mini figure collection of a rock band, I knew I had to buy it when it came out.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The set comes in a small clear plastic box which isn't like the usual lego packaging. Once opened, the figures are technically ready built so it's only the accessories &nbsp;including the drum kit,guitar, mic stand, lights and amps that need building. The building process &nbsp;is very quick and takes less than 5 minutes to complete.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The figures&nbsp;</b></div><div>There are three figures in the set. The first figure is the vocalist of the band who comes with a microphone. He comes with a baseball style hat and bling printed torso and trousers and sunglasses on his head piece giving him a look of more a rapper than singer and also very similar in appearance to the series 3 one from the collectable mini figures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second figure is the guitarist/bass player of the band who is wearing a lightning and stripped patterned torso and leg piece as well as a long and wild hair piece too. The head piece of the figure has a pink lightning stripe and eye makeup and light pink'ish lips showing that the figure is &nbsp;a girl.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third and final figure is the drummer who has a decorated skull printed on his torso and is wearing a green spiked up hair piece giving him a punky look. He also comes with drum stick and a enthusiastic facial expression.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The set</b></div><div>&nbsp;The main object to the whole set is the drum kit. Though it doesn't appear to be the actual traditional layout of a kit, it is easily recognisable with the kick drum, tom drums and also a hi-hat and cymbal too which has a light metallic shine to it. Though not many pieces have been used here, it clearly does resemble a simple drum kit layout.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The next object is the guitar/bass which unlike the drums isn't quite as recognisable as it is made up of many pieces. Though it resembles a guitar/bass, it doesn't quite look like one and also weather it's a guitar or bass.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also two speakers in the set made of just four pieces each but work well as they can be identified as speakers. The set also includes a small stand with a microphone attached [probably for the guitarist] which is a nice added extra to the set. The lights are the final touches to the set and though they're nothing special add to the equipment and lineup making it look like a rock performance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Summary</b></div><div>If you're in to rock bands, a musician, collectable mini figure sets and a rock band set up for stop motions and town displays, this set is definitely for you. If you own at least one &nbsp;[or more] of the series 4 and series 7 guitarists then you'll have a perfect sized rock band with several guitars and a bass.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I genuinely recommend this set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
