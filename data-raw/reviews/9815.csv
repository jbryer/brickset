"FlagsNZ","2014-05-15T07:47:24.15Z","Lego's Minifigure Scrabble set","<p>I bought this set along with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/850426-1/Pencil-Holder"">pencil holder</a>&nbsp;to boost my Lego&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10241-1/Maersk-Line-Triple-E"">Maersk&nbsp;Line Triple E</a> ship order above $300 and therefore get free shipping.</p>

<p>Despite this, I am glad of the purchase and both these sets look good accessorising&nbsp;my office desk.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The striking parts in this set are the 1x1&nbsp;black tiles with silver lettering. Other reviews have inventoried the letters so I won&#39;t do that here.</p>

<p>I would recommend purchasing two of these sets to increase the choice of letters you have available.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I have constructed this model to have the two&nbsp;minifgures&nbsp;play Scrabble. This set could further be customised&nbsp;and used as a giant Scrabble set in a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City"">City</a>&nbsp;park.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>There is little skill required to build this model. The real skill come when designing your Lego business card. I have made a diagonal crossword puzzle to fit everything I wanted to say on the card.</p>

<p>As I said, if you get two sets, you will have better options.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It does look good. I have really raised awareness&nbsp;of Lego at my work.&nbsp;<strong>; )</strong></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a business card holder, it actually works really well. It has a real use on your desk and therefore it is functional and not only a toy.</p>

"Gerbil","2019-10-31T02:51:33.103Z","Awesome letters, odd distribution. Need to buy multiples.","<p>I&#39;ve wanted this set for a long time as I&#39;m such as stickler for LEGO products that I want even my display text to be done in it when we do exhibitions.<br />
However, it went out of production a long time ago, and the nearest replacement was the book with letters in different colours. This too is now out of production.<br />
<br />
So imagine my surprise when our national online LEGO store in Colombia had them for sale!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know how or why, but at roughly $20 USD I had to partake. I ended up buying 10!<br />
<br />
The letters themselves are amazing - well printed and in a metallic ink. In the photos they often look white, but they reflect the light and not only are always easy to read, but look lovely. The LEGO tile is also very welcome.<br />
<br />
The other pieces are nothing special, normal bricks and plates in a variety of primary colours, and the figures, while nice are nothing special. One is male, the other female, although they only differ by the heads.<br />
<br />
So what&#39;s bad about it? The strange letter distribution. Worst of all is that every letter gets at least 2 copies except for the U, which only comes with 1. This is fairly ridiculous, particularly when you think even the Qs and Xs of the world get more. Vowels really should have been 2 minimum, and it would have cost LEGO virtually nothing to add more in.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you really fancy writing things in LEGO, this is your best (only real) option, but you are almost certainly going to need many copies, and if you need to write something with a lot of U&#39;s, then... well, it is going to be tough!<br />
<br />
It loses an overall star because of this.<br />
<br />
I love this set, and it is really adds the final touch to our scenes, as these photos will hopefully show. But you really, really need to buy multiples and at this point, that&#39;s going to be almost impossible.<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s hoping LEGO comes out with something similar in the future!<br />
<br />
