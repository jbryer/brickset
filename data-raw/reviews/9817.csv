Item: 6016932<br />
Price: $14.99 USD<br />

This little impulse buy that I obtained at LEGOLAND California is a nice little set if not just for the concept of it. It contains 3 Minifigures, the CMS Witch (Same as Series, no changes unlike the box might make you think), The Zombie with a Brown Torso and &quot;Torn&quot; Printed Pants, it also includes the new Glow-in-The-Dark Monster Fighters design of Ghost with a Pearl White Torso.<br />
The Grave comes in two parts, shrubbery/bushes, and the Tombstone itself along with 2 snakes (Green &amp; Red), a mouse, bat, and spider (with Minifigures).<br />
The tombstone has a new printed &quot;Bat Letter&quot; 1x2 Tile that is quite cool, and the shrubbery has new Dark-Green &quot;Seaweed&quot; and &quot;Vines&quot;. This set is a must for any Post-Apocalyptic builder, supernatural fan, or, of course, any LEGO fan.</p>

"plantman","2012-09-08T02:37:26.237Z","Really cool halloween or Monster Fighters them set","This is a must have for a halloween or Monster Fighters theme fan.&nbsp; The set contains a zombie, witch, ghost, gravestone and small vine patch.&nbsp; The zombie is has the same printing as the one from series 1 collectible minis, except the suit color is brown instead of the gray.&nbsp; The witch is the exact same witch as the one from series 2 collectible minis.&nbsp; The ghost is the same as the ones in the Monster Fighters theme except he has a chain section to hold.&nbsp; The grave is very cool and goes well with set The Zombies 9465.&nbsp; This set also contains a rat, bat, spider and two snakes.&nbsp; I didn't want to open this set because the packaging is just beautiful - is not a box or polybag but a larger printed clear plastic case that holds the figures fully assembled in the window.&nbsp; The price is a little on the high side - the minis originally sold for $9, leaving $6 for the little tombstone and accessories.&nbsp; Still, you get 3 themed minis with some cool display pieces all in one pack (the pack is reusable - it has a top open flap with a reusable tray that holds the pieces and figures).&nbsp; I would definitely recommend for any fan of halloween, Monster Fighters or even City (put 'em in at halloween)&nbsp;themes.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-09-15T14:36:00.04Z","Horror hordes.","I was somewhat late to the whole Collectible Minifig party, having only taken a (somewhat) serious interest in the series at around Series 5 or so. Hence, a great deal of the horror-themed Minifigs passed me by, and many of them, such as the Zombie (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8683-5"">8683</a>), now fetch relatively high prices on the secondary market - perhaps not prohibitively high, but too much for me to justify spending on one Minifig, anyway.<div><br></div><div>So it's kind of nice that LEGO has decided to do a couple of Collectible Minifig ""Combi-packs"" to give folks a chance to pick up Minifigs that they may have missed from before. At the same time, the Minifigs in the accessory packs also seem to have some slight variations compared to their earlier counterparts so that collectors of the original releases don't feel slighted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would have had only a passing interest at best in this particular collection, but, having purchased the Haunted House (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10228-1"">10228</a>), I felt that adding a little to my burgeoning horror population would be a nice thing. Indeed, the Minifigs are of the quality that you would expect from a Collectible Minifig, though I guess this pack in particular has a relatively pedestrian selection, since the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Fright%20Knights"">Fright Knights</a> did have a witch and the ghost was never a Collectible Minifig but an emigrant from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Monster%20Fighters"">Monster Fighters</a> line, and is also a remake of the old Castle ghost from the mid-nineties or so. The ghost and the zombie were the primary draw to me, since you can never have too many of either.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set also comes with a couple of small builds and loads of weird odds and ends. The main build, if you will, is the unearthed grave, which is very simple but quite elegant for a small build and definitely something that you could realistically make multiples of with spare pieces. There's also some dark green overgrowth, which doesn't seem to represent much of anything to me, and a couple of snakes and spiders, one of which glows in the dark, which is sweet.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At US$15, though, this is a pretty expensive collection, and it doesn't compare favourably to other smaller sets with three Minifigs, such as Freeing Dobby (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4736-1"">4736</a>) or Captain America's Avenging Cycle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6865-1"">6865</a>), <i>both</i> of which are licensed sets and therefore not exactly retailing at bargain prices either. The Minifigs and gravestone go really well with the Haunted House, so I'm not unhappy to have them, but I think I would feel better if this were a couple of dollars cheaper. As such, I would say that this is strictly for fans of the macabre only.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,1

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box is pretty neat--it hearkens back to the old blister packs for action figures from when I was a kid, but it's not a blister, it's a whole reusable package. &nbsp;Plus, all the minifigs come assembled, so it displays really nicely.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not a ton of parts, but some good ones. &nbsp;The headstone has a pretty cool printed piece, and there are some cool odd pieces (frog, bat, rat, snakes, briefcase, phone, chains, vines).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Love the zombie businessman. &nbsp;The witch is nicely detailed and is the same as you can get in Series 2 or 3 of the collectible minifigures. &nbsp;The ghost is beautiful--glows in the dark, has a frown, looks spooky.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not much going on, it's absolutely straightforward and simple, but you're buying it for the minifigs, not the build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The scene works together well. &nbsp;Look at the picture--it can get set up like that. &nbsp;It' nice. &nbsp;If you have the Monster Fighters sets, this is a nice addition. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'm happy with the set. &nbsp;There's too little for the cost, and the build is a bit blah, but overall it's a nice little set. &nbsp;Break it out for your Halloween display!</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,3
