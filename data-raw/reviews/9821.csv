<p>&nbsp;Use this model to discreetly announce to the world, your love of Lego.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing special about the parts. There are &nbsp;bright bands of traditional&nbsp;colours. Lego supplied two HB pencils.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>There is one hard working painter with a roller painting the side of the pencil holder. He is sitting there working tirelessly&nbsp;with a can of paint and a &nbsp;cup of hot chocolate.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a reasonably basic build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This will look good on any desk whether&nbsp;it be at work or home.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have enjoyed raising the awareness of my work colleagues to the potential of Lego in the workplace. There are Lego fans everywhere.</p>
