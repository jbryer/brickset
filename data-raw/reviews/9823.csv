<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - 3 minifigs</li><li>Pro 2 - Useful pieces</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - Stickers instead of printed torsos.</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>This is a really nice set to have. You get 2 males and a female although their torsos aare blank and you need to put stickers, this could be a con for this set or could be a plus :) You also get a cart, a small gasoline thingy and a shelf of bottles. It's worth every penny.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,5

I really like the assortment here of transparent parts. It &nbsp;is at least a straightforward representation of someone working in the lab, with a Shell logo on her dress/gown.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8148023934/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8474/8148023934_73bb0e8641.jpg[/img][/url]</p><p><br></p><p>EXTRA PARTS</p><p><br></p><p>You get a visor, a black tap, a trans clear 1x1 round plate, and a trans clear 1x1 tile.</p><p></p><p>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8148022826/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8049/8148022826_efd585a3d8.jpg[/img][/url]</p><p><br></p><p>OVERALL IMPRESSION</p><p>For the price, this is a good buy. This the only time I get to buy a set that is at least priced similarly abroad. It's even cheaper than the CMFs available locally. The only catch, of course, is the need to fill up with the required amount of fuel. I try to save on gas as much as possible, but the desire to have all of the sets makes want to forget about everything…sorry, mother earth, but this is a once-in-a-blue-moon promo, even if there are no chrome parts…</p><p><br></p><p>I would not expect a mini chemistry lab in the race track and I have no idea why this was included in the “pit crew”. They should at least have given us a fire extinguisher to go with it. &nbsp;The other figs are rather spot on as I could remember seeing them work in flash in some of the races I have seen on TV. But I do remember everybody wearing helmets. Still, though there may be some inappropriateness, they are rather welcome in terms of parts selection.</p><p><br></p><p>The set relies heavily on decals, which is a shame. These should be a whole lot better if the designs were printed on. &nbsp;Realistically, at least the minifigs should have printed torsos.Why TLG decided to do otherwise is beyond me. Notice the lady fig: the white decal is a lot brighter than the actual torso. You could just imagine how these would look like in the future with wear and tear. Also, it take a degree of skill to put these on at the right places without overlapping</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, there is good playability involved in the set. Each fig representing what it takes to make a difference in the race… It’s not just the car; it’s the fuel, too. The parts are varied enough to make each build interesting, not to mention the potential in using them on other MOCs. Lastly, I noticed that the clutch power of the parts seem a lot better than some of the sets I have, which is also a welcome development. Whether or not this is true with the cars will be the subject of my future reviews.</p><p></p><p>[url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/56989301@N04/8147997565/][img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8188/8147997565_6fe988c64a.jpg[/img][/url]</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>Thanks for viewing.

"Chat_Li","2014-08-14T13:09:25.737Z","Sticker? What the...","<p>You can get this Set free, if you fill your car with 30 liter V-Power Racing gas at a Shell gas station. If I calculate (Germany): [1,74 EUR/L (V-Power Gas) - 1,48 EUR/L (normal Gas)] * 30L = 7,8&nbsp;EUR for this&nbsp;set. Okay maybe it is&nbsp;worth.&nbsp;But why Stickers? &nbsp;The only licenced &quot;Parts&quot; of the set are the sticker. Nothing special.</p>
