I would not pay more then $5 for this I got it on Bricklink.com for $2.99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the printing on this Item is incredible and looks true to Lord of the rings. The only thing is it is a little on the &quot;kid friendly&quot; side in terms of looks. Great on the whole and it got me some of my friends Old Lego&nbsp;collection for $20 for a basement full of it.&nbsp;</p>
