"Naylus","2020-07-17T00:28:43.383Z","First Duplo Car","<p>This Truck was one of the first sets in my collection, bought back in 1980s when I was very little. As a kid I had a lot of fun playing with it, as I got&nbsp;more Duplo blocks, and is easily combined with Lego System bricks&nbsp;later.</p>

<p><strong>General Overview</strong><br />
As with other small Duplo sets, this one isn&#39;t rich in details, but serves well as an addition to a Duplo town, if a child wants to make a larger community. It has the yellow base car, which can be combined with other blocks, the red dumper bucket to transport the cargo, the driver in a construction hat,&nbsp;two blue bricks and a grey shovel.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
The yellow base is probably the best thing to start with, if you add bricks from other sets. It&#39;s possible to add a cabin in the back or create a small bus. It can also serve as a main car to attach base cars with open hitch ends for instance to make sort of a large train. Lego Basic bricks can also be added into the driver&#39;s seat to make a peculiar transport like in Time Cruisers or Lego Movie series.</p>
