It was in the Last Jedi packaging, but the keychain was still the same as the original 2012 version. In my opinion, this is a really cool and accurate&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of Darth Vader in LEGO form.</p>

<p>While it may not have been intentional, this key light represents the conflict that is Darth Vader. He is dark and angry on the outside, but he still has some good and some light on the inside.</p>

<p>The light itself comes out of his feet when you push the button on his chest, which matches perfectly with his chest-plate. The figure is close to duplo scale, but the feet do not fit onto duplo bricks. The cape is also made out of a more durable material than it&#39;s minifigure&nbsp;counterpart. While it would be cool if they were to release an updated version of this figure, it would probably be too expensive and may not happen for some time.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this key light. It is accurate to the minifigure&nbsp;it is based on and it has a fun light up feature build in. I would like to get more of these in the future.</p>
