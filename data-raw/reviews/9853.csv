"Odeinoichus","2013-01-02T19:40:06.02Z","Another Great Reference Book...","<p>DKBATMANVD-1 LEGO DC Super Heroes Batman: Visual Dictionary: Like most books published by DK for LEGO this thing is out-of-date before it even hits the newstands... Bookshelves... Case in point this was published in September of last year, all of the 2013 Batman sets aren't even referenced in this book, most likely because they weren't close enough to final products when this started printing. This also explains why the Mini-Figure list at the end of the book is missing the 2012 Comic-Con Exclusives Shazam, Bizzaro and so on and so forth. (Strangely enough though the 2011 Comic-Con Mini-Figures are also missing from those pages, despite being mentioned in this very book earlier on. (At least Green Lantern and TDK Batman I think there was also a Superman in 2011 as an early preview exclusive which isn't mentioned either.)</p>
<p>The presentation however is well worth the price of admission, especially on Amazon which always have great sales. Much like previous Visual Dictionaries there is a lot of material to cover, and for the most part it does get covered adequately enough. With sites like Brickset and Bricklink there's probably some mistakes with Set info or something, as there can be at times in these books a few odd editorial misses. (One example being that they list more than 250 Gold Bricks in LEGO Batman 2 when that is not the case, it's only 250.)</p>
<p>Let's face it though, if DK didn't include exclusive Mini-Figures a lot of AFOLs would just skip these books, because they get all their information from sites like Brickset and Bricklink. Although there are a few interviews in the book with the LEGO design team and the TT Game Team that are interesting, if short reads.</p>
<p>The pictures of the sets are nice and crisp though, and there are indeed a lot of useful tidbits for children to enjoy. AFOLs will find this a quick read, and they'll probably be screaming at all the little details they know more on than the team behind the book, but let's be fair here this is a publication that needs to meet a publishing date. There is only so much information and so much time to process this information before the book must be out for the masses to buy. Mistakes are not only to be expected, but they should be forgiven. Especially with the internet offering up so much information, some of it perhaps not 100% factual in regards to existing LEGO sets in the Batman and DC Super Heroes Themes.</p>
<p>These books are still a great addition to an AFOLs collection, not just because of the Mini-Figure, but because of how much fun it is just flipping through the pages and learning a bit more about the world of LEGO from an insiders perspective. There's also another flip-style image in the corners of each page. One side The Joker, the other Batman, these flip books are kind of tricky to get to work right, but they are a neat aside for the kids.</p>
<p>As for the Mini-Figure, in spite of this being another Chinese made figure it is superbly detailed and brilliantly concieved. Instead of just giving us yet another (Harry Potter/Luke Skywalker/Han Solo) the folks at DC and LEGO have conspired to present an actual unique Mini-Figure from the LEGO Batman Video Game universe. And while it isn't a Batgirl, Killer Moth, Mad Hatter or Clayface, it is one of the unique suits Batman wears. Electro Suit Batman has an impressive print, he's got double-sided torso, leg printing and even printing on the arms and cowl to match the look seen in the game. The only element absent from this figure is the backpack, which most skilled AFOLs will more than likely try and MOC to make the Figure that more acurate.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a great addition to the DC Super Heroes and Batman Theme, I just hope that if they do another run later on during the Theme's lifespan they don't just re-print verbatim what is found inside. And while the information is incomplete, it's still worth it. I hope LEGO will offer up further Mini-Figures inspired by the video games in future sets, not just exclusives.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,3
