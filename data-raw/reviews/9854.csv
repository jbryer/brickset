"91stlegotrooper","2012-12-17T17:26:15.73Z","You can call it a even fight","I bought this set off of Amazon.com and I am pretty happy with it. The regular clone is more detailed and the clone&nbsp;sergeant&nbsp;looks great. The droidekas are ok. I think they could have been&nbsp;designed better. The command center looks awsome but it does not look like a command center too much. At first I thought it was a speeder. The storage in the back for the blasters and the hidden flick&nbsp;missile in the back of the command center makes it worth it. This is a small set (124 pieces) with a good price (I was able to get it for $12.99).

"DarthZared","2012-12-22T14:21:14.19Z","Unbelievably amazing!","I managed to find this set online prior to its release, just hours before the retailer removed it from the site! This set is a small battle pack, a new variant of pack introduced last year which combines both sides together in one pack (Republic v Separatists etc.)<br><br>The set comes with four minifigures, one Clone Trooper, one Clone Sergeant and two droideka. The clone trooper has an altered helmet and head printing to that on the Clone Wars-style clones, and looks like the figures featured in the 2002 set 7163 Republic Gunship.<br><br>This style of clone is rather rare these days so a re-release is a welcome sight. The next figure is the Clone Sergeant, which is the star of the set. I love the green printing on his helmet and the green arms which make him exclusive to this set. The figure is a great addition to any collection due to it's great printing and overall good looks.<br><br>Droideka have always been rather too big and bulky for my liking in the past, and I am extremely glad to see that they have been minifigure-scaled in this set. They are still easily identifiable and posable, so they are awesome for battle scenes!<br><br>The main model of the set is the airspeeder, which is rather creative of Lego. The parts in the speeder are incredibly rare - probably half of the parts used I have not seen before in over 100 sets I own!<br><br>The speeder has a very creative design, and I love the missile launcher at the back. There are two holders for the clone's blasters at the back, and I decided to modify it to hold the sergeant's macrobinoculars!<br><br>In conclusion, this is an amazing little set with bags of playability and unusual, rare parts and figures. It is a great set and I only hope that the rest of the 2013 sets are as good as it!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"hjmediastudios","2013-01-14T09:40:37.953Z","A great parts pack with great minifigs","<p>I just picked up 12 of these beauties at local stores, and I must say, I'm very impressed with the overall quality and playability of the set. Where it really shines, however, is the excellent minifig selection and the superb re-usability of the pieces in the set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The clones are spot-on- they really look like their Episode II counterparts, and far outshine the garishly ugly Clone Wars variety of trooper<br></li><li>The minifig-scaled droidekas are pretty nice; they have decent posability while remaining easily identifiable as droidekas.<br></li><li>The command center is all right. Despite its flaws, it's good-sized for a battle pack and offers some actual play value.</li><li>No stickers, and we even get a useful 2x2 slope control panel.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The flick missile on the command center can't really be fired.<br></li><li>The clones' faces have a bizarre look on them. The closest expression I've ever made is one of shocked disgust, as in ""you ate <i>what</i>?"" Their head's aren't reversible, so you get an entire army whose main emotion is one of disturbed surprise.<br></li><li>The droidekas aren't 100% great- their underside domes would have been better in brown or bronze, and their legs seem a bit larger than is strictly necessary.</li><li>Do we really need a clone sergeant? He's well done, but including only one generic trooper in the set makes it a little hard to army-build. I predict a glut of sergeants on Bricklink in the near future.<br></li></ul><p>There's one big aspect of the set that I like- the parts factor. We get a lot of useful and rather rare parts from the droidekas and command center, including some nice curved pieces from the command center, one of the new 2x2 inverted-tile pieces, and a printed console. From the droidekas, we get a nice helping of fire-hose/gun pieces, some pneumatic T pieces, and a host of little fiddly bits that are great for the sci-fi/mecha MOC enthusiast.</p><p>Overall, I'd highly recommend this set. If you're a Star Wars fan, you can get a nice little battle in a box with mediocre army-building potential, and if you're not, it's always great for some nice parts.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5

This was the first set that caught my eye, and I hoped for an episode 2 set. While everyone said I was wrong, I proved them wrong. Enough story time, onto the set.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said above, this was the most anticipated set for me. I could hardly wait as I entered the Lego store, only to find out, they lasted a strong 2 seconds. 1 month later, I found this set at Target and I bought it as soon as possible. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Command Center- Ok, who actually bought this set for the command center? It was WAY too small. I also dont think we need a flick fire missle. However, the parts did make a nice droid factory. 6/10</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Droidekas- I must say, I'm impressed. We have gotten many bad Droideka models over the years. While most people when saying they have to choose the best droideka, they point to the MTT. I, however, disagree. They were very well constructed, and perfect for army builders. 9/10</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Clone troopers- As it is obvious, Lego said f*** it to the army builders, and made cheap battle scenes. I do think this would be not bad as an army builder. The clones are just the Clone Wars ones, but much better printing. The sargent is perfect. You can tell Lego did some major work on him. 10/10</p><p>Rounded: 4/5 While not perfect, this still is a must have set.</p>

"legolover2001","2013-07-25T15:42:48.067Z","75000: Clone Troopers Vs. Droidekas","<p>As soon as I saw this set I knew I had to have it, mainly because of the Droidekas and a NORMAL CLONE! You never see normal Clones any more (Ok, there are four of these in 2013)! The command station looks quite ugly though which let's down the set a bit. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The front of the box is quite interesting. It seems to take place at the First Battle Of Geonosis with the Droidekas firing at the troopers and the station but the clones are firing the complete wrong way. The back of the box has the Droidekas firing the wrong way this time and the clones the right. It also shows the station getting ready to fire the secret missile and a front and side picture of the Droideka and both Droidekas firing. The instructions have the same picture on the front of the box. They are very easy to follow. At the end there is a picture of Yoda with a Holocron&nbsp; with a code which might be a teaser of the new Yoda Chronicles coming up and a picture of some of the new minifigures including the much loved Rancor.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>Lot's of interesting parts in this set, dark red pieces, come stuff and the 3 side with studs piece in the Droidekas head.
<h4>Minifigures</h4>CLONE TROOPER: The legs are very disappointing as they are just plain white and black, the torso is also quite nice with a two lines two show the rank and the back of it has a backpack of some description, the head is new for the clone trooper, he's bearing his teeth with large eyebrows plus some lines for added affect and the helmet the seen before 'T' shaped line with grills and a regular gun. CLONE SARGENT: The legs are the same as the clone trooper, why no printing on them Lego? The torso however, is not the same. It has veeery tiny differences on the belt, four dots on the breastplate for other troops to recognise the rank and sand green arms. The head is also the same as the clone trooper and and helmet is almost the same but with green lines straight down and around the eye-holes and has again a normal gun and a pair of electrobinoculars. DROIDEKAS: The legs (or claw)are different shades of chrome made of small teeth and robot arm parts, the body is made out of brown and dark blueish gray parts, the guns are made out of fire hose nozzles and binoculars while the head and neck are made out of droid arms and levers and a brown slope and other pieces including a transparent red bulb for a cool looking eye. Nice. <br><h4>The build</h4><p>The only interesting bits about the building is building the Droidekas and the missile launcher on the station.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is quite nice, even with the ugly commander station. It has quite a few dark red parts which I always love and a sloped front, it has a drivers (if it is a mobile station, I don't know) seat with a printed slope, it has on the side two flag pieces which I think might be doors of wings and my favourite bit, the missile launcher. All you have to do is lift it over and a blue missile can be seen to flick. I don't know why I love seeing the 'flickers' when they are in a ton of sets but I always do, it's a habit I suppose.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Altogether, it is a rather good set and helpful if you are building an army for both sides. It has hours of playability, awesome figures and it looks good on my display and it might on yours! For just £11.99/$12.99 it's a bargain for the figures so I highly recommend it if you see it in the shops!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

When I got it, I was a little disappointed. The set was simply a miniaturized version of the command center in Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones that Yoda is taken to.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The set provides with another part of the Clone Wars: the command center. No war can succeed without somewhere for the leaders to take command from a safe distance. By adding this set to your fleet, you can have Yoda sit back as the Clone Army moves in against the Droid Army.</li>
	<li>The clone troopers are amazing, especially the ARC trooper. I&#39;m really impressed with the shiny silver visor, as well as the green markings. A good addition to the Republic Army.</li>

	<li>I was really disappointed with the droidekas. It is no where near similar to the ones in the movie, with short, straight arms, fat body, and a great big eye. Honestly, they look part scorpion, part Cyclops, and part goblin.</li>
	<li>Though the command center is a good addition to the fleet of vehicles, it has one flaw: the command center has been shrunk down so far, it could go with the microfighters (not saying the microfighters are bad, just that this set is too small). This brings down the playability, because you can&#39;t have as many clones stationed there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether, the set is decent. Personally, the only reason I would get any more would be for the clones. The droids and speeder just weren&#39;t enough to completely satisfy this set for me.</p>

"PooPotato","2014-04-05T03:44:52.23Z","Attack of the Clones!","<p>Mysteriously during my childhood I received&nbsp;an original Phase I clone, although I never purchased the 7153 Republic Gunship or 4482 AT-TE. &nbsp;This trooper stood apart from my others, especially because The Battle of Geonosis was my absolute favorite Star Wars ground battle at the time (Hoth is now in 1st place, Empire Strikes Back FTW). &nbsp;So I patiently waited for new Phase I clones, and was slightly disappointed in the &#39;Clone Wars&#39; show style, as it wasn&#39;t film accurate. &nbsp;So after patiently waiting 12 years, this battlepack came out, and I was extremely interested in picking a couple up. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box was a different size than most other battlepacks. &nbsp;It was stubby, and didn&#39;t take up too much shelf space.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The amount of parts for this set is quite impressive at 124. &nbsp;You could use the pieces included for the command center to put towards a larger scaled version if you bought enough of these.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures are the reason you buy any battlepack, so I will describe them in more detail.</p>

<p>The Clone Trooper Sergeant is the gem of this set, and looks absolutely wonderful next to the Clone Trooper Lieutenant and Commander (I have yet to receive the Captain). &nbsp;He has olive colored arms, 4 olive dots on his chest plate denoting his rank, and olive highlights on his helmet with a silver colored visor. &nbsp;Although this minifig looks great, I am a little annoyed by the fact that an army of Phase I clones will consist of half infantrymen and half sergeants, which is terribly disproportionate in military terms. &nbsp;As I mentioned in my review of 75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid, the Sergeant would have worked out a lot better if it was included in that set, and we instead got two normal privates in this set. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The Clone Trooper Private is a standard infantryman, and looks very good standing next to the Sergeant and the other Clone Officers. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t come with his DC-15A in this set, but comes with the shorter carbine variant DC-15S. &nbsp;It is a little disappointing that both troopers don&#39;t have leg printing, but it&#39;s not too big of an issue.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The two Droidekas are the first ones I&#39;ve added to my collection since 2002, so naturally they are an improvement. &nbsp;It is possible to roll them into their ball form, and they are scaled much better than in all previous versions. &nbsp;Like I have mentioned in my other reviews, I think that Geonosian&nbsp;Battle Droids would have looked much better in this set, as having an army of those would be much better than an army of Droidekas.</span></p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The building of the Command Center was very interesting, and didn&#39;t have one dull moment in it. &nbsp;The building of the Droidekas on the other hand was very repetitive and time consuming, and wasn&#39;t exciting in any way.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The Command Center looks like the one in the film, although that one was much wider. &nbsp;The two ramps on the side (which are used for disembarking passengers from a Republic Gunship cargo bay) match up with the cargo bay on the 7676 Republic Gunship, so I imagine that they would work with the 75021 version as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>The amount of pieces in this set is very good, and the minifigs are must-haves. &nbsp;The model could use a little work to be film accurate, but purchasing another one could easily give you enough pieces to accomplish that.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Awesome minifigs</p>

<p>Decent mini-model</p>

<p>New Droideka design</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Droideka build very tedious</p>

<p>$13 is still a little too expensive for my taste.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:42:32.653Z","More Troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic","<p><strong>Set #75000 Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas:</strong> 2013 saw some pretty interesting sets, the battle packs from that year were fun too, however I think the Republic Troopers vs. Sith Troopers was a better army builder compared to this one. You might want one of these sets, for the Clone Sergeant, but buying multiples might not be worth it. If only because how many Sergeants does one collector need?</p>

<p>Still this is a nifty set and I&rsquo;m going to tell you why you should buy at least one of them if you&rsquo;re a fan of Clones, the Prequel Trilogy and Droidekas.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>With a battle pack there isn&rsquo;t much to be said here. The box is the Yoda design from 2013, which wasn&rsquo;t bad honestly. I liked the look of this box over the blander designs from past years battle packs. (Like the Snowtrooper and Echo Base Trooper packs during the Captain Rex package designs.) The darker colour schemes look better and smarter on the shelf.</p>

<p>The instructions service the set and it&rsquo;s build well. The checklist design in the back of the book is a bit plainer compared to the more recent designs. The cross-promotional images in the back have too few sets shown and too much empty space in my opinion. But we don&rsquo;t want these manuals just for the checklists, and the step-by-step build instructions work well for a set of this size.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Nothing really to say about the parts in this set. They&rsquo;re all pretty standard and not unique, I will say that if you&rsquo;re looking for particular pieces in maroon or grey than this is a decent pack for that. Especially the 1x3 plates.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Only two minifigures in this set, the other two characters are buildable droids.</p>

<p>Phase 1 Clone Trooper: Nothing unique to say about this mini-figure, he&rsquo;s pretty common the past few years and this one doesn&rsquo;t have the new leg printing that LEGO introduced for certain clones. If you&rsquo;ve seen one you&rsquo;ve seen them all. It&rsquo;s nice that he has a regular blaster accessory though.</p>

<p>Phase 1 Clone Trooper Sergeant: With new colouring on the print and green arms the Sergeant is an impressive addition to the ranks of Phase 1 clones that have come before. He&rsquo;s a solid looking fig, the only thing that could make him better would be additional printing on the legs. He includes the blaster and macrobinoculars as accessories.</p>

<p>Droidekas: Both of these are built the exact same way. Their build is a new design, which is somewhat improved from the older build design, it&rsquo;s a bit more accurate in likeness. Unfortunately they still can&rsquo;t turn into decent ball form. I also think the arms are a bit too short, however they are less fragile than the older style first seen in early Phantom Menace sets. Less chance of the connections breaking over time due to the nature of the battle droid arms which are used mostly for connecting everything together.</p>

<p>All in all an ok set of minifigures and buildable characters, not too terribly exciting, but still pretty decent showing for a prequel era battle pack.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The model in this set is a nice stationary command post, as seen on Geonosis during the final scenes of the film. A forward command post that I feel is somewhat accurate to what is seen on screen. Perhaps a slightly bit smaller. The build is quick and not tricky at all.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This command post is a pretty good stationary display set. There really isn&rsquo;t more that it needed, and yet LEGO decided that; hey let&rsquo;s throw in a play feature. Flip the top radar dish/sensor/communication thingy down and presto, one flick-fire missile ready to launch. Straight into the clone sitting in the command seat, yeah I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good defense to blow yourself away from the back of the head. In fact I think it&rsquo;s rather an unfortunate play feature decision&hellip; Personally I would have enlarged the base of the station, put the missiles underneath for a surprise battle droid hitting defensive arsenal.</p>

<p>Might I suggest MOCing something like that with your spare parts and throwing out the official build&rsquo;s placement of the flick-fire missile.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I like this battle pack for what it is, still it took me a while to pick it up just because it wasn&rsquo;t high priority. I&rsquo;d still recommend it, though perhaps not for the reasons you&rsquo;d think, the Droidekas are a real improvement in this set. I like their new build it&rsquo;s a lot more solid and fun compared to the lanky versions I got back in 2001 and I do like the clones. I mean what&rsquo;s not to like, right?</p>

<p>So I recommend this set, however I also recommend that you perhaps MOC the model into a bulkier, better looking command station and remove that awkward placement of the flick-fire missile.</p>

It&#39;s Gabriel here, or, as my username suggests, grsotnas. This is my second review in Brickset. I always appreciate critics and suggestions, to improve them even more! As I&#39;m from Brazil, my English may not be perfect, but I&#39;ll do my best! I look forward to add pictures to this review, so check back in a few days&nbsp;if you want!</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is relatively small, as this is a small set. It has the same size as the other battle packs, and looks very good, depicting a battle scene between the Droidekas and the Clone Troopers. The instructions come in one single small booklet (about 10x15 cm or 4x6 inches).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get 124 parts in this battle pack, which is above average for a set of its kind. Apart from the parts of the minifigs, you get dark bluish gray, light bluish gray and dark red pieces, mostly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>That&#39;s the main reason you buy a battle pack! So, let&#39;s analyze them individually, and after that I will give my overall opinion.</p>

<p>Droidekas: You get 2 of those guys, and in this set, they&#39;re the &quot;bad guys&quot;. Well, I must say that this droidekas look kind of &quot;meh&quot; when you look at them at first. But, as I own the set 7877, which included a amazingly detailed Droideka, these Droidekas look awful. They are too short, far less detailed, and, well, not accurate at all. In a kids perspective, they make a good pair of minifigs, that can be defeated by the Clones, but, in a more T/AFOL, when you want accuracy and functionality, they aren&#39;t very good.</p>

<p>Clone Trooper Seargent: This CT looks amazing, in my opinion. It is the best minifig in this set.&nbsp;The green printing is very nice, and you also get those binoculars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clone Trooper: A regular, common&nbsp;and always welcome regular CT. Great for building your own army!</p>

<p>Overall: In my opinion, LEGO tried to mix the Republic and Separatist &quot;Troopers&quot;. In my opinion, this is not a good idea: if you want to build a Clone Army, with this set, you will also build a awful looking Droidekas army.</p>

<p>I would have preferred more detailed Droidekas, such as the ones from Naboo Starfighter (7877). If the Droidekas were as good as those ones, I wouldn&#39;t mind paying $15 for this set. Or, even better, if this was a Clone Trooper Battle Pack, a great, army builder, awesome and most desired set with only Clone Troopers. For example, the Seargent (that looks just awesome) and 3 Clone Troopers (or 2 CT and a Gunner, for example). If that was the case, I would certainly buy lots of this set to build an army, and I bet many folks out there would do that also.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple, and should take you no longer than 30 minutes. It is most enjoyable, and I wish it lasted longer...&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>You get the 4 minifigures, and a Command Station. The station is much smaller than the one you see in the Ep. II movie, but, for me, that&#39;s just fine. It looks good and features a flick fire missile, which some kids like to play with, but I (and most older Lego fans) dislike. But it is in a very nice mechanism. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a nice set, but the not-so-good Droidekas&nbsp;will make this set a 4/5 for me. You can mod them later, though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the other hand, I really liked the Clone Troopers (especially the exclusive Seargent; but the regular CT is always welcome), and the Command Station looks nice to me. If you want to build a Clone Army (and a Droidekas, why not?), this is a nice set to get, but, if you just want one of the Armies, I would recommend selling the &quot;other part&quot;, and buying other sets other than this one, such as the 75015.</p>

<p>Younger kids will like the playability that the Station features (for a battle pack)</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The inclusion of better&nbsp;Droidekas&nbsp;or more clone troopers would make this set a complete win and a must have, but&nbsp;this is a great set, perhaps not the best army builder (from the Prequels universe), but I do recommend this set to anyone looking for a few more clone troopers, a relatively cheap set, with decent amount of playability.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-06-17T06:50:03.81Z","Clones vs. Droidekas ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 6.2 x 5.6 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.31 pounds. You get a medium/small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. You get two trans red bulbs, two 1x4 brown bow plates, 2x2 white slope brick with a radar printed on it, and a black four sided sign. The maroon parts where nice to get. You get one printed piece (as mentioned above) which is nice and works well with the Forward Command Center (Yes that is what it is called). The total piece count for the set is 124.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clone Trooper:</strong></p>

<p>So you get a Phase I Clone Trooper. You have a white Phase I Helmet with the new/er Clone/Storm Trooper head. The torso has printing on both sides of it. On the front you have the normal white armor with a white belt with two compartments. On the back, again you have the normal white Clone armor with the white belt. He has plain white legs and is armed with a black blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Clone Sergeant:</strong></p>

<p>The Clone Sergeant is also a Phase I Clone. He is exactly the same as the normal Clone Trooper except with green markings (showing his rank of Sergeant). You have a Phase I Clone helmet with green markings. He has the new/er Clone/Storm Trooper head. He has printing on both sides of his torso. He has the same white Clone armor and white belt, but has four dots on his right chest plate (which I believe is a show of his rank). On the back it is the same as the other with normal Clone armor. He has green arms which I like. He has plain white legs and a black blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Droideka:</strong></p>

<p>Each Droideka is brick built with 29 pieces.&nbsp; The Droideka is really nice and (at the time I got it) a nice updated version. It rolls into a ball ok (not great, but much better than Sniper Droideka) It has the traditional 3 legs and the two dual cannon arms. The head has a trans bulb and two antennas to create the head which look nice. The brown colors look and work well in creating this droid.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty simple and easy. It took me under 10 minutes to build. You have two/three builds (depending on whether or not you consider each Droideka as a build).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really nice battle pack. The figures are great. The Clone Trooper and Sergeant are great to get and work well to building a Grand Clone army. The (at the time) updated Droidekas are great. They resemble an actual one really well. The Forward Command Center is much smaller than in the movie (by far). It would have been nice for this command center to have been in a different set, so I could have been larger and more accurate to what it was in the movie. You have a play feature in which the block/box in the back can be bended back, revealing a flick missile. I don&#39;t like this at all (partly because it is completely inaccurate) but also because it is not a great play feature. The command center itself is nice, but I would have liked a larger version of it (May just be me) but the figures and Droidekas are great. I highly recommend getting this to add to your Star Wars collection or to get as an army builder. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-07-04T03:01:42.647Z","Good value for money","<p>This battle pack only comes with two minifigures unlike most. Instead we get two droidekas for the CIS. Although undersized, the small command station looks very movie accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Clone Sergeant: Clone Sergeants lead a squad of nine troopers. Their armour has olive green detail which denotes their rank. I love the phase one clone trooper helmet and the mould looks perfect. The special olive green highlights and silver visor look superb. He has an angry clone expression which is appropriate. The torso looks good with armour and a belt, and the arms are also olive green. Unfortunately the legs are unprinted. He has a blaster and macrobinoculars. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Clone Trooper: The standard trooper included in this set has the same helmet as the sergeant but with a simpler print which still looks nice. He also has an angry clone face. The torso also has a slightly different print without the green highlights. The legs are once again unprinted and this trooper carries the same type of blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Sidebuilds&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Droidekas x2: While it&#39;s very hard to accurately represent the complex shape of a destroyer droid in Lego, these models come very close to being movie accurate. The neck has two points of articulation which allows for some pose-ability. The arms use binocular pieces as blasters to good effect and the claw tipped legs are pose-able.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I like the shape of the command centre. The front is rounded with a communications tower at the top. The colour scheme of dark red and grey looks great. I especially like the curved front; it&#39;s built in two layers, the bottom layer uses standard curved bricks but the top uses dark red arches attached horizontally. There is space for two minifigures in the seats and a small control panel. I like the inclusion of two holsters on the back of the model for the blasters. The control tower can angle back to reveal a hidden flick fire missile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As this is a small set the building experience is not particularly rewarding. The model doesn&rsquo;t have many action features, and the parts are not that interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a small battle pack and is priced accordingly, $23 aud is good value for the set. I like the two clones, especially the sergeant. While the droidekas aren&rsquo;t perfect they are still good inclusions. The command centre looks movie accurate and has a nice colour scheme. I recommend this set if you find it for it&rsquo;s retail price.&nbsp;<br />

"AlkkuV","2022-01-22T18:55:27.337Z","A nice little Battlepack kind of set!","<p>This is my first review, and I&#39;m very excited about it, but let&#39;s&nbsp;get into it. Today&#39;s&nbsp;review is set number: 75000 Clone Troopers VS Droidekas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box And Instructions: Box art was this sort of Geonosis background and the manual/instructions were easy to follow. The instructions have 31 pages in total. In the end of the instructions there is some kind of&nbsp;code to a Lego Star Wars game, but It&#39;s&nbsp;probably so old that it doesnt&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with 2 minifigures, but I&#39;m not sure do the Droidekas count as minifigures, well you decide. The minifigures for the separatists are of course the two Droidekas. They have two laser cannon on each side of them. The Rebublic minifigures are very good in this set. First, just a basic phase 1 Clone Trooper, but then the star of the show a Phase 1 Clone Sergeant. It&#39;s unique to this set and the green print on it looks pretty nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There is some nice parts in this set for $12. The red parts in the command centre are pretty nice and the binoculars for the Clone Sergeant are good as well. But almost all the parts for the Droidekas are very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete build: The overall set is very good for quite a low price. The Droidekas are quite rare, and the Clone Sergeant is unique. The command centre could have had more details, but it&#39;s&nbsp;okay. Overall I would give this set a 4/5.</p>
