"tkettle9719","2013-01-19T13:22:02.757Z","The Ultimate Old Republic Minifig Ensemble","<p>I got this set in my most recent shop.lego.com order so as to get the minifigs (the speeder is pretty cool, too, but the minifigs seemed to be the stars of the set). What I got was what I was expecting; the minifigs here are amazing. I love them to pieces due to their superb detailing and their weapon variance. However, the speeder came as a sort of surprise to me. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigs here are some of the best that Lego has ever produced; they look almost exactly like their source material. <br></li><li>The variance of weapons here is awesome; no two weapons are the same here, especially that large blaster that the Republic trooper has (my favorite part of the set). <br></li><li>I also really like the speeder; it looks like an excellent rendition of the Rendili speeder (I think), and it fits the Sith Trooper as a weapon. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I find the price per piece ratio a bit too much here; 20 cents is expensive here, even with the two round pieces that make up the speeder. <br></li><li>I also wish that the two Republic troopers had a bit more variation; maybe a general or vanguard would work really well here to even the odds out. <br></li><li>Also, I wish there was a bit of a raiser for the Sith trooper to stand on while in the speeder; it doesn't look very easy for him to look out of. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a great battle pack to look at; it has everything it should. Great minifigs, great weapons, and great playability make this the battle pack to get. However, the price per piece is a huge letdown for me. If you buy this (which I highly recommend you do), don't get it at full price (unless you are a huge fan of the Old Republic game), but wait until it's about 25 percent off; A BOGO half off sale would be ideal. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"David1971","2013-01-19T18:26:58.473Z","Amazing minifigs and superb 1930s Star Wars vibe","So we're back in what I call the 1930s, Art Deco era of Star Wars, which is officially ""Star Wars: The Old Republic"". I've not played this game but I certainly like the design. When I reviewed set #9497, the Republic Striker-class Starfighter from this series (see <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=44512"">http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=44512</a>), I wrote about how I really love the design here, which cleverly looks like it's from a few decades prior to the Star Wars movies we know and love. (I also noted that it's therefore weird that these designs are supposedly from ""3,500 years"" before that period ... but never mind).<div><br></div><div>The minifigs are just lovely. The Sith troopers (that's the red and the black ones) are stylish, and a bit weird in a good way; and the Republic troopers (white) are really stylish, mostly because of the brilliant helmet design -- again, very 1930s/Art Deco-ey.</div><div><br></div><div>The little ship thing is not much more than a fancy flying chair, but it's quite good, nicely done, and maybe a bit better than you might expect (if you're a pessimist about the little thingy that you typically get with four minifigs in these 'battle packs'). Actually it's not a flying chair, is it, because it doesn't offer the luxury of sitting down. It's a flying platform, with two of the inevitable 'flick-fire missiles', and some nice curves.</div><div><br></div><div>So all in all, a nice little set. It's not <i>amazing </i>value for money, but followers of Lego Star Wars have probably got used to that by now. At least it's more cool and stylish than you could ever reasonably expect.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

I was amazed by the Clone Trooper battle pack and it's amazing Minifigures. I, unfortunately, ignored this set. I picked it up at a Target, got home, and built it. The first thing that popped out was the fantastic Minifigures. They were very detailed and had nice molded headgear. Then, I built the speeder. Once I saw the product as a whole, I looked at it and said, ""Wow, that speeder sucks"". I took it apart and made a nice Artillery cannon out of it. It could be considered cheating to rate it as part of the set, but where is the fun in that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Robust Minifigures</li><li>Decent amount of rare parts</li><li>Makes a nice cannon</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The speeder sucks</li><li>A bit pricey</li></ul>
<p>If you buy this set for Minifigures and parts, you will find it to be worth every last cent. If you buy it for a MOC, I would only buy 1. While many people may not care about the price, think about it. 6 years ago, we were paying 10 dollars for 4 Battle droids, 3 Super Battle Droids, a STAP, and a nice carrier. I think Lego is going the wrong way with these battle packs, but, as a Lego fan, I will continue to buy their products. Hopefully, things will resume normally next year.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,3

The build takes around 10 minutes to complete which is a rather quick and simple one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are four figures in the set, two Republic troopers and two Sith Troopers.</div><div><br></div><div>The republic troopers feature new curved helmet pieces, which have a similar shape to the rebel troopers helmet from episode four except fully enclosed. This features orange printing on the top, silver side printing and black visor printing which is curved at the top. The head of the figure features a serious face as if in the middle of a battle.</div><div><br></div><div>The torso features central orange printing, a belt at the bottom and additional black and grey printing too. The back includes a backpack printing and additional grey back printing too. Both Republic troopers are identical, where one includes a long rifle gun whilst the other includes a medium sized gun, which is made of a few pieces which looks okay but could do with a bit more detail at the front.</div><div><br></div><div>The two Sith troopers are different from each other, unlike the republic troopers. The first figure features a dark black helmet with silver and red printing, which is the same mould as the ones in the Fury Class Interceptor and a similar moulding to Darth Vadars. There are silver, red and green chest printings on the torso which are presumably for armour and breathing on the figure whilst further silver printings are on the back of the figure. The legs feature silver patterns and red spots included there as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second Sith trooper features a similar &nbsp;helmet piece except the red line at the top and noticeably thinner &nbsp;and there's more silver work on the front of it too. Both figures feature somewhat happy facial expressions which is surprising consider they're in major conflict in this set, but that's just a minor flaw (maybe they're winning).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The front if the torso if the 2nd figure features dark red printing with black and silver printings also reflecting a breathing device whilst the back includes silver and black prints with the egs including black and silver which is probably armour added to the figure's appearance.

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-05T18:22:16.97Z","Old Republic Era","<p><strong>Set #75001 Republic Troopers vs. Sith Troopers: </strong>A brilliant Battle Pack from 2013 with a lot of value for fans of the Old Republic era of Star Wars. Even if you aren't these are some great Mini-Figures to collect and army build.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheap way to build a small army of Sith Troopers and Old Republic Troopers. 
<li>The Sith Troopers are a pair of really great Mini-Figures, I love their print and the fact that they look like a small army of private troopers for Darth Vader (If you want to), they look great with double-sided torsos and printed helmets. 
<li>The Republic Troopers are also a pair of awesome looking Mini-Figures, I enjoy the blending done in the sculpt of the helmets which make them look like a combination of Clone/Stormtrooper Helmets and the fancy helmets/hat pieces worn by Rebel Troopers. The fact that they have double-sided torsos and leg printing is just icing on the cake. 
<li>The weapons in this set are all fun parts, the stand out is the buildable blaster cannon wielded by one of the Republic Troopers. 
<li>The miniature vehicle that the Sith Trooper uses to attack is a fun little build that works as a sort of early version of a STAP combined with an attack craft of some sorts. I really like the build.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stickers are used instead of printing for details on the Sith vehicle. 
<li>The Flick-Fire Missiles are a good play feature, but I'd prefer it if they were built into the underside of the vehicle. 
<li>The vehicle is a bit short where the flight controls are located, you can't actually get it to look like the picture on the box while the Sith Trooper is flying it. It's a bit awkward in this area of the build and needs a bit of modifying to get it to work better for the pilot.</li></ul>
<p>I'm really impressed with this Battle Pack from 2013 and even though I might be shunned for this I like this a lot better than the Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas (which I'm aiming to pick up sometime soon). Despite&nbsp;a few cons this set really stands out to me because it's so unique and different from most anything else familiar in the LEGO Star Wars universe, I really love the new Republic Trooper helmet, and the Sith Troopers are just straight out fun looking. With a name like Sith Trooper though I kind of half expect them to all be using lightsabers.</p>

"aredotam","2013-09-19T21:49:35.927Z","Enjoyable add-on set to the Star Wars theme","<p>The Republic Troopers vs. Sith Troopers set is a nice supplement to other Star Wars Old Republic Lego sets.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Accurate details - At first glance these Republic and Sith troopers might seem strange, especially in the helmet designs. However they are extremely accurate replicas of characters from the online video game Star Wars the Old Republic.</li><li>One of the Republic troopers wields a special heavy blaster cannon that actually needs assembly. In my opinion the blaster looks nice and adds a nice extra building experience.</li></ul><div><b>Cons</b></div><div><br></div>
<ul><li>Sith speeder - This element isn't very pleasing to the eye, and doesn't add anything positive to the building experience. The flick-missiles don't make the speeder any more interesting and can be awkward to use. Also, it can be difficult to get one of the Sith troopers to stay put on the vehicle.</li><li>Sith trooper weapons - The blasters carried by the Sith troopers don't measure up to those used by the Republic troopers, due to the fact that the Sith trooper who pilots the speeder is only equipped with a small blaster.</li></ul><div>Overall, I enjoyed this set. Like all Star Wars Lego sets it's a bit overpriced, but at $13 it's one of the cheapest sets. The Republic and Sith troopers make a nice addition to any collection, especially if combined with the other Old Republic Star Wars sets.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"VaderFan2187","2016-10-27T05:26:02.923Z","A Set of Two Halves","<p>I received this set for my birthday in 2013, and I must say it is a great battle pack. Not perfect, but quite good.</p>

<h3>Box&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Typical Battle Pack style and size. It shows the troopers fighting in unusually close combat. The box shows off the play feature: two flick missiles. This looks slightly laughable on the box itself and perhaps could be removed, but for new fans I guess it is informative.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Woefully brief. At 63 pieces, there&#39;s not much to expect. A sizeable portion of the set is made up of two dark stone grey corner round pieces, smaller versions of those on Anakin&#39;s airspeeder in 2012. Being relatively new to lego back then, the stickers (cough cough) were hard to align on the slopes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too special, minifigs aside. The corner round slope pieces are ok, but nothing else that is noteworthy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>About time I head into the very best part of this set that sets it apart from some others: the figures. I don&#39;t play The Old Republic, but to me the figs are suitably generic yet suitably detailed. I&#39;ll dive into them one by one:</p>

<p>Sith Trooper (mostly black) nice figure, similar to those in the Sith interceptor, just with printed legs (yay!)</p>

<p>Sith Trooper (black and red) another good figure, brand new and exclusive, but I prefer the other one because of the colors. Its personal opinion though.</p>

<p>Republic Troopers: Good figures, decent detailing. One has a blaster rifle, the other a large brick-built heavy gun. They have different heads.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Horrible. This set has terrible value, sitting at a mere 63 pieces at the usual BP price. The final model is small too.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Decent set thanks to the minifigs. Get it for the figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a small battle pack box. It has a small instruction booklet with easy to follow steps.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>Battle packs always have at least half decent minifigures&nbsp;and this one is no exception. The first character has a white and orange helmet that comes down at the front. His head is a smiling face. The torso shows white armour with an orange stripe down the middle. His legs are plated armour with some orange. The weapon is a rifle. The second minifig&nbsp;is exactly the same except from his head, which curls up into a small smile, and his weapon. He is equipped with as buildable machine gun composed of binoculars and two short blaster pistols. The third is a Sith Trooper. The helmet is red and black and forms a snout at the front, with the sith logo above it. His torso is mainly red with a belt. His head is frustrated. The legs are also red. He has a blaster. The fourth minifig&nbsp;is the same except in black armour. He has a pistol.</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the pieces are grey or red. There are two stickers</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>It takes between 2-5 minutes to build. The stickers add minor detail.</p>

<p>Completed model</p>

<p>There are two push-out missiles on the hover speeder thing. The handlebars can be adjusted. There is a holster on the bar for a guy who&#39;s driving it. It would&#39;ve been nice to see a build for the Republic, since the hover speeder is all you get.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Sith troopers</p>

<p>-Republic troopers</p>

<p>-Nice buildable machine gun.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Both minifigures on each side are pretty much identical</p>

<p>-Poor stickers</p>

<p>-No Republic build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Box art was nice, not sure what planet it&#39;s&nbsp;from, though. Instruction were clear and easy to follow. They had 19 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: There are four minifigures in this set and three of them are unique to this set. First the Republic minifigures: Republic Trooper and Republic Trooper (Cheek Lines). Then the bad guys: Sith Trooper - Black Outfit, Printed Legs and Sith Trooper - Dark Red Outfit. Every single one is unique, but the&nbsp;Sith Trooper - Black Outfit, Printed Legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: The set contains 63 pieces. Not that many rare ones, but the Circle 90G 6x6 Roof Tile is good. Some good red pieces, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: I don&#39;t remember the build of this set that well, but it&#39;s pretty simple, just build the minifigs, the machine-gun, and the speeder. The speeder has flick-fire missiles and a couple of stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall this set is not worth $13. Four minifigs that are great and then a speeder that is good. The playability of this set is good, but everything else is not that good. Overall I would give this set a 3.5/5. Thanks for reading, and stay toon for more reviews!</p>
