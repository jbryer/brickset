"91stlegotrooper","2012-12-17T17:44:17.19Z","Better than the first two.","<p>There have been three AT-RT released. One in 2005 and was called ""Clone Scout Walker"", one in 2010 with the Clone Turbo Tank, and now this one. It's price is $19.99 (or at least that is what I bought it for on Amazon.com) and has 222 pieces. The AT-RT is very detailed and looks almost exactly like the AT-RTs in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars cartoon. It even includes a place to put the clone's blaster and includes the 501st markings. The sniper droid looks&nbsp;excellent&nbsp; and was a nice addition to this set. The Yoda has a new look that gives him more detail. The 501st Legion clone trooper in phase II armor looks great. The commando droid commander is perfect and now can command the commando droids that come in two other sets (9488 and 75012). This set is worth the price and I have no regrets.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"donutsftw","2013-01-08T21:36:36.46Z","Not bad as a parts pack, but otherwise sort of boring","<p>We've seen other versions of the AT-RT before, but at least this remake mixes it up by being in a color pattern we haven't gotten before.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box style is done in the same style as the other 2013 Star Wars sets, and like most newer sets this size, the box is of the smaller, studier type and sealed with tape, so it's easier to open without damaging. Of course, the smaller size means the parts are packed in tighter, which resulted in my instruction booklet getting folded over, although the sticker sheet was fine. At least these stickers are the clear variety and are all small.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>For the RRP, this set isn't too bad, since it manages to be below 10 cents a part. There's a decent area of parts in it as well: There's 6 2x2 blue ""satellite dishes"", which are fairly uncommon as far as I know, as are the 2 1x4 curved parts that make up the droideka's shell, and the modified flag/flap pieces and 1x3 tiles in the armor. The octagonal piece that the droideka's legs connect to is done in pearl silver, just like the ones in 75000 (as far as I can tell at least, I haven't picked 75000 up yet).<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Although Brickset lists the sniper droideka as a minifig, I don't know if I'd group it as such (especially since it's not listed as one on the box). Regardless, it's pretty cool; not only is it a variant we haven't gotten before, but it's got lots of good parts for small scale spaceship/mecha building, and it's probably the best official droideka I've seen in terms of capturing the round shell they have. The other minifigs, aside from the 501st clone trooper (which also appears in 75004 Z-95 Headhunter), are all currently unique to this set, although I wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp; we see this version of Yoda and the commando droid again somewhere down the line. While technically unique, the commando droid doesn't seem all that special to me, the only thing that differs from previous commando droids is the printing on the head piece. As for the trooper, at this point I think Lego's released more clone troopers with special colorings/markings than plain troopers, and while this one certainly isn't bad, it doesn't stand out against some of the other variants released.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is broken up into three bags. It hardly seems necessary for a set this size, but whatever...</p><p>Bag 1 builds the droideka and the minifigs, bag 2 builds the legs and hip assembly, and bag 3 builds the cockpit. Even if you disregard the numbering on the bags, it's a pretty quick build, with no surprises if you're an experienced builder. Younger builders may take a bit longer, but even then I can't see it being very challenging.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As I said, the sniper droideka is great, and I liked the blue and grey color scheme of the AT-RT. However, it's seriously lacking when it comes to pose-ability. I could already tell this from the pictures, but still: The cockpit can't swivel independently on the hips, only the gun can. The pieces on the legs really limit the range of motion of the joints there, which is made even more noticeable since the legs use click-hinges and already have very few possible positions. The ""dynamic""/walking pose on the box? Yeah, it can't actually stand up in that pose, or virtually any other, so your display options are kind of limited.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Since I mainly got this set for parts, I'm pretty happy with it, but if you're getting this set as a gift for a kid, you'd probably be better served getting something like the 75003 A-wing Starfighter, which is at least swoosh-able.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3
"sf1378","2013-02-04T17:24:42.13Z","Good for display but woefully un posable.","I got mine earlier today from John Lewis for £19.95. Other reviews have been very well detailed giving you a lot of ins and outs so I won't repeat whats been elaborated on before.<div><br></div><div>I'll admit, if its a walker I like it in Star War's related Lego. However, I feel the build's fundamentally flawed - the legs need to be more posable and the plates hinder this at the clickable joints. I am sure some MOC modding and repositioning of pieces may improve this, but I can't be bothered in sourcing more parts atm...</div><div><br></div><div>Secondly, the cockpit needs a swivel plate perhaps and the thighs really needed to be independently posable of each other instead of static as they are.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Its also a shame theres nowhere to place old Yoda to ride on it along with the trooper...Its also about time Lego makes the legs on the Droid Commando's, Super Destroyer Droids and Battle Droids independently posable as well.</div><div><br></div><div>I noticed that this set is £2 more than the 2013 Lego City Cement truck, Petrol Tanker and Fire Engine, I equate this 'premium' simply because its a licensed Lego product.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it is nice but its not really value for money and playability. Its more of a display piece. The smaller baggie style Clone Walker and the Clone Battle Pack that had a 2 seater walker both were much more posable than this one and could easily be displayed in a 'walking pose'...</div><div><br></div><div>However, you do get 3, or 4 if you count the Droideka 'sniper' figures as well - I've never owned a Yoda before so thats nice nor a new style Clone with the ROTS style 'phase 3' helmet.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,2
"Blockland","2013-04-01T21:34:38.83Z","Alright","<p>Entering the 2013 line was a huge feat for me, as I did not buy many sets that have recently come out. While I am pleased with sets, such as the TOR sets, sets like the battle packs have been degraded. This set looked to be alright, and that is just what it is, alright. The parts you get are quite nice, however, the building experience practically abuses these parts. I must say, the final design is quite big for an AT-RT. Also, the one in 2005 was about 10 dollars, and it fitted perfect with an army. This just stands out. Now, onto the Minifigures. The Commando Droid is still nice, and I like on how simple, yet effective his design is. This is were we get into some serious ****. The clone is by far the worst to date. Why Lego, why not just make a blue version of the original Episode 3 clone. Yoda is ok, but, where is his wood necklace thing. The sniper droid is ok at best. The AT-RT is ok, but could use a better size. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good price and pieces</li><li>Good Commando Droid</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The other figs are awful</li><li>Too big</li><li>Blue...Really?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite my negative views, it is still a good set, and ok for what it tried to accomplished. If only Lego would realize that sometimes, the old is always better.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,2,4
"twitterz","2013-01-30T17:12:25.063Z","The tale of the almost perfect AT-RT","<p>I really looked forward to get this set from the 2013 wave, and today finally I got my package, along with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9488-1"">9488</a> Battle Pack. I always liked these fast, scout vehicles, and this new version seemed the best, but sadly, this model has its own flaws...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art is really great looking, the AT-RT walker looks good on it (But there's a ""little"" mistake, see the details at the completed model section). The deep blue background is nice, and it enchances the main parts of the set. The Sniper Droid's energy field, and the little battle between Yoda and the Commando Droid are well made, so I haven't got any bad word about the box itself. The instruction is precise, there are no mistakes in it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are one of the best features of this set. You can find many uncommon pieces, like the blue satellite dishes, or the 2x2 brick with groove. All in all the parts are ideal for MOC-ing, the RRP ratio is also good, so this set even worth it just for the lots of blue parts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are the best parts of this set in my opinion. <b><i>Yoda</i></b> is very well made, and perfectly detailed. This version of his headpiece is simply awesome, I really like his white hair and the small details of his face. His torso is double-printed, but I've seen better ones. The only downside is the leg part, which is unadjustable. The <b><i>501st Trooper</i></b> looks cool, his color scheme is perfectly matched with the AT-RT. The helmet is nice and detailed, and it's the most impressive part of this figure. His torso is double-printed too, and it's far better than Yoda's chestpiece. The leg part is also great, it has a detailed blue-gray printing. Overall the Trooper is the best looking minifig in this set. The <b><i>Commando Droid Captain</i></b> is exclusive to this set, but it doesn't look as special as it should. It could have more gadgets with him, or a more detailed printing on the chest. The only difference between the regular Commandos and the Captain is the head piece. The <b><i>Sniper Droid</i></b> is considered as a minfig too, and I'm not sure if I like it or not. It does give a variety to your army, but it's size is a bit big for my taste. I'd be more happier with a regular Destroyer Droid or with a Commando Droid instead of this Sniper one.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build took me about 25-30mins. I had no difficulties with it, the building process was pretty much straightforward, and fast. The only boring part was the leg assembly. Oh and I almost forgot... The infamous stickers... Luckily there were only four of those nasty things, so this wasn't as bad as with some other sets. But some unique printed parts were better than applying the stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model... It could have been much better... The most irritating thing with the completed model is that, you can't turn around the cockpit (but you can adjust the position of the turret, which is unnecessary). This rotating function should be the main part of any walking SW mechs in my opinion, because it really improves the poseability, and the playability of the set. Sadly you can't even put the AT-RT into that position which is showed on the box art. But there's a trick I used, to make this AT-RT look cooler. I removed the cross axle technic part from the hull, and put a turntable 2x2 on the top of the round 2x2 brick. Now you can turn the cockpit, and you are able to make more poses with it, and it won't fall apart. The other downside of the set is the feet area. I think it's too large, and looks awkward when you use the standard positioning of the set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Besides its flaws, this is the most accurate AT-RT I've seen, with some rare parts, and with nicely detailed minifigs. The best part of the model is the cockpit, which looks heavily armored, and well-made at the same time. I mostly recommend this set for Clone Wars fans, and for those, who want some nice SW minifigs in their collection!</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"wii1232","2013-08-02T17:50:23.347Z","Great Minifigures!","<p>I bought this set off of Amazon, and it was a pretty good size.&nbsp; the minifigs were the best, though.&nbsp; I now finally have a Clone Wars Yoda with back printing, as well as a 501st Legion Clone Trooper,&nbsp;a Commando Droid Captain, and a Sniper Droid.&nbsp; The set itself is good, for the right price.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-11-26T16:53:28.03Z","Begun the Yoda Chronicles Have","<p><strong>Set # 75002 AT-RT: </strong>It's 2013, LEGO has introduced the Yoda Chronicles and in the process have cross promoted a bunch of sets and while this set may feature more prominently as part of The Clone Wars it is still a very impressive looking build.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The boxes for 2013 have replaced Darth Maul with Yoda, adopted a much darker green coloring choice, but still maintain the same classic design element we've come to expect from LEGO. It showcases everything you can do with the set and the Mini-Figures quite nicely.</p>
<p>The instructions are great, showing how to build the set in simple to follow steps based on the numbered bag method and features, among other things, a handy checklist of all the 2013 Mini-Figures from the first&nbsp;six sets, an image of what those sets are and a code for the online Yoda Chronicles game (or something like that, it just says to go to LEGO Star Wars.com and input the code for some reason). No protective cardboard for this set, as usual at this price range, so it's a luck of the draw situation if you get mangled, creased, curled or damaged instructions of any kind.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Not too many unique parts in this set if any, although this is the first time in a good half a dozen years that I've picked up a set with the classic Technic Ski Pole element. This was also one of my first times with the new standard of LEGO Lightsaber hilts for Sith and Jedi, not as flashy as the old chromed pieces in silver, but much better than the later 2000s switch to the plain grey colored hilts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Four Mini-Figures in this set, Yoda in his standard Clone Wars appearance looks stunning with the unique molded head and printing, his torso is slightly different from the old 2002 AotC Yoda I already have, not much else to say really he's Yoda and he's in a good half a dozen sets from the Clone Wars alone. Although I do believe this is a more updated head piece, which does look quite stunning.</p>
<p>Commando Droid Captain, it's a droid, the only thing different aside from the colors on this guy from your typical Battle Droid is the unique head. They do capture the look of the character nicely enough, and I am impressed with the print detail on the face, something Battle Droids rarely ever get. So there is that. Still, at the end of the day, you've built one droid, you've built them all.</p>
<p>Sniper Droideka, this is not considered a Mini-Figure by the box as it is a buildable character. It's a character I'm not alltogether familiar with as I don't recall the design from the actual Clone Wars. Still it's a vastly superior build for a Droideka compared to the old 2002 ones I've got, they have their charm, however these new builds are a lot less flimsy looking. Can't wait to pick up the Battle Pack to have standard Droidekas to go with him.</p>
<p>501st Legion Clone Trooper: This is the stand out Mini-Figure from this set. He's got it all, excellent print detailing, wonderful likeness, an awesome helmet design, double-sided torso and even leg printing. If there is only one reason to get this set (aside from the vehicle itself) it's this Mini-Figure.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This model has 3 bags, the first is basically just the Mini-Figures while bag two builds the lower legs of the AT-RT and bag 3 is your cockpit/command seat. Now I own the original Revenge of the Sith AT-RT from 2005, a smaller set, the build in that set wasn't as extensive and the model if memory serves is not as tall as this one.</p>
<p>Each section does have a lot of repeating steps when it comes to the legs, most walkers of the Imperial/Republic era do tend to have similar steps for a lot of the design, however the build is still satisfyingly enjoyable and as you're working on it you get a good sense of where you're going.</p>
<p>There are a few stickers with this set for detail work and markings, the real enjoyable aspect is the colors. The 501st legion coloring for this set is just remarkably effective at being fun to look at and build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Now as I said above I own the RotS 2005 Recon Scout, which is basically an AT-RT and while that model was nice this improved upon model is really great.</p>
<p>It's a taller build overall, the feet are much more involved compared to the original model, the colors really stand out as this version is mostly blue representing the 501st legion. The original build was mostly grey, which isn't bad however still suffers a little.</p>
<p>For the price of this set what you get is really impressive and I'm glad I picked it up.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This set is well worth picking up if you're a fan of The Clone Wars or LEGO Star Wars in general. It offers up an impressively engaging build, the model is a great vehicle and while the inclusion of Yoda makes this a difficult set to troop build with. (As the Yoda Mini-Figure may be harder to sell off on such sites as Bricklink and the like.) It is definitely one I could see buying multiples of during holiday sales.</p>
<p>Strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"jonaye","2014-02-07T14:33:51.41Z","AT-RT","<p>Bought for parts. Model is nice, some good details and minor cons. I&#39;m not a regular CW/TYC watcher, so I can&#39;t vouch for accuracy. To me it&#39;s an fun variation of the AT-ST chicken walker.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nicely detailed box and clear instructions. Moving on.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is why I bought this set. I&#39;m a MOCer and this was on sale which gave a good price/part ratio especially with some of the less common parts. The blue is a nice change from all the gray, black, and rusty red colors that dominated previous SW series.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Droid captain: meh, I guess if you&#39;re a collector you would want this, it barely stands on its own unless you put it on a plate.</p>

<p>Clone trooper: nice details, very different than the Episode 2/3 troopers in my collection.</p>

<p>Yoda: nice printing front and back of the torso. His eyes are a little &quot;googley&quot;. It&#39;s hard imagining that in just 15-20 years this little fellow is going to be on his death bed with Luke Skywalker staring down at him, mouth agape.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This took me maybe 20-30 minutes in front of the TV. Some fun techniques for the cockpit/seat, but nothing groundbreaking. I never had that &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment that many sets give you.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The droideka is necessary as a villain for the set; but is a model, not for action as it doesn&#39;t fold up and roll, limiting playability.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had some limited success posing the model. It&#39;s definitely more sturdy with both legs flat, but then it&#39;s about as interesting and posable as a Barbie&#39;s boyfriend sitting on your shelf. The trick is to get the &quot;toe&quot; on the ground on the leg that&#39;s stepped back, then it&#39;s balanced, but severely susceptible to tipping.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a nice model, naturally better as a display piece rather than an action toy. Good for parts, and that&#39;s why I got it, so I&#39;m happy.</p>

"legofan506","2013-08-14T00:47:07.273Z","Setting the record straight...","<h4>This is my first review so&nbsp;bear with me...</h4>

<p>This is a small set with nice pieces, not really a challenging build but somehow enjoyable. I consider it a good addition to your Star Wars collection and a must have if you are into Clone Wars series (as I am)</p>

<p>I have read some reviews stating complaints/concerns that&nbsp;cockpit can&#39;t swivel independently on the hips and/or pointing out the blue color on the AT-RT...</p>

<p><br />
Allow me to set the record straight:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cockpit it&#39;s not suppose to swivel since that&#39;s exactly how is shown on the TV series (not swiveling!). AT-RT is used extensibly on Republic operations so you can see them in many battles! No swivel...</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Blue? Yes, at least on the episode I just watched S04E11 they are blue... On other episodes they are painted olive green or sand... I guess it all depends on the campaign terrain (or the animators preference).<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No seat for Yoda? Well, if you have seen AT-RT&#39;s in &#39;action&#39; you will certainly understand why is a one operator vehicle.<br />
	Granted, Yoda won&#39;t be leading the troops by foot, most likely there&#39;s a tank of some other transportation nearby to carry Yoda. I have notice that many of the LEGO Star Wars sets (at least Clone Wars inspired) are directly related to scenes on the TV series; therefore, I you haven&#39;t seen the series probably the set scene won&#39;t make that much sense.</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-28T20:37:07.36Z","This is a mostly-good AT-RT. Pity about the sniper droideka","This is LEGO's third AT-RT (Not counting the little AT-RT derived polybagged model, or the two-seat walker from the Clone Walker Battle Pack - that one looks more like a topless AT-PT anyway). The first was the ""Clone Scout Walker"" set from 2005, which is about the same size as this one (Making it larger-than-scale when compared with minifigures, but on the other hand so are all the LEGO speeder bikes). The second was a smaller and simpler version, more in-scale-ish with mini-figures, included as part of the Clone Wars subtheme's Clone Turbo Tank set. This one goes back to the scale and detail of the first, with some tweaks here and there, and is rendered in the livery of the 501st legion.<br><br>The parts are divided into three bags. The first bag has the pieces for the minifigures and for the built-figure sniper droideka. The minifigures are:<br><ul><li>Yoda</li><li>A BX Commando Droid captain</li><li>A 501st Legion Clone Trooper</li></ul>Yoda is the Clone Wars style, as is the trooper, due to this being a set derived from TCW and the Yoda Chronicles. As such, he has cartoony eyes painted onto his head. His torso is printed on both sides, showing his Jedi robes (and even what appears to be a folded-down hood on the back). His lightsaber has a pearl silver hilt, and a translucent bright green blade (the newer, non-neon translucent bright green). His legs are the non-poseable short variety, as expected. It'd be nice if they bent, but making the shorty legs poseable would be tricky to do without blocking the connection area. A very nice figure (my first Yoda, by the way); the only thing I'd maybe want to change is use the lightsaber blade. It's good, but it'd be perfect if the shorter version of the rod/wand piece was used instead.<br><br>The Commando Droid captain is simple, being built the same way as the regular B1 (line soldier) and OOM (Command, security, and pilot) Battle Droids, but it's always good to have another CIS droid. His torso and arms are the same as a regular battle droid, his legs are the same as a Super Battle Droid's, and his head is unique. His head and torso are tampographed to detail him as a captain. He is armed with the basic blaster carbine piece, which has no add-ons (but then, it doesn't need them to look like an E5 or E11 rifle).<br><br>The 501st trooper is a treat. His torso is double-printed, as with any trooper, but with a bit more detail than the original Phase II Armor clones we got in the Episode III sets. His helmet is the new Phase II helmet with the solid, all-tampograph visor. It too is nicely detailed. Heck, this guy's even got kneepads printed on his legs! And of course, his kneepads, torso, and helmet are all decorated with the blue stripes of the 501st. He too is armed with the blaster carbine piece. No add-ons, but still nice.<br><br>The built-figure, the sniper droideka, is a disappointment. It looks alright enough in regular standing mode, and even has the rear armor panels that the regular droideka sets have all omitted, but there's a problem: The shell cannot be positioned to form a front shield for the droid. This is one of the droid's notable features in the show, so the inability to do so hurts the figure.<br><br><br>The other two bags build the walker itself; one builds the legs and the other builds the body. The legs are nicely detailed, taking advantage of some new parts (those sloped grills and certain brackets, in particular) that weren't around back in 2005. They don't stand straight as such, but that's accurate. They also can't fold down for the storage mode, but it's alright. The body uses some new techniques to better capture the overall shape of the front end, though the parts that make said end's surface were all around in 2005 save for the 1x3 tiles. The seat area cleverly makes use of the old classic space seat-with-indentation-for-jetpack piece to give both a nice look and allow the attachment of the bracket plate the antennae are mounted on. Said antennae are made using a flagpole, a cone, a long rod/ski-pole piece, and a Technic two-axle bush/connector, the result looking bang-on and much better than the 2005 set's solitary joystick/antenna piece. The body of the walker doesn't rotate, but as far as I've been able to tell, that's accurate. The front cannon does rotate, however, and so does the nicely-detailed representation here. However, here's where the one disappointment in the design is: The cannon cannot be angled down. Side-to-side, but not down. It should be able to, but it can't. And given the height of the walker, that means that unless the enemy infantry is comprised of Technic (or, assuming any can be found, Homemaker) figures, it's stuck shooting at vehicles. Still, it's overall a very nice walker, and the 501st livery (as seen on AT-RTs in the Umbara episodes) looks good on it.<br><br>In conclusion: Wonderfully-designed set with good minifigs, very good value for money, even with the failings of the sniper droideka. Well worth picking up. 4.5 out of 5. (I know the rating bar says my overall rating is 4 out of 5, but the darn thing doesn't do half units.)<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

"Nuruodo","2015-10-26T20:21:43.943Z","Lethal and accurate walker","<p>I bought this set because it had a great role in The Clone Wars, especially in episodes of Umbara&nbsp;(4th season). It&#39;s just taken from these ones, and it&#39;s very similar to original model. I was really surprised to find it one of the best sets of 2013.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures include a 501st Legion clone, taken from Umbara episodes. It&#39;s very nice because it&#39;s different from Episode III clone troopers. There are also a commando droid, that I love, Yoda, that I obtained with a lot of sets (I think they should have chosen a different Jedi, or maybe an Umbaran instead of him), and a Sniper Droideka, original and taken from Season 4th episodes of Kadavo.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, as I remember. It&#39;s not complicated but I liked it a lot, particularly the build of the cockpit&#39;s base, where the legs are attached. Surely it wasn&#39;t boring.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite sets for it&#39;s appearance. Very similar to original, and not disproportionate&nbsp;in any part. I think they were right when decided to not add any shooter or similar mechanism, because it would have changed in worse the perfect appearance of it. I have to say that feet are really well done, as the anterior part of the cockpit. Legs can move without any difficulty, differently from other Lego walkers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Considering that it only spent for it&nbsp;about 25/30&euro;, it&#39;s surely one of the best 2013 sets. For a little price you&#39;ll get a perfect set, and although it isn&#39;t as big as an AT-AT or an AT-TE it&#39;s very nice to be seen. Also minifigures are nice, perhaps I think Lego could have added an Umbaran or a different Jedi.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; High leg mobility</p>

<p>&ndash; Very similar to original model</p>

<p>&ndash; Low price</p>

"BadBricklord","2017-04-30T02:19:51.84Z","75002 AT-RT","<p>I bought this set on Sunday (4/23/17) for&nbsp;$37 on eBay and I was not disappointed. AT-RT set #75002 officially has&nbsp;two vehicles and 3 mini figs. I was extremely excited to finally have this set, as I love the sniper droideka, the clone wars style Yoda&nbsp;and the 501st trooper. I do have to say one of the main reasons I got this set is because it has so much BLUE!! Blue is my favorite color and this set certainly doesn&#39;t lack in that respect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miscellaneous:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set retailed for $20 but is currently worth around $36&nbsp;(according to brickpicker.com). The set has 222 pieces. A new set has a ppp of $0.09 (retail) and a ppp of&nbsp;$.16 (Current value). It has a 59 page instruction manual with 32 total steps. This is a 2013 set so there are no spring loaded shooters (thankfully). The instructions are pretty clear, though I got a little&nbsp;confused by them because I am an idiot sometimes. One thing that I do appreciate about the set is that there is a little &quot;holster&quot; for the clone trooper to put his blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has three minifigs: 501st&nbsp;Legion trooper, Yoda and a Commando Droid Captain. The 501st trooper print on both sides of the torso, with equal amounts of detail. He has a Phase II helmet with a blue stripe converging on the breath filter. He has the Clone Wars-type face (not &quot;angry Clone&quot;). He cones with a medium sized blaster. He commando droid captain is molded in a dark brown/ maroon color with hire markings on his &quot;face&quot;. He also has a red dot on his chest plate, indicating his rank. He also comes with a medium-sized blaster. Yoga, last but not least, looks awesome. I think that the Clone Wars version of him is better, just because his figure&nbsp;has brighter colors than the non-CW versions. He has the short legs and a green lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AT-RT:&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part about the AT-RT is the blue superstructure. It is finely detailed with the only 4 stickers that come with the set. It has driving controls, a spot to put the blaster, and the antennae mast is superbly constructed. The superstructure has more blue than grey, and the legs vice versa. The chin mounted laser cannon has about 180&deg; degrees of rotation and the barrel is a single piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sniper Droideka:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When most people hear&nbsp;the term &quot;droideka&quot;, they think of a shielded rolling battle droid that has twin rapid fire blaster&nbsp;arms that mow down opponents. Not this one. This is a sniper droideka; it only has one gun and is not shielded. Instead a blaster proof slab of armor covers the vital components while in attack mode. It is built ground-up, and is built upside down. Two yellow 1x1 studs and two grey 1x1 studs stick out of the side. Not sure why they chose yellow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion: 4/5&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set wasn&#39;t the best, as the legs continue to be unable to move from a lack of articulation in the ankle, and that I am a victim of advertising. He minifigs are great, 5/5 for them. Sniper droideka, 4/5 because he&#39;s a little tricky to get standing. AT-RT, 4/5, despite the large amount of blue used didn&#39;t really get the trick done. Good set for collectors and CW fans like me.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-06-14T06:43:23.083Z","Fantastic Set","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small/medium size box. The dimensions of the box are 7.5 x 10.3 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.62 pounds. It comes with a medium size instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. You get a trans red bulb, two 4x2 blue roof tiles, two 1x4x2/3 brown bow plate, and a light grey technic stick. Getting the brown and blue pieces are really nice to get. You get 4 stickers in this set, all of it on&nbsp;the armor of the walker. The total piece count for this set is 222.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yoda:</strong></p>

<p>Yoda is defiantly one of (if not the biggest) draw to this set. Getting him in a set for $20 (USD) is just amazing. He has a rubber head with his green pointy ears. He has white hair on the back of his head which looks great. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a tan jacket over an orangish shirt. On the back you have the hood of the jacket and some wrinkles on the jacket. He has short tan legs and a green lightsaber as his weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>501st Clone Trooper:</strong></p>

<p>The 501st Clone Trooper is amazing. I love getting Clone Troopers from different legions to diversify my Clone army. This Clone Trooper is in the Phase II armor. You have the Phase II helmet with the blue 501st markings on it. He has the old clone trooper head. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have the clone armor with some blue printing on it with blue arms. On the back you have normal clone amor. You have printing of clone armor on the legs with a little blue on it. He is armed with a normal blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Commando Droid Captain:</strong></p>

<p>The Commando Droid Captain is great to get. This is the only appearance of this figure in Lego. The Commando Droid Captain is almost exactly the same as any other Commando Droid. The difference is the white markings on the head (which signifies it as a capitan)&nbsp;which looks great. You have a dark brown droid body with a red dot on the left side of it. You have the dark brown arms and dark brown Super Battle Droid legs. The Commando Droid Captain is armed with a blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me around 20-25 minutes to build. You have two separate builds in this set. You have the Droideka sniper (which took me a few minutes to build) and then the larger, main build; the AT-RT walker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is an amazing set. Getting the 501st AT-RT walker and Clone Trooper is just fantastic. The figures are amazing from Yoda to the Commando Droid Captain. Getting Yoda in such a cheap set is a great deal and you can&#39;t go wrong just with&nbsp;that. The Droideka Sniper is a nice new version of this droid and looks good. The Droideka head is loose and can fall off easily when moving it. I don&#39;t like that it can&#39;t roll into a ball due to the dark grey staff. Overall it looks really nice. The AT-RT is just great. The legs and feet look really good and the blue dishes look great as armor. The top have of the walker looks amazing. The armor on the front looks really good with the blue color. The brick built turret looks fabulous. It rotates 180 degrees and there is a spot behind the driver where you can put the Clone Trooper&#39;s blaster. I highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan/collector. If you aren&#39;t this will still make a great addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-07-02T16:43:16.96Z","The 501st strikes again!","<p>The 501st legion is one of the most seen clone battalions on-screen in the animated Clone Wars series. Despite this fact, only two LEGO sets have been fully revolved around the Legion&#39;s efforts, this one and the #75004 Z-95 Headhunter. However, that is all about to change with the upcoming #75280 501st Legion Clone Troopers, so I thought it would be time to write a review on one of the best sets that I own.</p>

<p>In this review, I will be going through the box, instructions,&nbsp;parts, minifigures, build, completed model, overall opinion and an extra history lesson for those of you who aren&#39;t accustomed to either the 501st Legion or the concept of AT-RTs. Without further ado, I&nbsp;shall begin.</p>

<h3><b>History:</b></h3>

<p>An AT-RT is an All Terrain Recon Transport and is the predecessor of the more famous AT-ST used by the Empire at the height of its reign. The AT-RT is manned by an Advanced Recon Force Scout Trooper, or ARF troopers. The vehicles were painted to blend in with its surroundings as much as possible, whether that be the landscape or the Legion using it, in this case the latter. Usually, larger vehicles like Turbo Tanks would be taken to the front lines and the AT-RT would be left to support the police, clean up in the post-battle efforts and civil defense, but sometimes the Republic&#39;s endeavours required a smaller, more agile transport to rely on when in the midst of punishing terrain. A few examples of this would be the Second Battle for Geonosis in The Clone Wars, the Attack on Umbara in The Clone Wars&nbsp;and the campaign on Kashyyyk seen in Episode III.</p>

<p>The 501st Legion is a military division of Clone Troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic. Under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker,&nbsp;Clone Captain Rex and occasionally padawan Ahsoka Tano, the 501st is infamous throughout the galaxy for its historic assaults during the Battle of Christophis, the Second Battle for Geonosis and the Battle of Umbara to name a few. The 501st Legion often served beside Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s&nbsp;212th Attack Battalion and occasionally flew Z-95 Headhunters and LAAT Gunships. The 501st is home to some of the finest Clone officers, including ARC Troopers Fives, Echo and Jesse. After Order 66, the 501st murdered the majority of younglings in the Jedi Temple and became Stormtroopers known as Vader&#39;s Fist and reported directly to Darth Vader.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve got the nerdy bit out of the way, let&#39;s continue.</p>

<h3><b>Packaging/Instructions:</b></h3>

<p>I no longer have the box on hand, so for those desperate to see it, the official LEGO images can be found here, under &#39;more images&#39;:&nbsp;https://brickset.com/sets/75002-1/AT-RT</p>

<p>There are 3 numbered bags containing parts for each stage of the set, the smallest being the first one, containing all 4 minifigures.</p>

<p>I used the online instructions because the box and the accompanying instructions are in the loft and probably out of immediate reach. As usual, the online instructions aren&#39;t great, but I didn&#39;t have any problems discerning colours.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts:</strong></h3>

<p>There are 222 pieces used in the build. I&#39;d say that 2/6&nbsp;of the pieces are the 501st blue, another 1/6&nbsp;is dark grey and 2/6&nbsp;are light grey. A very small amount are odd colours like black, brown and yellow, which make up the last 1/6. There are a few rare pieces. The flag comes in 5 other sets, the dish comes in 8&nbsp;others and the slope comes in 9 other sets (please note that the sticker has been pre-applied).</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures:</strong></h3>

<p>This set has 3 minifigs and a buildable Droideka, which Brickset calls a minifig and I&#39;m going by Brickset, so the Droideka is a minifig.</p>

<p>Sniper Droideka:</p>

<p>The Sniper Droideka was only seen in The Clone Wars animated TV show once, in Season 4, Episode 11 &#39;Kidnapped&#39;, when Anakin and Obi-Wan dispatched them pretty easily and is unique to this set.&nbsp;This minifig is the main build of Bag 1&nbsp;and is built around a 2x2 round plate with 8 bars. It utilises 41 pieces.&nbsp;It has three legs that attach to bars. The droid has a long pole which acts as the droid&#39;s sniper barrel. There isn&#39;t much more to it other than that.</p>

<p>501st Legion Clone Trooper:</p>

<p>The 501st Legion Trooper only comes in one other set- the Z-95 Headhunter (#75004) Starting from the top, the trooper&#39;s helmet has some amazing blue&nbsp;printing on the Phase II helmet, which corresponds with the &#39;Y&#39; seen in the TV content. Underneath the helmet, the minifigure has the old Clone face. The torso is a regular Phase II armour print, but has a strip of blue going halfway down the armour. The arms are fully blue, but only the shoulders are blue, with the rest of the arms white, but I think it would have been a little bit of a push to ask LEGO to do white arm printing as well as producing a pristine figure. The back of the torso finishes the utility belt and features a nice backplate. His legs have a little more blue and grey&nbsp;printing. He is armed with a regular black blaster.</p>

<p>Commando Droid Captain:</p>

<p>This minifigure is unique to this set, although the only thing that differentiates it from the normal Commando Droids is the white printing on the very top of its head, giving it authority over the other 4 Commando Droids that exist in the LEGO world. Its torso is the regular Commando Droid one- the Battle Droid torso recoloured with a red spot on its left-hand side (from its perspective). The arms are straight, dark brown battle droid ones with one up and the other sideways. The legs are long and joined together at the bottom. It wields a standard black blaster.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50066000627_3376e6b76f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 85px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50065999947_e75d90426e_o.jpg"" style=""width: 113px; height: 85px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50065186818_13ce54704f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 120px; height: 85px;"" /></p>

<p>Yoda:</p>

<p>Yoda is unique to this set. Yoda&#39;s head is made from a rubbery plastic, making it easier&nbsp;to manufacture the mould. He has his iconic green&nbsp;pointed ears and his face has remained unchanged for a while. The only difference is that the hair on the back is white, rather than grey. His torso shows a tan robe over an orange-tan loose shirt. There is a hood printed on the back. He has short, un-bendable tan legs. He is armed with his traditional green balded lightsabre.</p>

<h3><strong>Build:</strong></h3>

<p>The build is separated into three bags. The first has the minifigures, the second has the parts for the AT-RT legs and the third has the parts for the head and some leg details. It doesn&#39;t use any interesting techniques other than connecting the head to the legs with a technic axle. It took me between 20 and 25 minutes casually building.</p>

<p>The first bag:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50065999972_d006125caf_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 44px;"" /></p>

<p>The model makes good use of 4 stickers on the front of the model, showing the 501st&#39;s ownership. The 501st trooper sits snugly on the walker, with a gun holster on the back whilst he is driving. The antenna allows communication between scout parties. The AT-RT has a nice long barrel on the front of the model. It looks a lot like the TV content. There are some nice textures and curves throughout the model, capturing the agile and sturdy frame of the walker. That was the last of the good stuff.</p>

<p>The feet are too large. They are supposed to be robust, but they are a lot bigger than in official content. I can&#39;t see how those feet are going to carry the pilot stealthily and quickly across rough terrain. They aren&#39;t agile enough in my opinion. The legs are pretty much unposable. There is only one position that I can move the feet for it to not topple over.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></h3>

<p>The unfortunate unposable legs definitely take some of the play value but with 3 unique minifigures and one that only comes in one other set, I can only complain to a certain extent. Personally, I don&#39;t use it for play and it mostly sits on my shelf looking marvellous, but on the rare occasion when my brother wants to use it, he is perfectly satisfied with it being stationary and unposable. The set features stunning aesthetics and for just &pound;19.99 or $19.99 at retail (0.09ppp/0.09cpp) it was a steal. Currently, the 501st trooper is in high demand and is fetching&nbsp;the original retail value, whilst the set is valued at &pound;39 new and &pound;23 used, although I think that it is being bought for a lot more than that. I strongly recommend adding this set to your Star Wars collection if you can find it at a reasonable price. Thanks for reading and check out my other picture reviews!</p>

The build is great and the blue color really contrasts the other bland grey walkers in Lego Star Wars. I think the designers got the design of the walker spot on and it shows. The minifigs are a bit boring, but the 501st trooper has beautiful printing and the sniper droideka is a unique build that we haven&#39;t seen since this set&#39;s release. The walker is a nice build and includes sufficient detail. The only real downside to this set is the sheer lack of playability though. Contrary to its name, it&#39;s really hard to put the walker into any walking positions. Granted this is a problem for all Lego 2 legged walkers, but it&#39;s kind of disappointing that the only playability comes from turning the canon and unfolding the droideka. This is a great small set to display next to other clone wars sets and is a really good looking model.</p>
