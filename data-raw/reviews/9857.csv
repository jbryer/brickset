"zipsforbananas","2013-01-01T18:47:49.81Z","The sleekest Rebel fighter gets a sleek overhaul!","<p>The A-Wing has come a long way in Lego since the awfully bright red and bricky 7134, and I'm sure we've all said it about previous versions, particularly the great racing green Home One model (7754), but I'm sure we've finally arrived with this one! It's sleek, well made, and as with every set since mid 2012 the figures are superb!</p><p><b>Figures</b> first, from the lesser to the greater, we begin with...<br><b>Admiral 'it's a trap!' Ackbar</b>. (bodes well for the other two if he's first doesn't it!)&nbsp;He's about the same as the Home One figure, also seen on keyrings and I think magnets, except that the printing for his head markings and eyes are far darker. That might not seem so great, but Home One was a big and limited set, so it's great to have him in a small, accessible set - and he's got his coffee cup! (A theme with the Hoth Battle set's mug and sausage?)<br><b>Han Solo</b>, as befits him in an Episode VI set,&nbsp;is in his Endor fatigues. He has his usual face and the same legs as in the Endor Bunker set (8038), but his torso is much improved. His jacket has pockets printed, and his shirt is beautifully crumpled.<br>But the figure I've been salivating over since the first photo is the <b>A-Wing pilot</b>, and he doesn't disappoint. He's in the same gorgeous dark green as the last A-Wing, a vast improvement on the old bland green. His torso detailing is fantastic, and like the other Rebel pilots in 2013 (Luke in 75014, and the B-Wing pilot in the planet series) he has great leg printing with all the straps and buckles represented. He's already a great figure, and he's topped off with his head and helmet. The helmet is incredible, wonderfully moulded and printed with details like his microphone represented. And his face is double sided, determined on the one, and all ""I'm-about-to-crash-into-the-super-star-destroyer's-bridge""-y on the other! He's no generic A-Wing pilot, it's <b>Arvel Crynyd</b>!</p><p>The <b>A-Wing</b> itself doesn't initially look so different to 6207 and the one in 7754, more like another update as 7754 itself was of 6207. But the moment you start building you see it's a very different piece; many of the elements just have to be the same of course, but Lego have gone back to the drawing board with the structure.</p><p>On <b>the build</b>, you begin with the underside, but it's mercifully one large plate and has a second layer of plates giving the wedge shape. One layer of bricks takes you all the way up to cockpit height, and the 'floor' around is no longer the intricate combination of plates and wedge plates, but just one 2x8 plate and two large wing pieces. The engines are much the same as 7754, and the rear view is by far the best and most accurate looking of any version, with very clever construction and bricks every which way up. The side guns are attached to Technic at this level, meaning the constant problem of the guns always being slightly off line and looking wonky is solved. And for those who like them they are four quite good flick-fire missiles - and for those who don't they don't look like flick-fire missiles so it's okay!<br>The biggest improvement with the main body is the new long 1x10 slopes that finally allow the nose to have the slot it should have in it. The cockpit is also attached by a clip (a theme at the moment it seems, and a good one), meaning the space that always had to be made for the hinge piece isn't needed, and it can open beyond vertical which looks far better. The top fins epitomise the overall improvement, seeming so much more slick and sturdily constructed with the 1x4 brick, 1x2x2 slope and the curved brick at the back.<br>I'm a little puzzled by the part that fills the back of the ship. Like 7754 it lifts out, fixed here by the new-ish 2x2-with-one-stud plate, but all it is is a glowing core of some sort, not an engine. The part that forms the back of the cockpit is well put together, with use of the new 1x2-plate-with-2-studs-on-the-side bit allowing a horizontal grille coming out flush with the top. It's good, but I can't work out why it lifts out!<br></p><p>One neutral/poor point is the stickers. I don't hate them the way some do, and with 16 of them you should steer clear if you are sticker-averse, but they're a bit of a mixed bag. I love the look of them, they give a really great look to the slopes they embellish, and the control screen is fantastic with the view of the super star destroyer bridge he's about to crash into. But there are a few too many of them for a set this size - 1 for every 10 pieces in the ship! And though most of them are easy enough to apply the long red ones aren't so easy to get straight, and the triangular ones on the end of the wedges and the ones round the engines and cockpit are pretty tricky to line up and get central. I'd expect most would struggle to get them all straight, and that most people's patience would run out on the way as you feel like you're spending longer putting stickers on than actually building!</p><p>And I have to mention the <b>price</b> - though it's a good small and cheap set, the price is quite high for the part count. £19.99 would have been a far better reflection of the set, and of the $24.99 US price! This is especially clear looking at the comparably-sized 2010 Landspeeder (8092) which had 5 figures (6 if you count the brick-built droid) but was only £1 more.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>So sleek, she's finally a really beautiful ship</li><li>The figures as always are so well printed, and the pilot himself is absolutely wonderful</li><li>Good building techniques for such a small set, and so much more coherent than previous versions</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Far too many stickers for a set this size, and some are awkward to apply</li><li>Really poor choice of UK price given the piece count, US price, and comparable sets.<br>Still, even if it's a dreadful decision, it's still only £25 instead of £20 - a matter of £5 is hardly the end of the world!</li></ul>
<p>The old, blocky 7134 can be forgotten. In fact the 2006 vintage now seems shoddy, and even the lovely green Home One set now looks a bit sad next to this set. It's so much better than I was expecting, not a step up but a complete reboot, so sleek and sturdy she's a beaut! The figures, particularly the pilot, are just tremendous. The reliance on stickers may annoy some, and I do wish the engines and cockpit were printed. But then that would push up the price, and given the factors I mentioned I'd say it's a perfect must have if only they'd taken £5 off it! Get past the stickers and price and this set is absolutely brilliant in every way.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Lord_Kun","2013-02-05T10:14:56.92Z","Great design, likeness and yes, stickers...","I immediately fell in love just with the picture of this new A-Wing Lego incarnation and I fell compelled to buy my own one, because it always has been my third favourite Rebel Starfighter (the second after the X Wing is the B, but I'm still waiting for a good version out of bricks).<br><br>The <b>build </b>was quite simple and you will focus real soon on how this strange start on the instructions could take to the A Wing peculiar shapes. It's about in the middle, when you apply the huge white wing pieces, that all the cunning solutions come and the lovely, smooth appareance of this recon Starfighter begins to surface.<br>Yes, it's simple with those huge pieces and maybe a lot of you are gonna complain about having little to build, but it's the same paradox in having to design something that has to be similar to the movies. The rear is a bit simple and ripetitive to build, but I love the 
complicate appearance of the rounded 1x1 grey pieces, something that we 
could not usually find in many starships that looks so good on the 
front.<br><br>As for me, I couldn't be more happy with the choices of <b>parts</b>: I turn the complete build in my hand over and over and all the time I look at it, it reminds me of the A Wing. Totally.<br><br>So, the reason for one rate missing is pretty obvious as you open your box: too, too, too many stickers.<br>All you see in the pictures of colored different from the base of the pieces are stickers (except for the Minifigs) and there are at least two pair of them that are difficult to apply: the long red ones on the nose and the ones of the glass. Be prepared for them and have a lot of patience, the only advice I can give is to detach the pieces before applying the stickers; if possible find a flat, large piece to use as a base.<br>As for me, I came prepared watching and reading other reviews and I applied all of them before beginning the build, just by going on the instructions till I found where they had to be.<br><br>It's immediate to <b>play </b>with this set, the Starfighter itself it's just a pair of engines with a pilot in the middle. What comes as a disadvantage it's its small weight, so put a little of carefulness when you swoosh it... I've already crashed it twice. But it's a little sturdy one and you could be sure of the nose's hardness; the parts that are the most likely to come off are of course the missiles and the upper and lower white protections for the engines in the back.<br>As for the first ones, yes, they flick and it was a little disappointing that they made also the laser cannons so similar of missiles: I've seen that almost all people think that they are just another pair of, maybe, stronger missiles. Well, they are not and they are supposed to stay in place.<br><br>Another part I'm a little disappointed with is the fact that you have almost to lie down your pilot, when in the cockpit, for the glass to be in place. This is a good solution to maintain the line of the Starfighter, but it disturbs me that he actually can't reach his control panel: this could be at least mitigate by have him seat a layer lower, separating the long, grey piece in the base on which he sits.<br><br>Despite having seen a lot of pictures, the engine part that comes off to be ""repaired"" was a surprise to me and it looks real good to be seen. All the part immediately behind the cockpit is functional to have it removed and put back again with ease and yes, it works well. What I could complain is that it's also the part that you have to take if you want to play with your fully Starfighter and it's a little bit unstable (you could feel it's only attached in a single point). The good news is that it couldn't come off because you tighten it precisely by putting your finger on it, but, added to the cannons and pilot position unsatisfactions, it does cost a rate for me.<br><br>On the other side, the landing gear it's really the one and fits perfectly in the shapes of the nose, so when you fly it, it disappears completely. I hope to find this level of perfection in all the other starships I'll buy.<br><br>A bit of words for the minifigures, even they are not my real interest: the Pilot it's <i>great </i>in all his details and the printing are the top I've evere seen in whatever else minifigure. Han it's good to be given as a gift (you like him, Alessandra, doesn't you?) and Ackbar make a good addition as he it's a lot more related to the set than General Solo. Love the coffee mug, by the way.<br><br>As it always happen, the <b>price </b>for this set is too much. At least 5-8€ (or 10$) less for sure. You get three minifigures, but only one is the pilot and the Starfighter itself it's small from the beginning source. The box is at least a bit more of a reasonable size, compared to the finished build.<br><br><b>Overall</b>, I love and enthusiast with it, and it looks really great once finished. I can't take off any rate because they made a really good job in creating the same shapes of the original A Wing and I want to reward this to Lego, as this was my main concern.<br>I recommend it most to AFOL than Kids and Teens, just because the beautifulness of the design takes over the playability, in my opinion. Surely it's great just by looking at it in landing mode!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,3
"Rogue_Colonel","2013-06-09T09:24:14.96Z","""Increase forward firepower!""","<p>The fourth version of the Starfighter follows in the wake of last years updates to both the X-Wing and Y-Wing, both were excellent and certainly the best versions done so far, but would this one continue the trend?</p><p>The answer is yes, this is by far the best version of this vehicle.</p><p>Build is relatively simple and although it feels like your putting together the last version of this set (6207 or 7754) but it looks vastly different . &nbsp;The minifigs are fantastic in being an A-Wing pilot (with accurate helmet), Admiral Ackbar and Han Solo. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Pros</b></p>

"Nesquik","2013-05-07T15:53:31.57Z","A-Wing gets an A+","<b>Minifigures</b><div>Though all Star Wars Lego sets tend to promote minifigures as both a collectors item and play feature, the A-Wing is quite original in that all the characters don't seem a natural team. In the original movie <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, the pilot would of course been flying this craft (though we only saw glimpses of different ones), Admiral Ackbar was figuring out whether ""it was"" a trap or not, and Han Solo was busy running around on the planet Endor. Each of these characters were in three different sub-plots of the film.</div><div><br></div><div>Never the less, TLG were obviously trying to find an opportunity to release these characters together in a more affordable product, so I'm very happy to see them together. The Pilot - equipped with a spanner for repairs - has some excellent printing on both his legs and torso, while the face is two-sided to reveal both concentration and anxiety. Han Solo is featured in his latest printing that is significantly more detailed than the last, and he get's a lovely little blaster to hold. Our star however, Admiral Ackbar (who I referred to as ""the fish man"" at &nbsp;seven-years old) is simply delightful. The headpiece is completely unique, and I can't help but chuckle when I look at it as Ackbar is such a funny looking creature. He simply wouldn't look out of place anywhere in the Lego world!<br><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Build and Play</b></div><div>The relative ease of construction was, in this model's case, a welcome pleasure for a Star Wars O.T product. Part of the reason that the A-Wing may not be as complex to build as the X-Wing Starfighter or TIE is that it simply doesn't haven't the same amount of screen time or significance as other crafts in the Star Wars universe; though a separate argument would be that the A-Wing really is just a lot more compact.</div><div><br></div><div>As a result, you won't encounter any problems during the build. I'm delighted that the craft is so sturdy in completion as there are far too many fragile Star Wars models out there. This makes the A-Wing an ideal choice for children because it doesn't fall apart easily, and the use of more standard Lego bricks helps to make the build simple but fun.</div><div><br></div><div>During play, the A-Wing isn't as easy to hold for a typical 'swoosher', but the general bulk of the craft and the nice two-toned colour scheme make it a great addition to any young Jedi's army. The rear section of the craft - or behind the cockpit more specifically - has a removable engine unit that the pilot can be working on if it requires maintenence. I won't lie - upon seeing this small build on the back of the packaging, I assumed it was either a large toolkit or a very posh lunch box!</div><div><br></div><div>For the periods of inactivity, a small (if loose) landing gear is also present. And of course, we have flick missiles... Four of them in fact. Doh.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Final Thoughts</b></div></div><div>More so than any other starfighter model at present, the A-Wing represents a great balance between durability and authenticity; the former very much welcome for children. Though the minifigures are truly excellent, AFOL's shouldn't want to rush out and buy this product too soon. At £25, this is the kind of product that can budget towards any future Star Wars promotions, because there are better minifigure-model combinations out there that you could spend your money on at the moment (most notably, Desert Skiff). But in short, there really is nothing bad to say about this lovely craft and it's great characters.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"paulmison","2013-02-05T15:26:29.66Z","Great shape, lots of fun, and excellent figures, but a wee bit too expensive.","<p>I&#39;m a sucker for Original Trilogy spaceships, so I was looking out for this as soon as it appeared in the shops. The thing is, was I happy with it, and how did it compare to the previous A-wing, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6207-1"">2006&#39;s 6207</a>?</p>

<p>The <b>box</b>&nbsp;is a little shorter than that for 6207, but the Yoda dark green design really works. The pictures on the back, with the ship returning to a hangar to be greeted by Ackbar and Solo, are pretty nice too. The <b>instructions</b>&nbsp;are a little verbose for my liking, but that&#39;s the way Lego have been moving for some time, so that&#39;s fine. I didn&#39;t notice any mistakes.</p>

<p>If you like Republic dark red and white <b>parts</b>, this is a set for you. The only bright red pieces are a pair of hidden axles, and most of the greys are hidden in the underside or engine area. The A-wing is constructed of a few more pieces than the 2006 rendition- 6207 has more pieces but it also has a supporting ground vehicle. (Also missing from this set is its rather generic technician driver.)</p>

<p>As with many Star Wars sets recently, the <b>minifigures</b> are definitely a highlight. You probably have a few versions of Han Solo, but this one&#39;s unique to the set, sporting a Jedi-era jacket. Admiral Ackbar isn&#39;t new, but a set costing $25 is a bit easier to get hold of than one listed at $100, so it&#39;s the first chance I&#39;ve had to own him, and a lovely head sculpt it is too. Despite that, the A-wing pilot is probably the highlight, with a spiffy dark green torso and (printed) legs, double sided head, and a detailed helmet, complete with tiny microphone. It&#39;s barely comparable to the generic smiley face of the 2006 pilot, with a generic crash helmet and only front torso printing.</p>

<p>Each figure comes with their own accessory- a gun, transparent mug, and spanner/wrench respectively. I&#39;m not sure why Lego are so keen on putting mugs in their sets (every Town Traffic set seems to have one set on the dashboard) but it does let you make as many &quot;it&#39;s a frap!&quot; jokes as you like, which is enough reason for me.</p>

<p>The <b>build</b> is fun, and although it doesn&#39;t make a great deal of use of SNOT, when it does it&#39;s well done. The main drawback (as every reviewer seems to note) is the profusion of stickers- eleven in all, I think, and some of them look pretty fiddly to apply. Personally I&#39;ve left my model unadorned for the last few weeks and it doesn&#39;t look terrible, but I think I will add them.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, then, the&nbsp;<b>completed model</b> is very nicely done. There&#39;s a lot to play with- the ubiquitous flick fire missiles (which are nicely integrated with the source material), a removable engine stack, and landing gear (another change from 6207, although I know that the Home One A-wing also managed to add some). One particular point worth noting is that the new bar-style cockpit means there&#39;s no ugly gap in front of the canopy to allow it to open, which is another improvement, as is the use of a slight step back to integrate the notch in the nose (which Lego hadn&#39;t managed to model previously). Generally, it feels like a lot of subtle changes that add up to a far better model.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p>All in all, I do like the new A-wing; it&#39;s a very nice improvement in the core model and it comes with much more interesting figures than any previous (standalone) version. That said, the one thing that holds me back from a wholehearted recommendation is the price. Even in the US, $24.99 for under 200 pieces seems steep, especially when the previous rendition was nearer $16 for the same piece count. The UK has it even worse, with a leap from &pound;10 to &pound;25.</p>

<p>If, like me, you&#39;re a fan of the ship, or if you&#39;re a Star Wars minifigure fan, you&#39;ll probably grit your teeth and buy it anyway. For everyone else, I&#39;d recommend holding on and seeing if it drops later in the year (particularly since last year&#39;s $55 TIE fighter was regularly available for $35-$40). Once it&#39;s under $20, I&#39;d buy it without hesitation.</p>

"Scottyj6230","2013-02-12T18:42:47.6Z","Great ship that has a great update","<p>
Being a massive Star Wars Lego fan this was a set I have been looking forward to the reboot of.&nbsp; I have always felt that the previous versions of the A-Wing have been a little clunky. </p><p>I was not disappointed!!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Lego has stuck to its recent decrease in box size which is a good thing in one way and a bad in another.&nbsp; The good is on the environmental basis when you consider shipping costs etc, the bad for me personally is does the set fit inside when you want to store it without having to completely disassemble.</p><p>This box is deep and what it doesn't give in area, it gives in volume.&nbsp; On the front it has some great images of all of the minifigures and a large image of the main ship.&nbsp; On the rear there is a great set up which shows all of the playability features of this set.&nbsp; It also shows a nice little comic strip layout of the A-Wing in battle and then returning home to be greeted by the two other minifures in the set (I'll get to them later).&nbsp; The final image is a side, top, rear of the completed ship.</p><p>The instructions are concise and provide an easy build which is nicely broken down into well ordered parts.&nbsp; All in all this is a well packaged and well ordered build.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts used in the main ship are pretty much run of the mill Lego parts in nice dark red,&nbsp;white and&nbsp;light grey.&nbsp; If your a fan of the clone wars era or anything that could use these colour for MOC building then this set for £ 25.00 would be useful.</p><p>The set has very few printed parts which I personally don't like as Lego stickers have a tendency to peel after time.&nbsp; But if your a MOC'er then you can get some nice parts for use anywhere.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has three minifigures included, two&nbsp;of which are new and very exciting.&nbsp; First is the A-Wing pilot, he has a great front and rear print torso, which is a little like the X-Wing pilot torso but in green and then he has a printed legs which has what looks like a harness.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;a new helmet mould to with this figure which is outstanding, there really isn't much more to say about it other than that.&nbsp; One of the best parts of this that he has a double printed head, one side is a stern look which is probably based on the look going into battle the other is from a scene from the movie episode 6 when the pilot gets hit and crashes into the bridge of the Super Star Destoryer.</p><p>The next new mini is a new Han Solo figure, again he has a great front and rear printed torso with the printed legs showing the gun belt.&nbsp; I love the detail which Lego is giving to the Star Wars line as the characters have such a depth of detail, every little detail really makes a difference.</p><p>The last mini in the set is Admiral Ackbar which is not a new mini but still a great mini and is extremely welcome as he has not been seen for a while.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This build is from the bottom up and in the first bag includes the minis and the ship base plus the engines.&nbsp; Straight away you get the feel how solid this ship is going to be, now one noticeable difference between this model and the others that has come previously is that the weapons pods are now fixed and not on a swivel.&nbsp; Now I can find no reference to this in the Star Wars archive so is probably more correct to have this arrangement.</p><p>Bag 2 includes the nose/wing arrangement and a small engine pod for the rear.&nbsp; This again doesn't repeat to much and gives a very satisfying build.</p><p>Bag 3 completes the nose and adds the vertical tails and canopy to the model.&nbsp; It also adds the engine nacels to the engine mounts.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Overall this is a great model which passes the good old swoosh test with out standing marks.&nbsp; It is solid and very well designed,&nbsp;this model has hours of playability but also looks great a display piece.&nbsp; The cockpit has this nice snap down quality to it and even the engine which can be disconnected (which is the only week point for me) is nicely put together.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>On the whole this is a great model and one for any collector or kid to have in their collection.  I hope you have found this review helpful.</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-06T10:36:02.377Z","It's a Trap!","<p><strong>Set #75003 A-wing Starfighter: </strong>This ship was recently featured in the Home One Mon Cal Set, which featured Admiral Ackbar and Mon Mothma among other elements. The set was large, expensive and the fighter was a bonus really, still it's nice to be able to pick up another version in its own box for starfighter collectors and enthusiasts.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is the standard 2013 Star Wars box, with an image of Yoda in the top, celebrating The Yoda Chronicles and showing all three Mini-Figures with names. (Two of which are brand new.) The back shows off the features of the set (Flick-Fire Missiles *SIGH*) and a few other things such as the retractable front landing gear.</p>
<p>The instructions in this set are not protected by cardboard, a given for most 30$ sets and that is the Retail Price in Canada. (Recent sales have brought it more in line with the US price, so snatch it up when you see that.) They show the steps for building, which is very stright forward and fast to build for experienced builders. (This uses the numbered bag approach.) There are also images of the first batch of 2013 sets, a checklist of the Mini-Figures included and an online code for LEGO Star Wars.com.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has loads of parts, a lot of great pieces, mostly in white colours, or dark maroon and others are grey, overall a decent amount of parts for MOCers. Not sure on the rarity or uniqueness of any of them to be honest, possibly parts of the engine build, other than that nothing springs to mind.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Three Mini-Figures, standard for sets of this size from LEGO Star Wars. All of which are consistently good.</p>
<p>Admiral Ackbar isn't new, he was also available in 2009's Home One Mon Calimari Cruiser (More of a Playset really with the 'War Room' from that scene and a docking area for the included A-wing.) He has a unique new head piece, with brilliant detail and paint work. A double-sided torso for his uniform, complete with rank insignia and some nice rare dark brown colored hands. Accessory-wise he comes with a transparent coffee mug... I guess giving him a blaster too would have been too inaccurate to the on-screen appearance.</p>
<p>Han Solo is all new according to the box, I believe I've read somewhere it's only the leg print detail that is new, don't quote me on that. He's a nice looking Han figure, standard print work for his torso I believe capturing the likeness of the outfit worn in all three films, it's double-sided as well. Sadly no double-sided head, but his facial print is traditional Han Solo with the cocky smirk. He comes with a smaller blaster pistol for his weapon, overall a great looking Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>A-Wing Pilot... This Mini-Figure is also new and quite impressive, I have two of him thanks to a friendly Cashier at TRU who allowed me to select a free Star Wars Mini-Fig during one of their Mini-Fig events, I nabbed him because of how impressive he looks.</p>
<p>He's got an all green coloured primary plastic for the body, legs and torso, the torso is double-sided print featuring the breathing equipment worn by the pilots, the tubing which carries down through his waist and onto his leg printing. There is a lot of great detail work on the Mini-Fig, but it doesn't stop there. The brand new helmet piece is a great new sculpt, it looks properly bulky and features a lot of paint detailing for his insignia (call sign I believe), the communications equipment and a lot of the other detail found on the uniform from the film.</p>
<p>He's also sporting a Double-Sided print for the face, one side nervous and scared the other determined... In fact we've seen this exact same head before though I haven't reviewed that set yet. Yep, it's Samwise's head from LotR, guess LEGO wanted to save some costs on making an all new facial print. Not uncommon really, still it's a decent enough head that works. He comes with a wrench too for maintenance of the ship, kind of wish he had a blaster to be honest even if pilots don't traditionally use them.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set features three numbered bags, each section of the ship is built up as you go from bag 1 to bag 3, bag 1 is the fuselage for the engines, bag 2 is the nose section and part of the engine block I believe and part three builds the cockpit and the rest of the details, including landing gear and the engine cowlings. (Or whatever those bits are called on the back of the A-wing.)</p>
<p>It's a fast build with simple enough to follow instructions, I will say though that there are stickers for details and since there is no cardboard protection for the instructions. You could wind up with a horribly mangled sticker sheet if the packing didn't work right for the set.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that a few areas of the build seem to have clutch issues. Not sure why, but every time I handle the ship I find myself re-affirming the parts on the right side of the ship to keep them properly connected. They don't pop off or anything, but they do tend to rise up a bit, not sure why that is.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This A-wing is almost perfect, even with the sticker detailing. The one problem I have with this model is the flick-fire missile launchers. And they aren't optional because the starfighters weapons are part of the assembly. They don't stick out too badly compared to other designs from LEGO, but they are noticeable for not being flush against the sides of the ship. A rotational feature to store them underneath the wings and out of sight from the main laser turrets would have been much better for my tastes.</p>
<p>Potentially an easy to MOC solution for those who really can't stand it. Other than that minor nitpick this model is goregeous. As it is the first A-wing I own I can't compare it to past models, but I really enjoy it. It's a compact highly detailed model, which is easy to play with and hold in your hands, even for this Adult. (Although my hands are rather smallish compared to other adults hands...)</p>
<p>I really think LEGO has managed to do alright by the ship's design on this set. Not as iconic as the X-wing or Y-wing so not necessary to bring it back as often, but nice to see re-visited every now and again to build up a small armada of them for your starfighter fleet. The scale matches nicely with the Mini-Figs as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, buy this set. The design is sleek and chock full of detail (Some of which are admittedly stickers, but not intrusive stickers like on some models), the Mini-Figures are all tops and it's nice to see Admiral Ackbar available again in a cheaper set this time. (As the Home One has long since vanished from retailer shelves.) And the model is great fun to play with, great for Brickfilms too. I kind of wish the cluch power was a little better though, not sure why some of the pieces keep wanting to rise up a little, maybe its just the plastic on mine.</p>
<p>Still on the shelf it isn't too noticeable and it's a great set with good value for your dollar. So strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"tkettle9719","2013-06-21T23:12:36.263Z","It's A Trap!! (JK, it's Actually Really Well-Designed)","<p>I got this set a few months back for my birthday, and I have to say that
 I love this set. I got this mainly because I currently didn't have an 
A-Wing for my Rebel Fleet. It is very well-designed, and it looks very 
sleek and beautiful next to the other ships of the Rebellion. There is 
one thing that irks me, however, but it isn't that detrimental to my 
overall opinion. </p>
<h4>Pros <br></h4>
<ul><li>How much better can minifigures get after such an amazing past few years? The Admiral Ackbar head is a marvel in minifigure heads, Han Solo's pants look brilliant, but the real standout here is the A-Wing pilot, whose helmet really is one of the most amazing pieces in the history of Lego. <br></li><li>The ship is nice and sleek; it is visually a masterpiece in brick building. It's actually a bit larger than I was expecting it to be, and has a chunky, sturdy feel to it, but it still looks beautiful and accurate to the movie model. <br></li><li>The color scheme is ideal to my tastes for an A-Wing; I could never quite enjoy the green in the Home One Calamari set, so the return to red is definitely a plus for me. <br></li><li>Another small thing I really liked were the accessories given to each minifigure; it was a small, yet nice, touch to make it that much better. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>SO... MANY... STICKERS! I have counted sixteen stickers in this one $25 set. SIXTEEN! They really make the ship stand out, but they are just so dreadful to put on, and the number of them really puts you on halt. <br></li><li>I also am not a fan of the flick-fire missiles here; like the 9492 TIE Fighter from 2012, the missiles here should have been an actual part of the ship, not something easily removable. This doesn't bother me insanely like the stickers, but it is something that I don't really like. <br></li><li>Also, although I love all three minifigures in here, I think that I would have been happy with just the pilot in here. I know that Lego is becoming a minifigure frenzy-based company in the past few years, but Han Solo feels a little bit out-of-place to me. <br></li></ul>
<p>I think that the ship here is presented on tip-top form. It's probably the best thing in this set, which is really great. The minifigs are also on top form here, but one of them in particular makes the $25 mark seem a bit extraneous to me. Either way, if you find it on sale or not, I highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan. It is one of the best ships ever assembled. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"PooPotato","2014-04-02T23:31:03.89Z","The Sports Car of the Rebel Fleet","<p>Though I tend to collect larger ground based vehicle sets from the Prequel Trilogy, I have a fondness for the Original Trilogy&#39;s space battles, which were massive, epic, and had a very human quality to them since neither side used droids. &nbsp;I missed out on the Y-Wing, (which I plan to buy on eBay), but was able to purchase this, and I have to say I was VERY impressed with what I bought.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Nothing special about the box or instructions, very standard.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>If you love purchasing Star Wars vehicles to create new aircraft or starfighters, this set is for you. There are plenty of dark red and white pieces to satisfy any aircraft enthusiast</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The price is great for this set, as you get a sleek Rebel fighter and 3 minifigs!</p>

<p>Arvel Crynyd (A-Wing Pilot) is a brand new minifigure, and looks wonderful piloting his aircraft. &nbsp;He is most known for being irreparably&nbsp;damaged while fighting in the Battle of Endor, and crashing his A-Wing into the command bridge of Darth Vader&#39;s flagship <em>The Executor,&nbsp;</em>effectively destroying it and all on board. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Admiral Ackbar was a first for me, although his head mold wasn&#39;t. &nbsp;He can be associated with this set because immediately after Crynyd crashed his A-Wing into the Super Star Destroyer, he is seen breathing a sigh of relief with his other Mon Calimari&nbsp;allies in the bridge of the Home One Cruiser. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Han Solo was not a new character for me to own, but his torso made him exclusive to this set until 10236 Ewok Village came out. &nbsp;He is a great improvement over the Endor Han Solo included with 8038 The Battle of Endor, with a new vest with cartridge pockets and a new head design (strangely enough, my 8038 came with Han with his new head design, possibly due to me buying it after production ceased). &nbsp;He comes with a rather accurate depiction of his sidearm in the films, and looks great next to the shield bunker, although he really is out of place in this set.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was not over complicated and included some very nice SNOT techniques. &nbsp;The SNOT really gives this set a sleek look. &nbsp;Another thing I enjoyed about the build, although it was small, was the building of the engine compartment behind the cockpit. &nbsp;I loved when in older sets you could take out the engine of the model. &nbsp;It gave the set more character, and allowed more play. &nbsp;However this build was not without it&#39;s drawbacks. &nbsp;One very notable problem is the amount of stickers. &nbsp;There are a total of 16 (if I counted correctly), and would be very hard for a younger builder to put on. &nbsp;Luckily I was blessed with incredibly stable hands (I have actually considered becoming a surgeon due to this trait), and was able to put all of the stickers on nicely. &nbsp;The stickers don&#39;t detract from the model at all, and I especially like the white stripes on the thrusters. &nbsp;The cockpit stickers were necessary in my opinion, but the long side stickers could be omitted and the craft would still look great.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The completed model looks great next to my 6212 X-Wing Fighter (I have heard great things about the new s-foil mechanism on the new one, I plan on purchasing it soon and making a comparison to the old one), and also looks good next to 4504 Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;I would recommend getting the Y-Wing and X-Wing before purchasing this set, as the A-Wing only appears in Return of the Jedi, while the X-Wing and Y-Wing appear in all of the Original Trilogy films. &nbsp;I imagine this set will look great next to the 2014 B-Wing, although I am clueless of where I&#39;ll have room for such a long fighter as that!</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>This set looks wonderful, the stickers weren&#39;t, but it was definitely worth $25 in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>3 rare minifigs</p>

<p>Very sleek looking A-Wing</p>

<p>Great design</p>

<p>Looks awesome next to other Rebel spacecraft</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Stickers</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set, unless you have a mortal fear of stickers.</p>

"Aragosta","2016-01-07T16:39:28.347Z","Great despite its many stickers","<p>It is early January 2016 as I write this. This morning I went into town hoping to find some new Force Awakens stuff. Alas, there were no new sets to be found. At one store I saw this small set. Currently retired and the last one on the shelf. At &euro; 31,99 it certainly wasn&#39;t cheap. But I did not want to come home from the hunt empty-handed.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A small sturdy cardboard box with a nice picture of the starfighter flying thru space. This is a 2013 set with Yoda in the corner. In the bottom right corner we see the three minifigures of Admiral Ackbar, Han Solo and the A-wing Pilot. More on the figures later. Turning around to the backside we see a few more pictures of the starfighter from different angles and in different positions.</p>

<p>The instructions booklet is 60 pages thick. I did not find any mistakes in it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The build contains a number of white sloped pieces, big and small. Two big wedged white plates. A smokey black cockpit screen. And a number of dark red pieces, among which an 8x16 plate and the two thruster pieces. There is also a sticker sheet with a whopping 16 stickers! Technically they are not parts but I did want to mention them here as they make up a big part of this model.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The top side of the box tells us Han Solo and the A-wing Pilot are new. This means they were new for 2013. Han has since apeared in set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10236-1/Ewok-Village"" target=""_blank"">10236</a>: Ewok Village.</p>

<p><strong>A-wing Pilot</strong><br />
The best figure of the bunch &ndash; as he should be! He operates the vehicle after all. He has printing on all his pieces, head, torso (front and back) and legs. He has a new helmet piece with paint and printing applied all around. This is really an impressive piece of work! The fine details are superb. The head is double sided and has a stern expression on one side and an &quot;Oh crud, I&#39;m gonna crash!&quot; expression on the back. He comes with a spanner for maintenance work on his craft. This is the only set this figure has appeared in. There have been other <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs?query=Rebel%20Pilot%20A-Wing"" target=""_blank"">A-wing pilots</a> in the past but they were not as well made as this one.</p>

<p><strong>Han Solo</strong><br />
It&#39;s not often that main cast members get thrown in small sets so this inclusion is quite nice. Solo has printing on the head, torso (front and back) and legs. As I mentioned this figure only appeared in one other, much more expensive set so it&#39;s a somewhat rare figure to have. It&#39;s a recognizable version of Han. Even though I think his LEGO hair looks off. He does not have a double sided face but he does come with his pistol.</p>

<p><strong>Admiral Ackbar</strong><br />
You can tell by the cartoony eyes that this is an older figure. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve already seen the new Ackbar that comes with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75140-1/Resistance-Troop-Transporter"" target=""_blank"">75140</a>: Resistance Troop Transporter where his eyes are printed with finer detail. It&#39;s nice to have anyway. The big eyes give it more of a classic LEGO Star Wars feel. After all &ndash; this figure first appeared in 2009 the year LEGO Star Wars celebrated its tenth year. The set was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7754-1/Home-One-Mon-Calamari-Star-Cruiser"" target=""_blank"">7754</a>: Home One Mon Calamari Star and one year later he made a return in a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/852843-1/Star-Wars-Magnet-Set"" target=""_blank"">magnet pack</a>. Back when magnet packs were still a way to get figures cheap.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Bag 1 builds the base of the model and ends with adding the thrusters on the back. Bag 2 build the &#39;hood&#39; of the craft &ndash; adding all the sloped and slanted pieces. This part of the build is quite sticker heavy. And some are a pain to apply. If you have a child building this, offer to help. Stickers are pretty much a one shot deal. If you get them on the wrong way, you won&#39;t be able to try again... Bag 3 adds the engine, cockpit, stand and fins. The build ends with putting two stickers over the windscreen. Again, pay attention when applying these.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>If you can get past the stickers, this is a nice little set. The stickers DO add to the detailed look of the craft I must say. The figure has to lean back inside the cockpit a bit. There&#39;s a bit of open space to allow his helmet to fit when he lies back. It doesn&#39;t look too bad but it is a tight fit. You can also take out the engine behind the cockpit. I think they copied this feature from set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7754-1/Home-One-Mon-Calamari-Star-Cruiser"" target=""_blank"">7754</a> which also had an A-wing in it. LEGO probably put it there to have an additional feature next to the flick fire missiles. Speaking of which, the flick fires are alright with me as they look like actual guns.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great little set, even if it was overpriced. I&#39;m happy to have it. If you can still find it, this is a great spacecraft with some very good minifigures. I&#39;d recommend it to kids and AFOLs alike!</p>

"Kalgoras","2014-10-23T10:41:40.98Z","Great Set, but a lot of stickers!","<p>So after recently starting to collect Lego again as an adult and having many regrets about giving away my old Lego many years ago, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the SW Universe and the great Lego sets that have been produced. &nbsp;I&#39;ve just started off and built&nbsp;a few of the new sets, so thought I&#39;d help a few others as this one had a few bits I wanted to let people know about. &nbsp;Please bear with me as it&#39;s my first review, but wanted to give some feedback to others after this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Decent little box; however it&#39;s such a shame that these smaller boxes need to be physically damaged to get inside. &nbsp;As somebody who wants to store these boxes, a normal &#39;flap&#39; which we can open and close with a factory seal would be much better!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Couple of nice interesting bits, but overall pretty standard. &nbsp;Not a huge amount of parts for the price; however I managed to pick mine up at a discount as part of a bundle, so look for a sale!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These are really excellent, having 3 in a small set is very nice. &nbsp;Especially the pilot figure, who has a great helmet and scheme. &nbsp;The other two are well done as usual; however nothing spectacular.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Overall a simple build; with one massive caveat! &nbsp;For those buying for kids to play with, it&#39;s very sturdy with a great removable engine and figures along with missiles and a cockpit. &nbsp;The big caveat I mentioned is the very large sticker sheet compared to the kit size. &nbsp;As somebody who wants to collect more than play with this, the stickers took as long to apply as the actual build as many are large, in prominent places and applied to curved surfaces. &nbsp;It took me a long time to be happy with the placement; so be prepared if you want to collect this set.</p>

<p>Several of the stickers, particularly the two large triangular&nbsp;white stickers on the front &#39;corners&#39; and the two long thin red stickers on the front of the ship are in symmetrical patterns and any misalignment sticks out a mile when you build it.</p>

<p>There are also 4 stickers applied to the curve at the back of&nbsp;the two engines; which are also a complete pain the bottom to get aligned correctly. &nbsp;I found it easiest to line the stickers up with the raised &#39;ridge&#39; at the base of each of these curved sections, as it&#39;s easier to judge the vertical placement than trying to line up from the top where there are no nearby straight features. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A little tip I used on the two large white triangular stickers is that the first smallest&nbsp;black line near the narrow&nbsp;front point of the triangle comes right down to a mould line in the plastic on the white Lego pieces. &nbsp;On the box it shows this exactly as the smallest&nbsp;black line on the sticker&nbsp;comes down onto the 3rd &#39;tooth&#39; at the edge of the block&nbsp;which has a mould line&nbsp;running up the centre. &nbsp;This section of the block with the &#39;teeth&#39; is also a straight edge, so it&#39;s useful to line the bottom of the sticker up with this edge to get the &#39;vertical&#39; and then use the moulding and the small black line to get the &#39;horizontal&#39; alignment.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great look when completed and very sturdy. &nbsp;Opening cockpit, removable engine and 3 Minifigs make it very playable and it looks great for collectors too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Recommend the model as it&#39;s a great start or addition to any collection and I have a soft spot for the original Trilogy models. &nbsp;Just be aware of the stickers, so if you really hate them, it might be wiser to save some pain and give this a miss; however you&#39;ll miss out on a sturdy little ship. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this has been useful to some!</p>

"Denthur","2020-03-21T12:05:54.527Z","Best version of the A-Wing","<p>Got this set when it released in 2013, finally got around to rebuilding it after it got disassembled about 4-5 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The minifigures; one of the only sets to contain an OT version of Admiral Ackbar, and a thumpin good one at that, the printing on the head piece is excellent for 2013 standards. Han is a nice touch, however, the face is a bit basic, it would have been better if it was dual-sided. The Rebel A-Wing pilot is a really great pilot minifigure, and the way that the printing of the tubes lines up between his torso and his legs is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: This is the single greatest Rebel A-Wing LEGO has ever produced. It captures the smooth, curvy look of the A-Wing brilliantly, while still using sloped bricks on the side. The way the engines are designed is clever, using a technic axle to slot the secondary part of the engines in, and any ship with landing gear is okay in my book! I also appreciate how the space behind the cockpit can be removed, revealing the ship&#39;s power core (assumed).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The build; There isn&#39;t much space to place weapons, the cannons on either side of the ship look janky as flick-fire missiles, the space at the back of the ship between the engines could use a bit more greebling to make it look more technical.</p>

"Bogdan501st","2022-01-28T13:26:52.663Z","A very nostalgic set","<p>This is one of my favourite sets of all time, so this review might be subjective. Anyway, here are my thoughts on this set:</p>

<p><strong>Play value</strong></p>

<p>This A-Wing was released in 2013, one year prior to the introduction of stud shooters and spring-loaded missiles. As a result, the cannons incorporate four classic flick-fire missiles, whilst being aesthetically pleasing. Other play features include retractable land gear in the front and&nbsp;the ability to open up the cockpit and place a figure inside the interior space, albeit crammed. A very fun&nbsp;play feature is the fact that you can take out the vessel&#39;s engine, situated behind the cockpit. The included wrench helps simulate repairing the ship, but doubles as an item that can be stored in the engine compartment.</p>

<p><strong>Display value</strong></p>

<p>This A-Wing is relatively&nbsp;accurate for its time. Although the top is basically covered in stickers, they are optional and the model could still hold its own without them. That being said, they add quite a lot to the look of the set. The ones on the side&nbsp;faithfully recreate the battle damage present on&nbsp;this&nbsp;<a href=""https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/8d/A-wing_DICE.png/revision/latest?cb=20161021230115"">particular model</a>, although the panel detailing combines other models.&nbsp;Some details have never been seen before, nor after on a regular classic RZ-1 A-Wing (For example, the straps around the cockpit or the red dots in the front). Some notable inaccuracies include the thickness and straight angle of the rear fins and the disproportionate gap situated in the front. However, for what they are&nbsp;worth, the details of this set are marvellous, considering it&nbsp;is, at the time of writing, almost 9 years old.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing revolutionary about the build. It is very simple (brick on brick, in fact), but the shape of the final product is satisfying, although way blockier than the real thing.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I consider 2013 to be the beginning of the &quot;Modern Era&quot; of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. In 2013, LEGO began polishing their older designs and introduced new ones, some still in use to this day. Including 3 quite valuable figures in such a small set is uncommon, however welcome. The A-Wing pilot is spectacular. His torso and legs are very richly decorated and the quality of the white printing is better than some that comes out today. Admiral Ackbar is such a unique figure. His torso is also appropriately detailed, and I love the inclusion of a coffee mug - classic LEGO humour. Han Solo is particularly notable: the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6029862"">torso</a> first seen here is still in use to this day!</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>My nostalgia might be blinding me, but I consider this set to be fantastic. It is certainly a classic and I recommend picking it up if you can find it at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Box art was nothing special just the ship flying in space with some explosions and blaster bolts. The instructions were clear and had 59 pages. It also came with a two-sided paper that shows the minifigs and sets, that came out that year. Btw:&nbsp;I have reviewed almost all the first batch of sets of 2013 (sadly I can&#39;t review 75005 Rancor Pit, because I don&#39;t own it).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with three minifigs, and one of them is unique. The minifigures are: Admiral Ackbar, who appears in four sets, Han Solo, Reddish Brown Legs with Holster Pattern, Vest with Pockets, who appears in two sets and Rebel Pilot A-wing (Open Helmet, Dark Green Jumpsuit, Frown/Scared) (Arvel Crynyd), who is unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set has 177 pieces, and there is some good New Dark Red, and White pieces for MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: This set comes with three numbered bags. In the first bag you build the minifigs, and the base of the ship, and the motors. In the second one you build the front of the ship, and the part between the motors. The third one contains the rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall this set is very good the only downside in it is the playability, because there are no Imperials. The minifigs are good, and there is three of them! The value of money is okay, the price was $25 when it came out. There is some good parts and the build was pretty simple. Overall I would give this set a 4.97/5.</p>
