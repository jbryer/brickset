The Z-95 is well-known in the expanded universe and it looks accurate enough, at least compared to certain variants of the fighter. It doesn't have many details and it's rough around the edges, but I like it anyway.

 I just picked up this set along with the 75002 AT-RT on Christmas at the lego store. As you can see, this Z-95 headhunter is based off the one in the Clone wars TV series not EU. It was seen in seasons 4 +5 of the show and this one was used during the battle of&nbsp; Umbara.</p>
<p>
 Box/Instructions</p>
<p>
 The box is suprisingly pretty small for a $50(US) set. (Lego is probably saving cardboard) It is green with the 2013 Yoda logo in the upper right corner. The back shows the play features but is missing the pictures of the other sets in this wave. The instructions are average sized but, unfortunately mine was folded. It also has a sticker sheet for the engines and the back canopy.</p>
<p>
 Parts</p>
<p>
 I don`t think there are any new parts in this set. There are a lot of useful dark red, white and black slopes and curves used for the front and body. This is a pretty good parts pack.</p>
<p>
 Minifigures</p>
<p>
 This set contains 3 minifigures- 2 which are unique are exclusive to this set. The 501 Clone Trooper is the same as the one from the 75002 AT-RT and has a new helmet mold. Personally, I like the new phase 2 clone wars helmet better than the old episode 3 one. The 501 pilot has a nice printed helmet as well as a new torso. I wish lego added hoses to the helmet. Pong Krell is excellent and very detailed minifig. His head/arm piece is very similar to lord garmadon`s and his body and legs are dark orange.</p>
<p>
 The build</p>
<p>
 The build is pretty straight forward and is divided into 4 bags 1-body 2-front 3-engines 4-wings. For some reason the 3 minifigs are divided into different bags. The build involves alot of snot and technic pieces to give it a sleek look.</p>
<p>
 The completed model</p>
<p>
 The completed result is alot bigger than I thought. It is very sturdy and swooshable. You can open the back to store weapons and it has a neat technic shooter function on the bottom. It also has foldable landing gear. I wish lego added some umbarans or droids to fight against.</p>
<p>
 Summary</p>
<p>
 In conclusion this is a great set for the minifigs and the ship itself although it is very short on the price-per-piece ratio by about 150 parts. I would recommend getting it sale.<br />

<p>First, an admission: I&#39;m actually more familiar with this craft from the 90s Lucasarts Videogames X-Wing and TIE fighter than I am from the &#39;official&#39; (Clone Wars?) representation of the model, so when I saw the shape at first it felt to me to be a little &#39;off&#39;, particularly with the inclusion of the stubby front &#39;wings&#39; on the nose.</p>

<p>However, I did enjoy building the model, which comes with retractable landing skids on both the back (just beside the engines) and on the front nose, as well as with a launching bomb bay.&nbsp; On the downside, however, tit (yet again uses tickers to portray the engine intakes.</p>

"rkc62","2013-07-28T22:03:54.04Z","Great as a Star Wars kit or a part source","<p>This is a great looking model with some unexpected bonuses.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Separate bags for each stage made the build much more enjoyable. There are stickers, but the model looks fine without them…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>USD13.40 per part looks bad, but this is actually a great source of parts - those lovely long dark red curves are hard to find but will add to many MOCs, and many of the parts are quite large - the white compound curves underneath, the huge wing pieces and the engines. I didn't expect the missile launcher either - I thought from the box art it was a typical technic flick and launch like on so many Star Wars sets, but this is a serious spring-loaded unit that can be assembled with a remote trigger on another part of the model.…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Standard Star Wars minifigs plus ""Pong Krell"" which is some sort of enormous Wookie looking creature…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fairly straightforward except for the missile launching mechanism…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This was much bigger than I expected - I had just built one SW kit that cost a similar amount and one that cost a bit more, and the Z-95 dwarfed both of them. It is very playable with retracting landing gear, opening cockpit, hatch etc plus the missile launcher, and the design practically begs you to swoosh - you can't help it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I bought it for the parts, but I was pleasantly surprised by this model - recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

"Tar_Domo","2014-08-31T13:18:26.417Z","PONG KRELL And A Great Ship","<p>This set is one of the Umbarran theme sets released in 2013. The others were AT-RT and Umbarran MHC (Mobile Heavy Cannon).</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Box is quite big and the instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>In the ship there is not a lot of exclusive parts but a few really interesting ones. Most of the parts are either white or red.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures: Pong Krell, 501st legion Clone Trooper and Clone Pilot (501st legion also). The main reason I bought this set was Pong Krell. His headpiece is great and he is a good add to my Jedi collection. 501st legion Clone is also a good idea (an other 501st legion Clone Trooper appears in the AT-RT set), but it&acute;s hard to get any kind of &quot;legion&quot; of them if there is just one clone in the set. I would prefer one or two more 501st legion clone troopers to this set. It would be good also thinking about value for money, because this is a little pricey (65 euros in Finland). 501st Clone Pilot is great, new character. He has a complete new helmet.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>Building this was quite easy. The too wings were of course a little bit repetitive but that wasn&acute;t too bad thing.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>Headhunter looks cool on display and is okay for play also. It&acute;s not breaking too easily and if it breaks, it&acute;s not that hard to fix. I have to say it&acute;s quite big, bigger than I thought.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>This is a good set with interesting minifigures and cool ship. I recommend it for all SW collectors, not just CW collectors,&nbsp;because the ship looks so cool on display.</p>

"iwybs","2019-06-09T05:59:33.83Z","Just what I always wanted ... right?","<p>When my older brother got the 7140 X-wing Fighter for his birthday in 1999, I got the 7141 Naboo Fighter for mine.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;jealous.&nbsp; The X-wing appeared in all three original films, destroyed two Death Stars, and delivered Luke Skywalker to a date with destiny on Dagobah and again on Cloud City.&nbsp; The Naboo Fighter, by contrast, couldn&#39;t take a single hit without blowing up, and a whiny little kid could fly it.&nbsp; I promptly set about making an X-wing of my own from spare parts, but soon gave up on that when it was clear I didn&#39;t have enough parts to build anything halfway decent without tearing up the Naboo Fighter.&nbsp; (Much as I loved to hate it, I wasn&#39;t going to do that.)&nbsp; The makeshift X-wing soon turned into a &quot;T-wing,&quot; and before long my character flew that ship into the sunset and disappeared so I could break it up for parts, because it too was super lame.&nbsp; Five years later, I did lots of extra chores around the house to buy the 4502 X-wing Fighter as soon as I possibly could, establishing decisive air superiority over my brother&#39;s X-wing for over a decade.</p>

<p>Last fall, I persuaded myself to buy a used copy (without minifigs) of the 75004 Z-95 Headhunter because it reminded me of that long-ago T-wing, with its simple, lightweight variation on the X-wing fuselage and its lack of opening wings and a droid bay.</p>

<p>First, the good points - - - It matches the onscreen source material quite well, and it has a good set of play features: fully retractable three-point landing gear, a large spring shooter that drops from the bottom of the aft fuselage, an opening cockpit, and a small cargo area in the back.&nbsp; The back of the fuselage has a nice amount of greebling, and overall the fuselage is nicely shaped and smoothly finished, with relatively simple construction techniques.&nbsp; &nbsp;The technique used to build a simple, lightweight nose is particularly nice.&nbsp; The finished model is surprisingly large, surpassing the 9493 and 75218 X-wings in both length and width, but it weighs much less and is correspondingly more swooshable if you can find a grip you like.&nbsp; As a parts pack, you get a good amount of large and small wedge plates, headlight bricks, 10x1 curved slopes, 6x2 wedge bricks (upright and inverted), quite a few 4-wide drums, and two 3-wide rocket cones.&nbsp; Only one part isn&#39;t very useful for moccing, and that&#39;s the large red wedge that forms the top of the nose.&nbsp; Overall, the Headhunter would be a great parts pack if it wasn&#39;t overpriced by ten to fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>But despite all those good things, I can&#39;t help but feel like the ship remains just as lame compared to the X-wing as my makeshift childhood T-wing was.&nbsp; The opening wings and rear droid bay add so much playability and complexity to the X-wing that it doesn&#39;t need gimmicks like a spring shooter stuffed into the aft fuselage to make it interesting - - - everything needed for a fun set with a cool build is baked right into the source material.&nbsp; The Z-95 was never more than a poor man&#39;s imitation X-wing in the Expanded Universe, conceptualized as it was as a sort of wannabe ship to capitalize on the X-wing&#39;s popularity out-of-universe.&nbsp; Out-of-universe, the Z-95 toy is the same - a cheaper ship put on shelves between the 2012 and 2015 X-wings for the sake of consumers who wouldn&#39;t pay the extra ten bucks to get 9493 instead.</p>

<p>I guess this is more about the X-wing than it is about the Z-95, so I should stop.&nbsp; Go ahead and get this if you really want it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a faithful representation of the source material with a good build and lots of play features.&nbsp; If you&#39;ve been thinking about picking up a used copy and you&#39;re on the fence about it, skip it and get 75218 instead.</p>

Fantastic minifigures&nbsp;Pong Krell&nbsp;has a unique model with fantastic details and the 501st clone pilot looks incredible and a 501st&nbsp;clone trooper is always welcome. The build is very fun but somewhat simple so you can get to playing quickly. It&#39;s very durable and I&#39;ve had no issues with pieces falling off, even when playing rigorously.
