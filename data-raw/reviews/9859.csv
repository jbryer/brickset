"DarthZared","2013-01-03T05:46:34.293Z","The Killer Rancor!","When I first heard news of the January 2013 sets I wasn't really that excited over the Rancor Pit because I wasn't really bothered about Jabba's Palace. However, when I received the Palace for Christmas I found out that the Rancor Pit was compatible with Jabba's Palace so I had to buy it.<div><br></div><div>The build is relatively straightforward, starting with the figures and the rancor, then the gate, the floor and the corners of the pit. There are some decent parts in unusual grey and tan colours so the set was nice and interesting.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigures are as usual the main reason I bought the set. Even the least exciting figure in the set is only featured in two sets, which is the Gammorean Guard with his new sandwich board and updated features since his last appearance a few years ago. Having two guards from Jabba's Palace and the Rancor Pit really help because it adds a sense of extra protection over Jabba. The second minifigure is Luke Skywalker, featuring the new torso design first seen last summer in the new Desert Skiff. I love this figure because I never had a Jedi Knight Luke before and I believe his angry face printing is new making him even better. The third figure is Malakili, who was the Rancor keeper. The way the figure manages to capture Malakili's love for the Rancor is very commendable, and I am glad Lego decided to give him a weapon too. The final minifigure (if he is a minifigure) that is the main star of the show and the reason that probably 90% of people will buy the set is the Rancor. For over 10 years fans have been waiting for a Rancor, and when it happens, they really shine. The figure is amazing, and includes arm, finger and jaw articulation. His evil looks are identical to the film, and he's my favourite figure of the January wave. However, I have one slight problem with his size. In Return of the Jedi, Luke manages to stop the Rancor by knocking the gate onto his head, squashing him. Sadly in this set Lego have not made the gate large enough to squash the Rancor enough, as the gate only drops about a centimeter before the Rancor gets in the way. I guess this problem could not be solved because if they made the set any larger it would not have been compatible with Jabba's Palace and it would have been around £100.</div><div><br></div><div>The aforementioned compatibility with 9516 gives a whole new life to the set, and I'd love to see more of these kinds of sets to extend the playability. Overall, if you have set 9516, I mark this as a must-buy set for the pure fun that you get from both sets. If you do not have 9516, I still think this is a great set for anyone, whether they'd be a minifig collector, a Star Wars fan or just a builder looking for a nice set to build.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"zipsforbananas","2013-01-03T07:57:00.6Z","Forget the pit, it's the Rancor! Awesome, but overpriced.","<p>It's been a long wait! There were rumours, there were pictures, and finally we can buy the Rancor pit! This is going to be the most mixed review I think I've written because the set is a real enigma, brilliant in some ways, poor in others. But whatever the weaknesses, the strengths are enough that it's a must have, even if grudgingly.</p><p>The <b>figures</b> are clearly the focus of the set, and they don't disappoint.<br><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;is as he was in the Desert Skiff set (9496), well printed but not all that spectacular. The dark grey torso still seems a little odd, and true to the films he doesn't yet have his lightsabre so we don't get the benefit of the relatively rare green shaft, but I don't recall seeing the long bone he's holding instead all that often so it's a good substitute!<br>The <b>Gamorrean Guard</b>&nbsp;is the same as the Jabba's Palace (9516) figure, and let's be honest, the moulding and printing were so fine and detailed, the colours were all just right, he was superb so we all wanted more than one! And he's holding a turkey leg; I thought he fell in by mistake so I'm not sure why he's trying to feed the Rancor, hey ho!<br><b>Malakili</b>&nbsp;is the figure out of these I was most anticipating (apart from the chance to own a second Gamorrean Guard!), and he's a good'n too. His legs are plain, but the olive green is nice; he's got a standard brown hood; his torso is printed to give him a nice pot belly; and his face is double sided with a normal expression on one side and the about-to-cry look for when his beloved pet is dispatched on the other. His staff has the new clip pieces at either end; they seem a little odd to me, not the greatest piece in the world, but they're new so any MOCer will be glad for them and to see what they can be used for (Not that I expect many MOCers to be buying this set...).</p><p>And the reason for the pit: <b>the Rancor</b>!<br>We should have a moment's silence for the failure of the brick built CUUSOO Rancor (perhaps a brick built one here would have bumped the part count up enough for the price...), but only a moment as this moulded version is superb! It's a slight shame that his legs aren't articulated, but he's been given a fantastically menacing forward-lean so it's okay. And even without that he's actually an 18 piece model (19 with the chain)! The articulation in his arms, 2 fingers on each hand, and his mouth make him so fun to pose, move, attack and eat figures with, etc. He's just so good! And therein lies the quandry - do you buy this whole set just for the Rancor? Of course, but with a good dose of begrudgingliness!<br><br></p><p>The actual&nbsp;<b>pit</b>&nbsp;is mixed bag. The build is simple (so simple that I managed to do it on LDD from the photos alone before the set arrived) and there's a reasonable mix of parts, but a lot of people will be annoyed at the 5 LURPs that give the set some of it's impressive height. There are no especially impressive techniques involved, just nice building of a sturdy bases and good layering and&nbsp;strengthening&nbsp;of a frame-like structure. The hinge that allows the door to swing out is most welcome and opens the set up nicely for play inside, giving it a few different looks for display too.</p><p>The <b>playability</b>&nbsp;is by far the best feature of it. The main hinge and door give needed variety and let you release the Rancor. There are round trans-red tiles on either side of the main door (one by the small door in when the main door is hinged out) for Luke to aim a (conspicuously absent) rock at, and the small amount of Technic lets you drop the main door onto the Rancor, a-la the scene in the film. There are also a few features to let imagination go wild, with secret compartments within a pillar and under a lift-off trapdoor. And the tiny safe area behind the small door has a key, bucket and pitchfork, all perfect for Malakili to tend his 'pet' with.<br><br></p><p>The <b>combination with Jabba's Palace (9516)</b>&nbsp;only adds to the playability. The sets do look a little odd one on top of the other, especially with the entrance tower attached, but that really doesn't matter for play! Now the sliding trapdoor in the floor of the palace makes sense - poor Oola! Jabba's throne slides perfectly forward to view the carnage, and each of the Rancor scenes can be acted out in full.</p><p>However there are some quite puzzling problems with this. Though the two sets have clearly been designed to fit together, they don't seem to do so all that well. Putting them together stops the back of Jabba's palace swinging out, and somehow I expected them to fit the other way round, with the Rancor's door in front or behind Jabba, rather than to the side (counting the studs in the sneak preview photos left us expecting that, but it's still a bit of a disappointment).<br>The biggest weakness by far though is that the palace fits so perfectly on top that it stops the main door from opening! You can't operate it without swinging it out, and then the folks on top (whose view was already impeded by bricks going across the grilles) won't be able to see it at all! And either way round that you put the palace, on the one side the trapdoor gets in the way, and on the other the entrance tower does, so the door has to be swung out a long way.<br><br></p><p>Finally, the real killer aspect: <b>the price</b>. Putting aside the plainness of the build and parts, and the somewhat strange weaknesses in the way the palace and pit fit together, it's a really good set with good playability and great figures, especially the immense Rancor. The only significant problem with the set is the price. The US price is actually quite good of course, by I'm in the UK and have been stung by a change in the currency sign and not in the numbers!<br>There is not a single angle that £59.99 looks good or justifiable from.&nbsp;Converting the US price, it should have been £40, and for the piece count at the Star Wars rate of &gt;10p per piece it should the same.&nbsp;Comparing it to the sets it came out with (the £25, 177 piece, 3 figure A-Wing, and the £40, 426 piece, 6 figure (plus a Tauntaun) Battle of Hoth) is hard as they didn't have a Rancor, but I can't for the life of me see how it is more than the Hoth set! It has less pieces and half the number of figures. I'd say that balancing the loss of pieces and figures against the gain of the Rancor leaves a fair price of, again, £40.<br>As with the overpriced palace Lego are taking liberties, knowing that most fans will bite the bullet for the sake of the fantastic figure. I fear for the Sailbarge coming out later in 2013, but I know that like the palace and pit I'll be buying it regardless. An object's worth is simply what someone is willing to pay; £35 is about right for the set and figures, so I guess I have paid £25 for the Rancor!<br>(The only slight justification I can imagine is that making a profit from splitting the set and selling it on on eBay is going to be hard. Perhaps that practice has finally bitten back!)<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The Rancor! What a beast! Vicious and fearsome, it's delightfully playable and poseable</li><li>The other figures are nice, particularly Malakili and another Gamorrean Guard</li><li>The playablility of the set is good with a couple of nice extra features</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This one truly is a con! The price is extortionate at £60; that's effectively £20 extra for the Rancor in a set worth £40&nbsp;in every other way of calculating it</li><li>Some mystifying moments when you combine it with the designed-to-go-together palace and find things that don't go together!</li></ul>
<p>It's everything we hoped and feared! Such a great Rancor, the other figures are the usual excellent standard, and there's bags of playability. But all of the predicted problems when the palace is added are there, and the predictions of price were spot on too - looks like £40, bet it'll be £60! If your mind isn't already made up that's the only thing you have to consider. Do you need the Rancor enough to effectively pay £20 for the&nbsp;privilege? If you bought the palace last year then you have my sympathy, because you will probably have to say yes.<br>Still, it could be worse, because now you have a Rancor, and that's just so awesome!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,1
"Nesquik","2013-01-06T15:29:26.273Z","Ran-con Pit","When I built and reviewed 9516 <i>Jabba's Palace</i>, one of the first thoughts that came to mind was ""Why isn't the rancor pit here?"". I already knew that the product would be released separately, but it was only after putting the model and the price side-by-side that I began to realise the scale of greed that has slipping through TLG's suits and spreadsheets.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Afterall, why sell a famous movie scene in one product when... well, it could be divided into two?&nbsp;In 75005 <i>Rancor Pit</i>, we witness one of the growing traditions in the Lego licensed themed universe; excellent figures that cloud over a token - and not particularly exciting - model.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is one of the key problems with <i>Rancor Pit</i>, as although the figures look stunning on display, they are not designed with the same degree of playability that you would expect of a product this price and age range. I'm amazed the designers overlooked how Luke uses the large bone to fix the rancors mouth open (and escape his clutch), as the bone included in this product is far too large in scale. There is no way to lock it in the beast's jaw, which is downright ridiculous.</div><div><br></div><div>The layout of the pit itself also lacks authenticity, that which is normally of a high standard when you view the detail of the original trilogy starfighters, for example. Why does the rock pillar have a secret opening? And why is the keeper's door to the side of the rancor's door - not <i>behind </i>it?</div><div><br></div><div>When you add these facts together and the general simplicity of the model itself, you have to wonder what purpose the pit serves. It is too small to play with properly (or convincingly), and to apply it to Jabba's Palace, you need additional support around the former building. This brings me to my original point; both products would have worked better as a single product.</div><div><br></div><div>But the figures themselves are immediate collector's items - the rancor in particular featuring multiple limbs, excellent quality plastic and a nice jaw piece. The rancor guard isn't a character that adds playability, but again, is present to appeal to Star Wars collector's rather than children. The Grimorian Guard and Luke make excellent additions.</div><div><br></div><div>At 380 pieces, this product is slightly better value than Jabba's Palace, but with the compromise of featuring less figures and a, frankly, disappointing 'pit'. The chances are though that if you have £60 to spend, you'll bet better off purchasing the Rancor Pit since it has more playability. Jabba's Palace, while containing an array of spectacular figures, is merely a showcase that will appeal to older fans who can appreciate the characters and environment in brick-form, rather than wishing to play with the product.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, while it's saddening that TLG have sought to put their business-brains before value and playability, we do at least get the rancor finally in all his glory. He and the other figures are not worth a whopping £60, but if you fancy yourself a challenge, then the included pit could easily be modified to your own interpretation of this classic movie scene.</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, I must apologise for being critical when it comes to value and business models. As a Lego fan for almost two decades, it's frustrating to witness how licensed themes have, arguably, both saved the company and damaged it in the long run.</div>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,2
"Chills","2013-01-08T14:21:58.363Z","""Master Luke, you're standing on....!""","<p>When I saw the first pictures of this set I knew it was be on my must-have list, and since Jabba's Palace ended up in my collection for Christmas I knew I'd end up getting the Rancor Pit soon. A trip to the local Lego store and I was able to grab the last one in stock. Overall I am pleased with the set, it is a good addition to the collection and has some cool minifigures; however there are some short comings that pop out at you.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off I have to mention the minifigures, especially the Rancor. Wow! Lego did a great job with the detail for this classic Star Wars monster. The body has the armored back, the tiny eyes, stubby toes on the feet, and even Lego studs on the shoulders for MOCing up a saddle for Rancor riders in the expanded universe. The jaw, arms, hands, and claws all have to be added. The jaw is large, and can hold most of a minifigure. The hands have two large fingers each that help grab whatever happens to be unlucky enough to be within reach of the Rancor, and the claws are the standard pointy pieces, but in a sandy-gold color. The creature is also well balanced, so it doesn't fall forward when holding a minifigure.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The other four minifigures are Luke, who has a nicely detailed torso and two faces, one happy and one worried; Malakili, the Rancor keeper, looks great with his chubby belly, a hood, and a spiked staff. However it looks like Lego used the same legs as the Gamorrean guard sans printing; but he should have had dark brown pants. The Gamorrean is the same from Jabba's Palace, and exquisitely detailed, both the torso/head piece and the legs. There's no weapon for this guy, he's the one that gets eaten by the Rancor. The last minifigure is a skeleton with bent arms, which makes it unique to this set, I believe. <br></li><li>Pro 3: The Lego designers had a conundrum, the obvious reason for this set was to showcase the Rancor, but the pit also needed playability. How does one put in features in a hole in the ground? Well, I think they did a pretty decent job. The main gate is there, plus the smaller door for people. There's also a hidden section in one pillar for Luke, which is probably supposed to be where he hid when the Rancor first appeared. In addition there's a secret space under the floor to hold an extra key and bone. Not bad for this set, in my opinion.</li><li>Pro 4: This set is decent as a stand-alone set, but it does better with Jabba's Palace 9516. It attaches easily to that set, and the trap door drops hapless victims right down into the pit, and Jabba's dais slides forward to watch through the grate. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Ok, I'm going to get this out of the way: the cost is pretty high for the number of pieces, even with the awesome Rancor. I know this is a big gripe with everyone about this set, but it looks like all set prices are up a bit for 2013; still this set rates low on the value scale.<br></li><li>Con 2: The second issue I have with this set is how it connects to the Palace. The main gate can't lift, it just hits the bottom of the throne room. I think this design flaw is worse than the high price of this set. Lego, if you're going to make 2 separate sets to go together you shouldn't limit the functions of one set this much. Lego should have extended the side that holds the main gate out a few more studs so that it would clear the palace when raised. Also, the tower of the palace has to be detached to put the throne room above the pit. Lego should have had some supports extending from the pit to hold the tower in its real place. <br></li></ul>
<p>As I said before, overall I'm pretty pleased with this set. The Rancor is fantastic, and the other minifigures are pretty cool, too. All good additions to your collection. The pit itself is pretty cool; it has some interesting parts in unique colors, mainly the sandy ones. It has decent playability, but the build was a bit quick. It looks like I'll be MOCing up an extension for the gate section so it raises when under the palace and also a support for the tower.<br></p><p>Unless you're really turned off by the 2 cons I listed I would definitely get this set. Its not perfect, but it is quite cool. And coolest of all you get a highly-detailed Rancor! With a little work is a perfect addition to Jabba's Palace.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
"GeneralJabba","2013-01-23T19:39:14.637Z","75005 Rancor Pit","<p>With the opening ~40 minutes of Return of the Jedi being one of my favourite movie segments of all time (you may have guessed from my username), I knew I would have to get all the new/redesigned LEGO sets from it when I first heard about them. I bought Jabba's Palace last August and received the Desert Skiff for Christmas, and neither of them disappointed. My anticipation for the Rancor Pit was high from the moment I read about it, and my love for the other two Jabba sets boosted it even more. And even then, the Rancor Pit still managed to surpass my expectations.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Needless to say, this set has some very interesting parts, although most of them do happen to be part of the Rancor. The ""5 high rock slopes"" (part 54782) may be viewed as great pieces by some or as cheat pieces by others, and although I can certainly understand both points of view, I love them, so I was very happy to get 5 of them in the set. The portcullis piece is completely unique, and fits the purpose of being the Rancor's gate just perfectly. Another new piece (although not unique to this set) is the ""clip with hole"" (part 11090). Two of these are used in the making of Malakili's gaffi stick, and despite them not being particularly interesting, they, like the portcullis, fit their purpose well and I can see them becoming very useful pieces both for MOCs and future LEGO sets. The set also features a nice little bucket and pitchfork, both of which are also welcome additions.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The minifigures of this set really are top-notch. Three of the four of them (Rancor, Malakili and Luke Skywalker) are completely unique to this set, which is always an attraction in LEGO sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Luke is pretty much exactly the same as the one in the Desert Skiff, but minus the lightsabre and plus a double sided face and bone. His hair doesn't quite cover the second face at the back, but in the grand scheme of things this really doesn't matter to me.</div><div><br></div><div>The unfortunate Gamorrean Guard is exactly the same as the one in Jabba's Palace, but this is certainly not something to gripe about; the redesigned Gamorrean Guard is an outstanding minifig, and easily makes my top 5. I would have liked this Gamorrean to have come with an axe like the one in 9516, but for the purposes of movie accuracy I can understand why.</div><div><br></div><div>Malakili is another one who is completely unique to this set (and chances are will stay that way) and another very welcome addition. The torso printing gives him a nice bunch of chest hair and some flab, so he does look just like in the movie. His head is double sided, with one side being very serious and the other being very sad. The sad side features a tear coming from one of his eyes, meant to represent him after his beloved Rancor has been killed. His gaffi stick is an interesting design, utilising two of the new ""clip with hole"" pieces.</div><div><h4>The Rancor</h4></div><div>I thought I'd give the eponymous Rancor it's own little segment in this review, seeing as it is just too incredible to be placed with the ordinary minifigs. It is certainly the star of the set, and a very satisfying creature to behold. Even though I had watched countless YouTube reviews of this set before mine arrived, I still wasn't anticipating just how massive the Rancor is. It is seriously HUGE. The arms, wrists and middle two fingers on each hand are articulated, and the jaw opens and closes to consume its hapless prey. Minifigures without elaborate molds, such as Luke, fit into its mouth all the way and let the jaw close fully on them, and I discovered that if you put them in feet-first and then open the mouth again it creates a nice vomitting effect. Other minifigs you may want the Rancor to feast on, such as Oola and the Gamorrean, only fit in partially; however this is more than enough given I wasn't even expecting to be able to put a minifigure even partially into its mouth. The legs and head do not move, but the Rancor does fit well on studs (although there isn't an awful lot of room in the pit itself to put him). Admittedly the big bone which uke holds doesn't fit in the Rancor's mouth, but I have found that the smaller bones in the hidden compartment work just fine. All things considered, the Rancor figure is a true testament to LEGO's capabilities and an outstanding feature.</div>
<h4>The Build</h4><div>If you're wanting an elaborate build, then I'd suggest you look somewhere else. Let's face it: it is a pit with four columns and a gate. There really isn't a lot to make overly exciting about the build. This is a set you buy for the minifigures and the playability, not for an intriguing build. However the build did still take some time and I found the contents of bag 1 (the gate and function) very pleasing to put together. Contrary to what I thought when I first saw pictures of the set, the build doesn't actually get overly repetitive, which is another plus.</div>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4><div>Despite the build not being an A+ experience, the completed model looka fantastic and the playability is great thanks to all the different functions and features LEGO has added. Firstly, the gate section folds out 90 degrees to open up the pit a bit more so as to make more room for a fight/execution scene. The gate slides up and a clever technic part can be pushed in to lock the gate in place at any stage of its ascension. The same technic part can then be pulled out to drop the portcullis, just like in the movie when Luke throws Bidlo Kwerve's skull at the button, although admittedly because of the way the Rancor's body is positioned it is hard to make it look accurate. There is a hidden compartment in the floor at the front of the pit, containing bones and a spare key, the lid of which can be lifted by way of a skull on it acting as a handle. The skull can also be used to act out the&nbsp;aforementioned&nbsp;death of the Rancor, so it is a clever double-function. There is a gate to the side of the main gate which leads back to Malakili's equipment room where the pitchfork, key and bucket are kept. Finally, one of the ""5 high rock slopes"" can swing out, making room for a hidden minifigure inside. This feature is supposed to represent the part of the pit which Luke initially attempts to hide in before being caught by the Rancor. Overall, a very good completed model with a swag of playability.</div><h4>Connection to Jabba's Palace</h4><div>There are four spikes on top of the pillars of the Rancor Pit which allow it to connect to Jabba's Palace by means of four holes on the latter's bottom. I'll be honest: the way LEGO has you connect them, with the gate underneath the entrance to the throne room, does look a little odd. Also, the positioning of two of the spikes make it so that the back of Jabba's Palace cannot swing out, which is very disappointing. The most disappointing aspect of LEGO's connection however is that there is no way for the portcullis itself to raised without turning it out while Jabba's Palace is on top. Considering LEGO's usual care and attention to detail, I was very surprised by this effective reduction of playability and awkward look. Despite this, the trapdoor function still works very well and Jabba's dais sliding forward to watch the spectacle&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;in the pit still works fine so its not all bad.</div><p></p><h4>Improvements/Modifications</h4><div>As I said previously, the way that LEGO has you fit the two sets together does look a little odd. The back of Jabba's Palace cannot be swung out, and the gate also cannot go up without it itself being swung out. Because of this, I decided to modify my pit a little so as to make it more playable when the two sets are combined. Firstly, I removed both the spikes closest to the gate, and then moved the front spikes one row each towards the middle (front left spike goes one to the right, front right spike goes one to the left). What this does is allow the pit to be put underneath Jabba's Palace so that the gate is underneath the swinging back of the Palace. Removing the back two spikes lets the swinging back swing out in order to let the gate be put up without turning it out itself while underneath the Palace. Although the tower still has nothing beneath it, the playability and overall look of the throne room and pit are increased greatly. I recommend you try this because the playset really does both look better and become more playable when modified in this way,</div><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>In summary, I am very pleased with the Rancor Pit, despite it being a little too&nbsp;pricey&nbsp;for my - and I imagine everyone else's - liking. When combined with Jabba's Palace, it makes for what is in my opinion the greatest LEGO playset ever to have been released, especially if you make my suggested modifications. This really is a must buy set for all LEGO Star Wars fans.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"Sandman0","2013-02-20T18:38:38.02Z","Could have been so much more...","<p>I bought this for my son because he has 9516 (Jabba's Palace). It just feels like Lego fell flat with this one. The minifigs (including the rancor!) are awesome, and plentiful (5 total in this set). <br></p><p>Construction of the pit was a bit tedious, simply because the instructions were not well done. I think of all the Lego sets that I have built over the last 30 years or so, this and 9516 had the most issues with quality of the instructions. It's like there was no QC done on the build steps, there are several points where it would have made the build easier if they had reversed two steps, i.e. push this plate against the other one, and then attach with this piece, which is not consistent with the Lego modular building philosophy (method?).<br></p><p>The pit itself seems to be a bit short, especially if you want to recreate the scene where Luke kills the rancor by crushing it with the gate (the gate isn't tall enough really).</p><p>The pit also is not long enough. There should be more to it. I don't know that they should have extended the area beyond the gate, but Lego surely should have made the pit about twice the size it is. I get that they are trying to keep the part count down to keep the cost down, but take a look at this and tell me that Lego didn't miss an opportunity here.</p><p>This is what you get in the box:</p><p>[img] http://i.imgur.com/rCR9tO3l.jpg [/img]</p><p>This is what it looks like combined with 9516:<br></p><p>[img] http://i.imgur.com/8yqKqDxl.jpg [/img]<br></p><p>And this is what a bit of modification gets you:<br></p><p>[img] http://i.imgur.com/S5humV5l.jpg [/img]</p><p>[img] http://i.imgur.com/NiJokrGl.jpg [/img]</p><p>If you boxed up the modified version it'd add maybe $20-25 to the cost of the set (I got a second rancor pit on bricklink without minifigs for ~$25, so I'm guessing it would add about that), but look at the difference in the results!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Rancor!<br></li><li>Appropriate number of minifigs for what it is.<br></li><li>Good color layout for combining with Jabba's Palace.</li><li>Massive playability with the addition of 9516 (I can't really see anyone buying this and NOT getting 9516).<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Too short.<br></li><li>Too small.</li><li>When combined with 9516 the layout is all wrong, you cannot open the gate without swinging that wall out.</li><li>Price per part is pretty stiff.</li><li>Instructions are not good.<br></li></ul>
<p>Looking at the modded Jabba's Palace you see what this set SHOULD have been. Personally I was more than happy to shell out the ~$25 for another copy of this set without the minifigs to mod this and Jabba's palace for my son. He LOVES it, he spends hours reenacting the entire scene from RotJ. <br></p><p>Overall I'd recommend this set if you already have 9516, really just want the rancor, or plan on modding it like I did.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"sudorum","2013-07-29T15:14:45.357Z","No Wonder the Rancor is Angry","<p>It could be so much better. This is really the set's major malfunction. Now of course it comes with the great array of mini figures&nbsp;that Lego Star Wars is expected to have, but unfortunately their inclusion is the only redeeming factor here. &nbsp;My gripe is not so much with the set itself, but how it relates to its significantly better half--Jabba's Palace. Despite reading other reviews describing how the gate to the pit could not raise when the Palace is laid atop the pit structure, I couldn't help but be disappointed by this sad truth when viewing it in person. The gate can indeed raise if you swing out the wall from which it resides in, but the sight is a bit awkward looking and feels like it was added as an afterthought. While still on the topic of the gate, I think the combined structure would be improved if the gate faced the same direction as the exterior of Jabba's Palace. Instead, the gate can only be viewed from a side vantage point, which again lends the building a poor appearance.</p><div>However, what I find to be the most unforgivable mistake is the set's failed inclusion of a support structure for the tower portion of Jabba's Palace. So if you want to connect the tower to the main structure of Jabba's Palace while it is resting on top of the Rancor Pit, the tower simply hangs in thin air. It looks terrible and worst of all-- unfinished. You could always disconnect the tower from Jabba's main sanctuary, but this formation still looks incomplete. It's really a no win situation.&nbsp;There actually is a good bit of playability with this set, including such features as hidden floor panels and hiding places. And it does enhance the playability of Jabba's Palace by providing a space for Luke Skywalker to fall down from.&nbsp;My advice would be to buy this set if you really don't care about anything I've mentioned above. I knew that the set wasn't perfect when I bought it, but the allure of the Rancor and a new addition to Jabba's Palace was just too difficult to ignore.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,2
"Dragon_Master_48","2013-08-24T19:02:07.113Z","The LEGO Star Wars Rancor Makes a Smashing Deubt!","<p><strong>75005 Rancor Pit</strong> is a continuation of the recent&nbsp;""revamped"" versions&nbsp;of Episode VI sets centered around the Jabba's Palace/Pit of Carkoon scenes; compared to the other sets (9496 Desert Skiff, 9516 Jabba's Palace, and 75020 Jabba's Sail Barge) the Rancor Pit is the only completely new one (the other ones being based at least partly on previous sets).</p><p>Like the Skiff to the Sail Barge, the Rancor Pit can also connect to Jabba's Palace (although, since I don't own the other set, I haven't had a change to actually try it out for myself). I believe that this set functions fine on its own, although others may not share my opinion.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigures: Luke Skywalker, Gamorrean Guard, and Malakili.</li><li>The amazing Rancor, the main focus of this set, obviously. :P</li><li>Hinge allows for set to ""separate,"" as you can see in other pictures.</li><li>Plenty of other features, including (or being, rather)&nbsp;two hidden compartments and a gate that can crash down on the Rancor (or Luke...).</li><li>Better with 9516 Jabba's Palace!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Although the Rancor is rather marvelous, it cannot swallow a whole minifigure <em>and</em> close its mouth (although the skeleton can fit when inserted properly). A minor detail, however.</li><li>As other reviewers have described, the Rancor Pit doesn't exactly support the entirety of Jabba's Palace too well. However, <span class=""reviewer vcard""><span class=""fn"">Sandman0 provides a good solution to this problem.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, I feel as if this is a good set for LEGO Star Wars fans to own, and especially any Episode VI fans... and most of all, Rancor fans!! I hope to see the LEGO Rancor again in other future sets (perhaps a Bull Rancor as it appears in The Force Unleashed, or a Nightsister's mount?).</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,3
"donsalsbury","2013-07-03T09:48:46.52Z","Robust Playset","<p>I bought this set for my 5-year-old and me to build and play (I build; my son and I play). We bought it based on the Rancor figure and the portcullis action.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is gorgeous, and holds structure well. Lots of large action photos and play suggestions. Instructions were fairly large by my limited experience. They are rather easy to follow, although a bit tricky when building the four columns of the pit.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A decent amount of varied pieces. I counted this down because of the BURPs. I will say that they were put to good use in one corner for a hinged secret compartment. In my opinion, though, they don't add to the build; though they may keep the price down.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Rancor monster - brilliantly conceived and adapted to Lego. I especially love the hinged lower jaw for eating minifigs. When a minifig is stuffed in, the mouth automatically closes. Likewise when the mouth is opened, the minifig comes right out. If something does get stuck, the jaw can be easily (but not too easily) removed for retrieval. The hands/claws fit around the minifigs for grasping, but the fingers come off a little too easily for my liking.</p><p>Luke Skywalker - Good fig, two-sided head, same as in Desert Skiff set, I believe.</p><p>Gamorrean Guard - Good-looking rendition of the movie creature.&nbsp;</p><p>Rancor Trainer - Two-sided head (angry/sad), not sure about the staff, but overall a decent 3rd minifig.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Starts with the portcullis gate. This was a fun first section to hand over to my son, who could start playing rather quickly. We actually played with this section before bedtime, and saved the rest of the build for morning. My son has a hard time working the little mechanism for the gate, for some reason, and basically tears the top off it fairly often. I don't know how it could be built better; I may have to remove the locking mechanism and let him move it up and down on its own.</p><p>The base of this model comes next. Let me say that this is the most solidly constructed playset base I've seen in a long time. It's built sandwich-style, which gives the overall structure a great foundation. It keeps it from ever being top-heavy, and allows the set to be picked up and moved without worry of falling apart. There's even a little secret trap door storage area, which is fun.</p><p>The four columns come next, and along with them, the BURPs (see above). This is the only part of the build where the instructions were a bit tricky to follow because of the four different items to keep track of. It wasn't ultimately a problem, but it might be for some people.</p><p>The top of the pit comes in bag 4, along with the final top to the gate. Some nice touches, nothing special. Again, built fairly solid, despite the delicate lines.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model / Summary</h4><p>Overall, the playset is constructed very well. I would say it is 'bomb-proof' as Lego sets go--although apparently not 5-year-old-proof! Assuming I can keep rebuilding it, we should be able to play with it for quite some time. I know my son is getting lots of play out of it!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Box:&nbsp;</strong>I never have much to say about the box, so here&#39;s the only stand-out things about it.</p>

<p>Recommended age: 8-14.</p>

<p>Set number: 75005.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The <a href=""http://cache.lego.com/bigdownloads/buildinginstructions/6039409.pdf"">instruction booklet</a> is 71 pages long and has a grey colour&nbsp;scheme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>380 Pieces for &pound;59.99 at first may seem like a rip-off, but the Rancor is&nbsp;<strong>HUGE,</strong>&nbsp;so the price is still not great, but it&#39;s alright.</p>

<p>The only notable piece that isn&#39;t from a&nbsp;minifigure is the gate, which is very useful for MOCs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>The Rancor:&nbsp;</strong>I&#39;m starting off probably the main selling point of the set,&nbsp;<strong>THE RANCOR!&nbsp;</strong>He has 19 pieces of which 10 are new molds. His arms, wrists, fingers and jaw can move.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Skywalker:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw433/Luke-Skywalker-(75005)"">Luke</a>&nbsp;has a new double sided head, one side with a smile and the other with an angry looking face. He has jedi robes that were also used in the desert skiff set. Luke is holding a bone which can jam into the Rancor&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Malakili (Rancor keeper):&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw434/Malakili-(75005)"">Malakili</a>&nbsp;has a double sided head, one side is rather depressed looking and the other side is hilarious with a little tear on his check (Should I be laughing?). He has a Grim Reaper style staff that I don&#39;t think would help any with keeping the Rancor behaved.</p>

<p><strong>Gamorrean guard:&nbsp;</strong>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw405/Gamorrean-Guard-(9516)"">Gamorrean guard</a>&nbsp;is also included in Jabba&#39;s palace. He has a head piece that covers most of his torso. He has printed legs which looks weird because the back of his legs&nbsp;don&#39;t have printing. He has no accessories.</p>

<p><strong>Skeleton:&nbsp;</strong>The box doesn&#39;t show the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/gen047/Skeleton-with-Standard-Skull-Bent-Arms"">skeleton</a>&nbsp;as a minifigure, but I count it as one. It uses the arms from the 2011 Ninjago&nbsp;skeletons.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly simple. It starts of with the gate then the ground and the four pillars. Not much to say apart from it&#39;s a good build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once you complete the set, the instructions tell you to leave the gate hinged inwards, but prefer it outwards. There&#39;s a hidden compartment where the skull is laying on the floor, lift it up and there will be a bone and a key. yet another secret area, if you open the rock on the larger pillar you will notice it&#39;s a hiding spot for one of your such as Luke. There&#39;s a door that you can open as an alternative escape I guess. And last but not least the gate can lift up, and if you press the red thing near the gate you lock it&#39;s position and then drop it down on the Rancor.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is a pit pricey, but it&#39;s worth it for anyone who&#39;s been waiting for a Rancor for ages. The fact that the pit can go under Jabba&#39;s palace so someone in the palace can fall into the pit is just the icing on the cake. I would recommend this to any LEGO star wars fan.</p>

"Brickaddict221","2014-05-09T02:48:37.547Z","Great Set! Great Rancor!","<p>This set is one of the most anticipated sets of 2013. I got it for Christmas and it is awesome!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box has the yoda avatar at the top like all other 2013 Star Wars sets. Not much to say...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of cool pieces you get in this set. You get a lot of grey plate pieces and about 5 Lego BURP&#39;s. You also get a huge gate piece and a lot of sloped bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A ton of awesome minifigs&nbsp;are in this set we will start off with the most anticipated... The Rancor: this rancor figure is a main selling point for the set, he is actually very buildable. You have to attach the lower jaw,arms,fingers,claws,and the chain that dangles off his left arm. The figure is brown just like Chewbacca. And has some great detailing to give him a movie-like appearance. He has printed eyes and yellow jagged teeth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next figure is Luke Skywalker: this version of Luke is very cool. It is very similar to the desert skiff version of Luke. The printing is the same on the torso. The only difference is his head is printed with a double face one happy and one scared. He has a black torso and black legs, the torso is printed with his Jedi robes. He also comes with a large bone.</p>

<p>The next minifig is Malikili a.k.a the Rancor Keeper. He&#39;s got a brown hood. His head is double printed with a tired expression and the other one has a tear printed on it, like in the movie when he starts to cry. His torso is flesh colored and has a belly&nbsp;printed on, and chest hair. He also looks like he has a bag printed on his torso too. His legs are sand green and have no leg printing. He comes with a staff with a point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last but not least the Gamorrean Guard. This is the same version from Jabbas Palace which I will be reviewing soon. The guard has the slip on piece like Chewbacca,watto&nbsp;and the ewok clan. It is very detailed and has a lot of different colors to make it look just like the one in the movie. He&#39;s got a plain brown torso with sand green arms underneath the detailed head piece. He&#39;s got sand green legs like Malikili&nbsp;but he has some printing on his of shredded clothing.&nbsp;He also comes with a chicken leg... Or whatever they call it in the Star Wars Galaxy.</p>

<p>The set also comes with a Lego skeleton minifig but there&#39;s not much to say about him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is both fun and challenging. It has a lot of functions to build too.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks excellent. We will start from bottom to top. The set has a square like appearance. The outer part has a thin amount of flooring but in the middle it has a place to put the rancor. You have a secret compartment with a key and bone. A skull sits on top of the secret compartment. You also have a box where you can put the Gamoreans&nbsp;chicken leg if you wish. The skeleton can lean up against the box if you want. Next you have 2 columns of rock made with BURP pieces on the left side and on the right side you have a gate. A secret hideout is made with the BURPS and hinge pieces for Luke to hide. There&#39;s a door for the keeper to come through next to the gate. And next to the gate is a place where a key,pitchfork, and bucket sit. Inside next to the gate you get 2 flaming torches. You can pull the gate up and push in the technic pins to make it hold if you wish. Then on the outside next to the gate you have a button which Luke can push to make the gate come crashing down on the Rancor. The set at the top has 4 triangle like points so you could snap in underneath your jabbas palace.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a great set for playability and display. I think the figures are great especially the rancor. You can also snap it underneath your jabbas palace to make one huge awesome scene from Return of the Jedi.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Great minifigs</p>

<p>Beautiful set</p>

<p>goes well with jabbas palace</p>

<p>great pieces</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Really pricey</p>
