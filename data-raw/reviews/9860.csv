Once all the pieces comes into place, this BARC speeder really does look amazing. &nbsp;The BARC speeder offer flick missiles on the side cart and it also allow the cart to swing backward if enemy attack from behind the bike. &nbsp;I have to say this vehicle is worth the price of admission. &nbsp;I purchased this set for $25 and I believe it is worth it just for the BARC speeder alone (with the minifigs of course). &nbsp;I would rather see Lego give us extra armor pieces to the BARC then to give us the blue droid vehicle.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, the build was a clever and a lot of fun.

"darth2701","2015-02-04T10:17:22.78Z","An awesome and bigger set of set 7620.","<p>This is the set for my 12th birthday, this year I&#39;m going 14. i was looking for the AT-RT set, but there&#39;s none. Then I saw this and the 75000 Clone Troopers VS Droideekas, and I bought those two. I was quite happy to have the minifgures.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is medium-sized.&nbsp; The instruction is standard sized and there are 2 plastic bags inside. There is a sticker sheet inside.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are no new parts, except for Rex&#39;s helmet. But it doesn&#39;t matters. There are no printed bricks, except for the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<h3>Obi-Wan Kenobi</h3>

<p>Obi-Wan is in Season 3-6 design. He looks quite like the EP3 Kenobi except for his cartoon design. He has a tan Jedi robe and black gloves. He has the same hairpiece. He has two-side face, one smiling and the other frustrated/angry? He has a blue lightsaber.</p>

<h3>Captain Rex</h3>

<p>He is in the Phase II armor. His helmet is awesome, although it has no little holes for the equipments. His pauldron and kama is fabric. His head is still the same. He has two small blaster pistols, different from the 2008-11 version. He&#39;s my favourite minifig from this set.</p>

<h3>Commando Droids</h3>

<p>There are two commando droids included in this set. They haven&#39;t changed a bit. Each of them has a standard blaster pistol.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<h3>The Commando bikes</h3>

<p>The looks like Count Dooku&#39;s speeder bike in 75017. Its blue and dark grey in colour, and has Separatist emblems. It has a 2x2 round brick as a stand. A droid can ride it by &quot;holding&quot; the bars.</p>

<h3>The BARC speeder with Sidecar</h3>

<p>The BARC speeder is like the other BARCs but bigger. Its mostly dark red and grey. It has many stickers on it. The sidecar is the interesting part of the set. It has a double-barrel gun and 2 flick-fire missiles. It is connected to the speeder with a Technic bar and other Technic stuffs. There are some Technic stuffs also to lock it in its position. The side car can swing at least 200 degrees.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model resembles the BARC speeder and sidecar very well. The commando speeder sin&#39;t really interesting, its just for adding the playability. The model is similar to 7620 Indiana Jones Motorcycle Chase, but bigger and better</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A playable set and a good resemblance. The designers has done a good job for this set. Keep building and sorry for my strange English.</p>

"Scott1","2021-06-02T00:02:21.23Z","The Infamous Phase 2 Captain Rex","<p>It should be fairly obvious what the allure of this set is. Captain Rex is one of The Clone Wars&#39; most popular characters. He has two main outfits: his Phase 1 armor, which came in many sets from 2008-2011, and his Phase 2 armor, which ONLY ever came in this set, and this set alone. Clad in his&nbsp;Phase 2 armor, he recently made an appearance in Season 7 of the Clone Wars last year, and is going to make even more appearances&nbsp;in the near future.&nbsp;If you want&nbsp;this extremely popular character in Lego form, this is the only set that you can get him in.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box and instructions, if I remember correctly, were pretty much standard for their day.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>I think most of the parts included are really only good for this set, as the large pieces on the speeder wouldn&#39;t really have a good use elsewhere. But considering the insane value of this set second-hand now, I see no reason to take it apart in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>What else is to say about the minifigs that hasn&#39;t already been said? The Captain Rex is absolutely <strong>phenomenal</strong>, even today. Which is a good thing, considering Lego has not yet made another version since this set. The commando droid and Obi-Wan are much less exciting, though still nice additions. They have been in many other sets besides this one,&nbsp;and so they can be obtained in those sets instead.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>Both of the speeders in this set look excellent, even today. The stickers add some very nice detail, especially the small Separatist insignia and the blue stripes on the back of the droid speeder. The BARC looks accurate to what we see in the show, and is very sturdy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playability</strong></h3>

<p>The playability of this set is legendary. Not so the set itself, but Captain Rex is a fan favorite, and has appeared many times since this set was released. Kids want a Captain Rex to go along with their Ashoka Tano, or their Bad Batch figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the set itself was very good when it first came out as well. The sidecar can rotate to its side and can even detach from the larger BARC, and the Separatist speeder is a nice touch for Rex and Obi-Wan to chase.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>

<p>Now, when this set was new, I would have thought that it was a little overpriced. I specifically remember thinking that I wanted&nbsp;another clone trooper or at least a regular battle droid. Looking back however, the Captain Rex was THE highlight of the set, and considering the prices he&#39;s going for now, the set was an absolute steal.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Overall</b></h3>

<p>This Captain Rex figure is quickly becoming one of the most sought after Star Wars minfigures ever, because they have not released a new set with him in it to this day. And on top of that, this wasn&#39;t even a full release set; it was a Walmart exclusive. So not only did they only release one Phase 2 Captain Rex, but the set that he DID come in wasn&#39;t even widely available. There is no doubt that Lego misjudged (and continues to misjudge) the popularity of this character.</p>

<p>Prices on eBay are reaching $150 or more, just for this one minifigure alone, and to rub salt into the wound, he&#39;s going to make another appearance in The Bad Batch show on Disney+ in the coming weeks. I have no doubt that prices will <strong>spike</strong> on top of already extremely inflated levels, especially considering they made a Bad Batch shuttle with all the members of the Bad Batch, but no&nbsp;Rex.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a kid and want to re-enact the show, or an adult trying to assemble a full collection, this set is an absolute must-have. Assuming you can afford the astronomically inflated prices, that is.&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-05-13T21:04:47.26Z","A Season Four exclusive","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I saw the BARC&nbsp;speeder with sidecar in &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, an episode of The Clone Wars: Season Two. I was immediately fascinated by it, and when I found that it had a Lego version, I decided that I had to buy it. Nevertheless I waited until now for the acquisition, although I had to spend about 50&euro;: in fact I really needed Obi-Wan and Rex, and for them, and also for the nice speeder, I paid that much. It wasn&#39;t a wrong decision.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a bit smaller than medium size sets&#39; ones. It shows the two speeders fighting on a desert-rocky planet (it seems to be Tatooine&nbsp;or Onderon, but it could represent Kiros too). On the rear we can see play features, mostly based on the sidecar. Instructions were in a single book, easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Although pieces aren&#39;t many, I found some very particular parts, for example a long grey brick in droid&nbsp;speeder&#39;s&nbsp;tail and the couple of dark grey pieces that link BARC&nbsp;speeder with sidecar. About colors, there are mainly&nbsp;grey parts, wth blue ones (droid speeder) and dark red and white ones (BARC speeder).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are excellent. I&#39;ll start from the less interesting ones: <strong>commando droids</strong>. They have already appeared in other sets, so aren&#39;t pretty unique. This minifigure of <strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong>&nbsp;is included only in this set, although the Jedi is contained in other ones; it&#39;s pretty loyal to the original character, with the look that we can see starting from&nbsp;Season Three. <strong>Captain Rex</strong> is the best figure here. It&#39;s fantastic, with fabric pauldron and &quot;kama&quot; (clone commanders&#39;&nbsp;skirt). His armor is very high&nbsp;detailed, with mud tracks and scratches.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very fast, it took about 20 minutes. There weren&#39;t very particular techniques, but however the build was funny and never repetitive. The project doesn&#39;t include complex passages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed models are nice; obviously, BARC speeder seems to me fascinating. I don&#39;t appreciate the fact that moving the sidecar the pair of grey pieces below remain protruding, but it&#39;s only a detail. For the rest, the models are both perfect. I also didn&#39;t like the presence of so many stickers to be used on a so little set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very appreciable set, with an excellent choice of minifigure, sold at a low price. Definitely a good purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; low price</p>

<p>&ndash; excellent minifigures</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; extensive use of stickers</p>

<p>&ndash; inaccurate sidecar&#39;s&nbsp;rotating mechanism&nbsp;</p>
