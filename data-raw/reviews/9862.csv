Two days without finding anything to post about is unusual. So, let&#39;s kick-start the week with short and sweet reviews of all three of the Series 3 Star Wars Planet sets.</p>
<p>
	First up, I&#39;ll take a look at <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75006-1"" title=""View set details"">75006</a> Jedi Starfighter and Kamino, which I&#39;m hoping is going to be better than the disappointment that was&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?id=5376""> B-Wing and Endor</a> from Series 4.</p>
<p>
	Kamino&nbsp;is &quot;the watery world where the Clone Army for the Galactic Republic was created, as well as the Kamino Home Fleet. It was inhabited by a race of tall, elegant beings called the Kaminoans, who kept to themselves and were known for their cloning technology. Kamino was located just south of the Rishi Maze, and was governed by the Ruling Council, headed by the Prime Minister.&nbsp;&quot;<br />

<h2>
	Box and contents</h2>
<p>
	No surprises here then, a planet with two bags inside it, and an instruction book, all in a box with a cut-out front and back for the planet to protrude through.</p>
<p>
	The actual planet is &#39;ADU Blue&#39; as first seen in the Alien Conquest sets.</p>

<h2>
	The minifig</h2>
<p>
	The &#39;minifig&#39; is an astromech droid, R4-P17, a distant relation to R2-D2 I imagine. There&#39;s nothing remarkable about him but, like all astromechs, he&#39;s quite cute. He is, however, unique to this set.</p>
<p>
	&quot;R4-P17, nicknamed R4, or Arfour, was the astromech droid attached to Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s Delta-7 Aethersprite-class starfighter and was often on board his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class starfighter and Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor prior to and during the Clone Wars.&nbsp;&quot; <em>Source <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/R4-P17"">Wookiepedia</a></em></p>

<h2>
	The Starfighter</h2>
<p>
	I&#39;m very glad&nbsp;to say that, unlike the B-Wing, the ship in this set is excellent. It uses SNOT techniques, utilising the new<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4654582"">&nbsp;&#39;Angular Plate 1,5 Top 1 x 2 1/2&#39; brackets&nbsp;</a>to good effect to create a smooth, symmetrical nose and wing profile. The printed 1 x 1 round tile is particularly nice.</p>

<h2>
	The completed model</h2>
<p>
	Like the other Planets, this comes with a base, featuring a unique <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8380195152/in/photostream/"">printed 4 x 4 tile</a>, to mount the minifig and ship onto.</p>

<h2>
	Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	This is a excellent set and there&#39;s nothing to dislike about it: the minifig is great and the ship is very well made, looks like it should, and is very &#39;swooshable&#39;.</p>
<p>
	The cost of the Planets, in the UK at least, at &pound;9.99 is perhaps a little on the high side, although if this year is anything like last year, Argos will soon have them available 3-for-2. In the USA, $9.99 is probably about right.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:33:40.423Z","Great Model, Poor Minifigure","<p><strong>Set #75006 Jedi Starfighter &amp; Kamino: </strong>It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed one of the planet sets. LEGO started these in 2012 and brought them into 2013, they were unfortunately slow to sell despite having some great mini models of Starfighters and capital ships as well as some interesting printed planet pieces. It took me a while to pick this one up, and most places sold out before I got around to it, and this review will explain why.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Planet Series boxes are pretty much designed to showcase the planets. This is unfortunate because it means these boxes are very minimal and not the best when it comes to LEGO Packaging. I believe I&rsquo;ve avoided discussing them in the past; I felt for this last set review (as Series 4 is rather hard to come by) I&rsquo;d mention everything for the set.</p>

<p>The instructions are fairly minimal as well, they show the build and each step is easy to follow and they even include the set and figure checklists that were found in other sets. However as I said in my previous review, these 2013 checklists are a bit minimal as well. They don&rsquo;t include the planet sets figures, and they don&rsquo;t show every set released in the initial wave of 2013 if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t say much for the parts in the set, nothing rare, unique or exceptionally useful. I do love the planet pieces though, and having spent so much on these sculpts I&rsquo;m hoping LEGO&rsquo;s play pattern finds a way to incorporate them well. Since the printing on them was exceptionally well.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why I was so late to getting this set, while the model included in this planet set was very impressive I was less impressed with the choice of minifigures. R4-P17.</p>

<p>Neither rare nor highly sought after this little Astromech is Obi-Wan&rsquo;s companion on his quest to unlock the secrets of the clones and Jango Fett. I would have preferred honestly if we&rsquo;d gotten a Taun-We or Kaminoan Cloner Mini-Figure, since we still haven&rsquo;t gotten those characters in the set. I guess because of the fact that Obi-Wan&rsquo;s Starfighter was included as the ship here having a Kaminoan Cloner would have looked odd.</p>

<p>Nothing against R4, I mean it is a nicely detailed and great looking Astromech. Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t as useful as the pilots that can fill in your ranks from the other sets.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build in this set is fast and relatively easy, there&rsquo;s nothing highly complex here. The stands that are used for the figures and Starfighters in these planet sets are built to showcase those two elements out of black pieces. Not bad, the Starfighter build is a nice upscaled version of the Delta-7 Light Interceptor. It&rsquo;s unfortunate LEGO didn&rsquo;t think to include pieces in the build for the Hyperdrive ring.</p>

<p>I do wish there was more of a solid connection for the front section of the ship, it tends to move around to easily.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Jedi Starfighter model is another great micro-ship build. It&rsquo;s fun and you can play with it to your heart&rsquo;s content. If you have space issues it also makes for a very nice alternative to the larger sized versions that have been made over and over again.</p>

<p>The stand is what it is, some nice printing on the ship name panel which others may use to MOC a larger stand for the bigger ship if they wanted.</p>

<p>And of course we have the planet, not built, but a great looking printed element that showcases the planet of Kamino quite nicely. And they make great storage spaces for the sets when not on display.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I have to be honest, I recommend the models from this set, it&rsquo;s something you might want to bricklink someday. Unfortunately I just do not like the R4 minifigure being included here. Astromechs are exciting when they&rsquo;re included in a larger set and can fit inside the ship, here&hellip; I think it was wasted potential that LEGO could have used to finally give us a Taun-We.</p>

<p>I got this on sale for a decent price and it fills a hole in my Planet Series collection. I&rsquo;d say save your money though and don&rsquo;t try to track this down, as Series 4 is a much better series to track down and pick up. So very mildly recommended.</p>

The Planet</p>

<p>planet sets are pretty good, but this with one the clouds distract too much. Yet again the top has an ugly hook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifig</p>

<p>The Minifigure is R4-P17. A new&nbsp;variant is welcome, but I would have preferred a kaminoan or Obi-wan or even Jango Fett.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ship</p>

<p>The ship is a delta 7 starfighter. as micro scale, it doesn&acute;t do much, but still looks nice.</p>
