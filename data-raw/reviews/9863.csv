"EtudeTheBadger","2013-01-12T13:48:38.887Z","I Think I'm A Clone Now","Another year, another set of Planet Sets. But, with the quality this good, who can complain? This time around, we've got a Clone Trooper, Coruscant and a Republic Acclamator I-class assault vessel. Good line-up!<br><br>Let's get on with this thing!<br><h4>Pros</h4><p>The Clone Trooper features Episode II styling - well, the movie is coming out in 3D in September, so that makes sense. Seeing as the year's sure to be full of AOTC-themed sets, this one sets the pace. The helmet mould is from the previous Clone Wars sets, but with new printing. He's well detailed, and features a new clone face with determined expression. Nice!</p><p>The assault ship model is where this set really shines, though. I've been waiting ages for a Republic assault ship in LEGO form, and this set has provided one! While the parts used in the ship are nothing overly enthralling, the way they're used is really effective and do a good job of portraying the ship. I do like the lightsaber hilt used for the bridge!</p><p>Coruscant is also great, and possibly the best planet released yet. Clouds and glowing city sprawl is well represented by some top notch printing, especially the metallic piping used for the city. The print is of good quality and features no glaring errors. Great!<br></p><p>The price is also good. Â£10 for all you see above is okay with me.<br></p><h4>Cons</h4><p>The Clone Trooper's face printing is missing the small grey breath filter part on mine. This did bother me a little, but at least the rest of the helmet looks good. <br></p><p>None of the parts are really that great, and the assault ship has no real underside. I realize that, if it did, it would look a little bloated, but surely something could have been put underneath to give it a little more heft.</p><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>An Acclamator assault ship at last!</li><li>Clone Trooper is cool</li><li>Coruscant is brilliant</li><li>Price is worth it<br></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>No really new or interesting parts</li><li>Some of the printing is a bit sloppy</li><li>Assault ship could have been more bulky</li></ul><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>This is a good set, and the low price is well worth shelling out the credits for. While it is a little bland in the part department, 75007 does well in the figure and model categories. This is a must-have for Republic Navy fans and also a good buy for fans of Star Wars in general!</p><p>-maaboo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4

<p>
	This one, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75007-1"" title=""View set details"">75007</a> Republic Attack Ship and Coruscant, like all Planet sets consists of a Planet, a spacecraft, a minifig&nbsp;and a display stand.</p>
<p>
	According to <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Coruscant"">Wookiepedia</a>...</p>
<p>
	Coruscant was, during most of galactic history, the most politically important world in the galaxy.&nbsp;Its hyperspace coordinates were (0,0,0) which effectively made it the centre of the galaxy.</p>
<p>
	The entire surface of Coruscant was covered by sprawling kilometers-high ecumenopolis (single worldwide city), and boasted a population of over a hundred billion to several trillion, depending on the era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Anyway, on with the review...</p>

<h2>
	Box and contents</h2>
<p>
	If you&#39;re familiar with other Planet sets you&#39;ll find no surprises here.</p>

<h2>
	The minifig</h2>
<p>
	This is a new design of Clone Trooper for 2013 which BrickLink designates <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sw442"">sw442</a>&nbsp;and claims is an episode 2 variant.&nbsp;However, it has to be said he&#39;s pretty boring. I think the main differences between it and earlier episode 2 Clone Troopers (e.g. <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=sw058"">this one</a>) are the facial expression and a&nbsp;darker torso print.</p>

<h2>
	The ship</h2>
<p>
	The Republic Attack Ship looks great until you compare it with what I believe it&#39;s supposed to resemble. The page on Wookiepedia for the <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Acclamator_I-class_assault_ship"">Acclamator I-class assault ship</a>&nbsp;shows something with much wider wings, more like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Vulcan"">Vulcan</a>.</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, it&#39;s a well-made &#39;swooshable&#39; model.</p>

	The completed model</h2>

	Not much to say about it really...</p>

<h2>
	Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	This is another good addition to the Planets series, although the minifig is a bit boring, and also appears in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75000-1"" title=""View set details"">75000</a> <em>Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas.</em>&nbsp;The ship is well made and despite not looking <em>quite </em>like the prototype is still an excellent model.</p>
<p>
	Not an essential purchase given the minifig is not unique and the ship not iconic, but one that you&#39;ll be pleased with if you do buy it.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-11-18T08:03:59.473Z","Where are you taking them?","<p><strong>Set #75007 Republic Assault Ship &amp; Coruscant:</strong> Planet Series 3 is apparently the last one made available outside of Europe (a real shame too as I desperately want Series 4, but I still maintain hope for the holiday shopping and miraculous case appearances in Canada.) and it offers up some nice looking planets with some interesting mini ship models. Not so much with rare or impressive Mini-Figures sadly, generic troop builders is all you're likely to see.</p>
<p>The Republic Assault Ship is the first item on the list, it's a great looking little model, these are the precursors to the Imperial Star Destroyers and it shows. From the all grey color scheme and the similar yet not identical build this little ship is a great addition to the miniature models that LEGO has produced over the past three years. I actually enjoyed the build here more than I thought I would, despite some of the sameness involved during construction. An impressive little ship.</p>
<p>Coruscant is a brilliant looking Planet set with a great accurate print detailing the planet that is just one never ending city. It's one of the better planets out there, I mean sure they're all basically just useless lumps of plastic that drive up the prices on these sets, however I am a firm believer that they retain some value. And LEGO did take painstaking time to ensure accurate print detailing on something that could have just been standard.</p>
<p>Phase 1 Clone Trooper, basic, found in a plethora of different sets with similar printing detail and accessories. Really a ho-hum kind of Mini-Figure when put next to the impressive model in the set, a Jedi General such as Even Piell or Shaak Tii would have uped the value of this considerably. (Though it may have caused a shortage leading to rage fueled fans.)</p>
<p>Overall I'd say the set is worth your time to get, it includes a decent looking planet that isn't imediately bin worthy, the mini model of the ship has an interesting design with simple build that is enjoyable to make and while the Mini-Figure isn't rare or immediately collectible, you can never go wrong with more Clones for your GAR. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
