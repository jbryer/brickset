Blow up the planet with the 'planet' Death Star! Get Leia to kiss a trooper and make him smile! This is a top little set! It redeems this fourth wave from the dull Hoth set and the dissatisfying B-Wing set. And tellingly it's high point isn't the figure...</p><p>The <b>minifigure</b> is pretty unremarkable really, he's the exact same Rebel Trooper we're used to from other sets and advent calendars, he's just got a smile that the standard Tantive IV troopers don't have. So nothing to shout about, but nothing to complain about either with this being only a step behind stormtroopers for army building!</p><p>The <b>planet</b> is by far the best of this wave and on a par with the Endor Forest Moon and just above Tatooine (and Naboo). I suppose though, while it's nice to have a realistic planet with land and oceans rather than the somewhat ridiculous single-climate planets, it would make the planets rather repetitive if they all looked like Earth! Certainly though the mix of green shades amongst the oceans with cloud printing looks brilliant and will enhance any display of SW sets if hung/suspended high in the background.</p><p>And this set is just right because the focus of is right where it should be: the figure and planet are balanced perfectly by the brilliant <b>vehicle</b>.<br>The Tantive IV is close to the Lambda Shuttle as my favourite SW vehicle (the Snowspeeder is my favourite <i>small</i> vehicle) and it is perfectly recreated here. The fez type pieces that make the hammerhead shark-type cockpits are combined nicely with the new round 1x1 tiles. The whole ship is very nicely made with good SNOT techniques. And the engine array is certainly a relief if you've spent ages putting the large scale version together, coming together in just a few steps!! The way it clips to the main body is especially pleasing.<br>The ship looks great on its stand and is pleasingly substantial with good detailing and micro-simulated greebles. It's a real treat of a set, it's just a shame it's not leading the line but rather redeeming the wave.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Really great micro scale Tantive IV</li><li>Good SNOT techniques and pieces used throughout the ship</li><li>Excellent planet (makes up for Hoth, Bespin and Yavin IV!)</li><li>Good figure, not amazing, but nice to have</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Nothing much, it's a great set!</li></ul>
<p>With the mediocre B-Wing and Snowspeeder this set had some apologising to do - apology accepted! Where I'd only want to take the figures from the other two it's the vehicle and the planet that I want in this one, the set's great through and through. There's playability too, but perhaps only by virtue of the role the ship and planet played in the film and how well they'd fit with other mini/midi-scale sets.<br></p><p>And value-wise this is the only set of the three that can justify the price jump, keeping a modest piece count for such a small set. In fact if it had been £9.99 I'd have been extolling it's good value amongst the normally pricey license, so £11.99 ain't so bad at all.</p><p>This is definitely one to look for, and one that might win the planets some new fans.<br>(If that's you, I'd say check out the Death Star/TIE Inteceptor next.)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3

The other day I picked up a couple of them at a local store - just for the bargain of the price. They were so cheap I could buy multiples. Perhaps I invest in them for future sale when the time is right (or sell them as Christmas Tree ornaments?!). Let's see what the replacement theme, micro fighters, has to offer.<div><br></div><div>It was too bad LEGO didn't made the most of the series, an obvious epic fail before closing the theme was to not make <b>EARTH</b>. They could have ended it by giving us the planet Earth, George Lucas with a printed ""star wars"", ""thx 1138"" or something - film clapper &amp; some out of this world drag-racing car. Apparently, Mr. Lucas had/has a thing for drag-racing cars.</div><div><br></div><div>But now we have <b>Alderaan</b>, which is somewhat as close to the planet Earth as we can get in LEGO form, visually and print-wise. I think they did a good job, the atmosphere swirls over the continents nicely and the blue colour is just spot on. It surely looks like a peaceful planet. Mind you, if there's a Death Star close by, you're in trouble! As always it comes with a stand and a little thing on the top if you would want to re-create the galaxy in your room.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The<b> rebel trooper</b>s are always nice to get. It's just something basic to have a couple of them, better to have a lot of them. Ever since LEGO gave us the battle pack in 2008 I have tried to get my hands on them whenever I get a chance. A small army of them looks cool. There's something with the LEGO rendition of them that I like, I guess. The helmet, the vest and so on. The blaster included is standard Star Wars blaster (which in fact resembles the DH-17 blaster, seen in the boarding scene in ""A New Hope"" used by the rebel troopers).</div><div><br></div><div>As with all these planets, there's a stand to be built. And a vehicle to be rested on the stand. I wasn't really excited to build a micro version of the Tantive IV, to be honest. But I quickly changed my mind during the build. The designer for this micro model was smart! As the ship came to completion I thought it really had captured the essence of the bigger model. The engine part is bulky in a good way, looks massive. Simply put, the ship is great in all its simplicity.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>The best planet of the bunch.</li><li>Rebel trooper.</li><li>The Tantive IV as a micro-ship is just fantastic!</li></ul><div>Cons:</div></div><div><ul><li>There are no cons here...</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,3
