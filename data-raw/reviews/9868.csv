<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inside the polybag&nbsp;are these LEGO parts: A large cobweb, a bat, a glow-in-the-dark spider, a trans. red diamond, a dark trans. green crystal, and a buildable skeleton with a fairly detailed face. &nbsp;A pack of stickers is also included.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While you can&#39;t make up a story or scenery with just this small bag of parts, each and every piece is a great addition to anyone&#39;s LEGO collection.</p>
