I snapped it up imediatly as it was a good deal.</p><p>But at full price, is it worth it?</p><h4>Packaing</h4><p>The packaging was easy to get into and can be reused, UNlike the ninjago ones. Not much else to say here...</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>If trans light blue's your thing, this set is great. 12 chi crystals, a 4x4 inverted radar dish , a diamond, a 1x1 can piece and a clear trans blue orb piece. There is a gold telescope piece and a gold sensei wu hat included. Some green foliage as well as some other common parts, but the most intresting aprts are the speedors</p><p><strong>Speedorz</strong></p><p>Each speedor runs on a wheel piece powered by ripcord and 2 technic pins connect a shell onto the wheel, after putting your fig in. A spike piece and a sawblade tail are also added to make the extras, to make it a bit more unique. These things move FAST. Probably could kill a human with the right training...</p><h4>Figs</h4><p>Longtooth:He is the dark tan (or sand yellow) lion, who has a scar disfiguring his face. He probably has a 6 pack (the bottom 2 ""packs"" cant be seen) and has stylised lion kneepads. and a belt. No armor.</p><p>Wakz:Nice wolf helmet mould, Thats not to unique and could be used as a halloween dress or soemthing. His face looks dodgy, he must be quite old. Red tshirt with fang necklace, silver embroidments and a 4 point chi harnessing area.Torn legs with toes on feet, and no armor.</p><h4>Set</h4><p>This sets not much to talk about, but the 3 games are:</p><p>1:Lay out the 4 cones. Person withn the most cones wins.</p><p>2:Spin the chi diamond spinner. First person to hit it wins</p><p>3:Use ramp to knock over grassy pole. Person who gets chi orb wins.</p><h4>Cards</h4><p>10 cards, i dont really understand. A character card, a speedor card, 2 weapons cards and a speedor add on card. I think they work like top trumps.</p><h4>Overall</h4><p>Its a good set, fun to play with but no build. Speedors are wonderful however. Make this your first speedorz set (Unless by the time you read this, sky joust is out, That set looks better, and it comes with eris and rawzom, 2 cool figs)</p><p>Bye, and hope to see another chima review soon...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
