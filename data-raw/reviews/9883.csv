"BRICKBOY74","2013-04-17T07:59:22.687Z","Looks Cool, Kinda","<p>&nbsp;Well this is an okay set. I paid $17 so not to bad for that money.</p>
<p><strong>Box</strong></p>
<p>The box shows an okay view of the set. I would have preferd a side veiw image a little better.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>The instructions are clear with no mistakes or color changes.</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>The build takes about 25 minutes. I liked it becuase it is harder than your average city set I collect. (Althought this set wants me to come crawling back to collecting city).</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>Well I like Jay's elememntal blade. It is a n the front of the bike are also nice. Overall my favorite part would be the big samuria sword. The spare parts are great. You get two extra swords (one gold one black). How often do they do that?!</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>I really like Jay. I like the Stone Warrior even more. When Building look carfully at how to put the Warrior's shoulder arrmour on. It looks better when not put on backwards.</p>
<p><strong>Jet Pack</strong></p>
<p>Well I think this is okay. It is really flimsy. The wings seem to have a point were they just fall down and droop. That is not a problem as the jet pack wasn't the reason I bought the set.</p>
<p><strong>The Bike</strong></p>
<p>The bike is the part I don't like. Well you have to push down to get the tread to move. That means you need to bend the technic arm. The back seems to be forgotten and could use somthing to hold all of theese swords. The Stone Warrior seesm to fall off the bike alot. It is hard to roll around becuase you cant push were the red spike points forard. It will fall off.</p>
<p><strong>The tread</strong></p>
<p>This is what&nbsp;I realy don't like about this set. The tread cogs do not mtach up with the wheel cogs. he tread also streches easily and I had to get a replacemant. The tread seems to ben the axle pointing the wheels somwaht sideways. This makes the tread come off on the slightest turn. I am thinking of taking off the cogs on the wheels so that it does not make the tread bunch up in the front. When you run it on the ground it sounds like the tread it slapping when it is released from the buch up in the front tire.</p>
<p><strong>The flick Missles</strong></p>
<p>Well I really shouldn't be calling them flick misssles. When you pull a trigger on the left missles shout out on the right. If built to the instructions it it terrible. It seems to luanch them just down the side of the bike.</p>
<p><strong>The fix</strong></p>
<p>Skip from putting <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4143005"">http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4143005</a>&nbsp;in on step two and 6. Now it will shoot much farther withought the limit of theese two parts. This may strech your rubber band more than intened although I have not seen this.</p>
<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>
<p>If you want it for parts yeah buy it. Althought most parts are fairly common. I would wait till it is on sale if you still want it at all after this review.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,1,3
"Odeinoichus","2016-07-04T21:05:52.043Z","Average Build, Impressive Overall Look.","<p><strong>Set #70501 Warrior Bike: </strong>Ninjago; an interesting Theme that captured my attention right away as a fan of ninjas. Unfortunately except for a few spinners and booster packs I wasn&rsquo;t able to actively collect it as often as I wanted. I&rsquo;ve managed to acquire almost the entire 2013 wave now and I&rsquo;m pleased that I got these sets. Let&rsquo;s discuss the good points and the not so good points during what was (at the time) known as The Final Battle.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>With 2013 we were introduced to yet another new box design, every year and sub-theme from this line has featured a different design for their boxes. Making you know what you&rsquo;re getting into right out of the gate, after the red of the Skulkin days and the scaled serpentine boxes of the snake battles sub-theme comes this slightly duller toned box.</p>

<p>The colours are more subdued so you can be drawn to the eye catching blindness that is the Gold Ninja, who is predominant in the left hand corner of the box. A clever design choice, making the box really showcase the new Gold Ninja and also the fact that (again at the time) this was toted as The Final Battle. The end of Ninjago. Really solid design.</p>

<p>The manual for this set looks fine, it shows the build steps for the main build very well and doesn&rsquo;t make it too complicated. The only thing in the back aside from the piece list is a cross-promotional image of all the 2013 sets. No minifigure checklists in this one. Also of note, no numbered bags. So separate those pieces before you start building.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see much in the way of parts for this set, honestly I think the biggest draw will be the red tread and the massive rear tires. Maybe the stone grey half dome parts and the long red blades. Also there are some lime green pieces which aren&rsquo;t seen too often. Considering the build of this set I&rsquo;m not surprised at the difficulty of noting decent parts in here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>2 Minifigures in this set, both sort of unique to the set.</p>

<p>Stone Warrior: The enemies for 2013&rsquo;s Final Battle was the Stone Army, commanded by four armed Lord Garmadon, this army featured archers, a general and warriors. I am a huge fan of the Minifigures in this Theme, next to Chima these are some of the interesting and coolest looking minifigures that LEGO has made available in some time. And they always include some interesting accessories.</p>

<p>Compared to the Serpentine the Stone Warrior here might seem like a step back from the enemies of Ninjago, however the printing on him and his accessories make him pretty interesting honestly. He has a double-sided torso, leg printing and a single sided facial print on a black minifigure head (similar to Darth Maul). I&rsquo;m not sure what it is about it, but printing facial expressions on the black heads always stand out to me as being impressive.</p>

<p>For his accessories and head gear you get some pretty fun stuff, there&rsquo;s a new shoulder armour piece in red that bulks up the shoulders. He comes with two swords, a regular black Katana and a massive dangerous looking scimitar (I can&rsquo;t remember if these were newly introduced here, in Indiana Jones or the Orient Expedition era of Adventurers). Lastly the helmet he&rsquo;s wearing is made out of three pieces, the black helmet piece is from the old Ninja Sub-Theme of the Castle Era while the red decoration and the black face guard are brand new parts introduced here. (First seen with Samurai X I believe.) All in all a great looking minifigure.</p>

<p>Jay: The Ninja of Lightning is found in his black robes here (the elemental robes if I&rsquo;m not mistake) with a double-sided torso and leg printing and his usual blue face mask. Overall a great looking version of Jay, he includes his special elemental weapon and a brick-built jetpack of some sort.</p>

<p>There are no wings on this jetpack, but there are some spare golden katana and it&rsquo;s a fun little microbuild in this set, a theme of the Ninjago sets is that often you&rsquo;ll find some clever little builds like this and I have to say it&rsquo;s a welcome addition to your typical minifigure accessories. Also I really like the elemental sword piece, that&rsquo;s definitely going to see a lot of uses in the future I think.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build in this set is a step by step construction of the titular vehicle. There are a lot of Technic pieces being used to build the model and the build is done at an angle, making the completed model take some getting used to, at first I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of it during the build itself because it&rsquo;s such an awkward looking build. Once you near the finished product though you start to see the clever aspects of the design, some of the build might be a bit tricky for the younger crowd, of particular note is getting the tread onto the tires used to roll it. Be careful during that step you haven&rsquo;t put the technic pins and tires in the wrong spot, because the tread will not fit and you&rsquo;ll be trying to force it on when it isn&rsquo;t long enough to reach both tires, make sure you&rsquo;ve placed the tires and pins in the correct spots otherwise you&rsquo;ll need to do some disassembling to fix everything so it fits properly.</p>

<p>Also the rubber band gimmick is a bit of a hassle, but we&rsquo;ll get to that in the next section.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Warrior Bike might look like an ugly, shelf space taking menace, but it&rsquo;s still a fairly decent design choice. Basically it&rsquo;s a giant samurai helmet with wheels racing after the ninja, which makes it something unique and fun. For kids, for us AFOLs there are a few things that might grate on you.</p>

<p>First of all the gimmick is a mess, the tires and tread roll nicely, but the missile firing thing can get in the way and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to work right. The rubber band is used to fix up a pull back missile hitting device to launch the three flick-fire missiles and as each missile is launched the next one falls into place. Sadly this gimmick doesn&rsquo;t want to work very well, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because of the strength of the rubber band or something wrong with the build, but the missile hitting piece doesn&rsquo;t have enough pressure to actually launch the missile. So it stays partially in the launching device and it won&rsquo;t fall down for the next one to be hit, you&rsquo;d be better off just using your finger to launch the missiles at the ninja.</p>

<p>Secondly, the driver&rsquo;s area is just a place where the stone warrior is standing with a joystick to control the bike, there&rsquo;s no steering wheel, there&rsquo;s no place to sit, the minifigure just stands there to drive. Perhaps it&rsquo;s partially powered by some kind of magic, but it does leave much to be desired.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Technic nature of the build, many AFOLs may have issues with this type of build, as a fan of the Chima line these types of builds aren&rsquo;t too terrible in my eyes, however I can see where some traditionilists might take offense at this model.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall the younger fans of Ninjago will love this model, it&rsquo;s a big dangerous looking tri-wheeled bike of destruction ready to run down the ninja and lay waste to Ninjago City. AFOLs may find better uses for the parts in MOCs, unless they&rsquo;re really big fans of the Ninjago vehicle designs, because this isn&rsquo;t too terrible.</p>

<p>The included Minifigures are a real treat as well, I especially like the Stone Warrior and Jay isn&rsquo;t bad either. That being said, can I recommend this? Yep, I strongly recommend this set to the fans of Ninjago and mildly recommend this to MOC fans and minifigure fans who enjoy collecting sets of this type.</p>
