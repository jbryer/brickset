<p>If you have the &quot;Power Miners&quot; &quot;Thunder Driller&quot; (like I do) it is quite similar in looks. &nbsp;And function down to the spinning drill connected to the front wheels, through gears and rods. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It does comes with two figures, Cole and a &quot;Rock Demon&quot;. &nbsp;The new parts are a &quot;Element Blade&quot; &nbsp;witch you could stick in a light-saber&nbsp;hilt, and the &quot;Rock Demon&#39;s&quot; mantle. &nbsp;It also comes with a spare sword and a gear (along with the regular spare parts you would get). &nbsp;</p>

A pretty decent looking set and we&rsquo;ll discuss why in a minute, just one thing of note, if you hate stickers this is going to really bum you out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone into great detail over my thoughts on the box design previously, here there isn&rsquo;t much to add. The image shows Cole mercilessly prepared to crush the Stone Warrior who&rsquo;s stolen his elemental blade. And the back shows that included in this set are #3 of the elemental blades and that action feature of roll wheels, turn drill.</p>

<p>The manual is the same as the Warrior Bike, no real cross-promotional images and since there are no numbered bags it is another set you might want to sort out before building. The big thing is they seem to like announcing which Ninja is included as if it&rsquo;s a big deal or a surprise or something.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set includes huge tires and a few other useful parts, the gold drill tip and some of the brown sculpted pieces may be the most interesting for parts hunters. Not much else to say here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Only 2 minifigures in a 30$ set, again&hellip; Why do Star Wars sets at this price point get to include 3 minifigures while Ninjago limits you to only 2? More Stone Warriors would be nice to see since if you want to army build them you&rsquo;re stuck using secondary sellers or spending a lot of cash on expensive sets doubles to troop build.</p>

<p>Stone Swordsman: Speaking of which this minifigure has the same print and accessories found elsewhere in the theme, except his colours are different. He has a blue face, while the Warrior in the Warrior Bike had red face printing. It&rsquo;s nice to see the variety here. Also of note, the large scimitar weapon is not included here, instead he only has a lone black katana to defend against Cole&rsquo;s Earth Driller, or Elemental Blade (once he&rsquo;s liberated it from the thief).</p>

<p>Cole: The ninja of Earth is wearing his robes here, he doesn&rsquo;t have any accessories of his own except the elemental blade, and as the box shows he has to get it back from the warrior first. Relying on his vehicle to do his fighting for him seems to indicate this ninja has a problem with overkill. (Then again this is the Theme where Ninja have the power to unleash dragons, energy vehicles, massive weapons of energy and tornados on their enemies. Maybe we should be rooting for the bad guys here?)</p>

<p>Either way a decent pair of minifigures here, I prefer the Stone Swordsman over Cole honestly because by this point you&rsquo;ve probably got tons of ninja minifigs. And most of them aren&rsquo;t unique outside of the printing.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This is a much more impressive build than the previously reviewed Warrior Bike, there are a lot less Technic pieces used in the build, so you&rsquo;re actually using more bricks to construct the vehicle. Some aspects which are funner, the gimmick works loads better here and the spinning drill rolls in tandem with the wheels because of it.</p>

<p>There are unfortunately a lot of stickers used here for details instead of printed elements, it&rsquo;s my one complaint in the build. Even the control panel is a sticker, I&rsquo;m really starting to miss printed elements when it comes to vehicles&hellip; Part of me can understand the use of stickers, but when you&rsquo;re taking a really large sticker and placing it on the cockpit instead of using printed elements it kind of gets annoying.</p>

<p>Also unlike the Warrior Bike there are no tricky parts to this build, the younger builders will find it fast and easy to put together&hellip; they may need help placing the stickers though.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This vehicle is super fun looking, it&rsquo;s a big beefy drilling vehicle reminiscent of the old Power Miners Theme from back in the day. It&rsquo;s a nice contrast to the oddly design Warrior Bike, this vehicle at the same price point keeps all the visual aesthetic of the Ninja&rsquo;s vehicles and adds a nifty play feature. Mind you there are no projectiles, nothing to launch, flick or press to fire so that might not thrill too many younger builders since aside from the building and rolling around aspects there isn&rsquo;t much to do with it.</p>

<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the stickers though I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s almost perfect as a representative of the vehicles found in this Theme.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Highly recommended folks. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with most of The Final Battle Sub-Theme of Ninjago, 2013 was where they brought out all the stops in anticipation of the end of the Theme. Many didn&rsquo;t want to see it go, and after getting these sets I can see why. Ninjago is a really great Theme, in a way it&rsquo;s become the Castle of this new generation, with fantastical vehicles and mighty dragons, dangerous enemies and such Ninjago is to Castle what City became for Town. I have to admit though I&rsquo;m a little leery of future offerings, some of the upcoming sets seem to be stretching this Theme a bit thin&hellip; Still I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about this set, it&rsquo;s a solid looking model.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Cole&#39;s Earth Driller is an amazing set with lot&#39;s of fun details and good play features. It has some awesome killer motors in the front and in the back there are some HUGE tires to give it better traction. The big drill on front spins as you push the vehicle around and it looks fantastic. It&#39;s a great play feature and it helps Cole battle the stone warrior to retrieve his elemental blade back. The minifigures look great!</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I only have a few bad things to say about this set. The Cole minifigure in this set is awesome however I&#39;m a bit disappointed that he doesn&#39;t have is silver shoulder armor. None of the final battle wave sets have this and it&#39;s a bit disappointing. From the rear view of the set there is a big gap between the back wheels leaving a big space in the back where they could have made space to fit another minifigure&nbsp;in the driller.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I have to say about this amazing set! I hope this review was helpful and that you enjoy playing with it!</p>

<p>NINJAAAAGOOOOOOOO!!!!!!</p>
