<p>As an early Christmas gift my son got this set. He was very happy &amp; surprised to see the new waves in store already. <br/></p>
<p>Albeit the set being labeled 8+, the only part I needed to help him was with the technic based inner design (for sturdiness, and shooter). He's is 5. So he did well and the set shouldn't be to hard as well for the 6+ range Ninjago is marketed at.</p>
<p>The build is interesting and the set has a couple of stickers, those do enhance the overall look.</p>
<p>And it has the biggest and farthest shooter of all things Ninjago. Dangerous stuff.<br/></p>
<p>The two stone warriors have some real good designs and artwork. General Kozu rivalling Four armed Garmadon im..ehm... number of weapons holding. :)</p>
<p>The kimono design for Zane is well done, his new elemental weapon is flashy as it should be.<br/></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build &amp; Design of the tank<br/>
<li>Zane, Kozu and the stone warrior<br/>
<li>It is cool :)<br/></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Albeit a good shooter, real care is needed when aiming<br/><br/></li></ul>
<p>So, all in all, a very good design and good buy to what for me is the most intelligent Ninjago item in the ' final battle'&nbsp; wave.</p>
<p><br/>Edit: oh, Zane's small snow/ice walker is a funky addition. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The only thins i dont like are That theres no use of 2 manuals and they could've added a Overlord Figure. The stickers make it look so much cooler but theyre really hard to get on. Got it on Friday at upper canada mall in newmarket as a gift for christmas. At 59.99, Really good Play features. My favourite is the shooting function. The two functions are if you push a green button, the canon will shoot a evil posseser out. I really love the jail feature by creative thinking. Overall, Great Set i give this set a good mark.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,4,5,4,5

<p>Out of&nbsp;30 marks 30 highest 2 lowest.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>First we have the vehicle.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>THE VEHICLE<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>First we have the big part: this vehicle is a brilliant value for money. We have a huge vehicle and extras for only £30. Then we have a prison cell to put a figure of your choice usually Zane, we also have a gun concealed in the front of the vehicle. The most annoying part of the set is during the build the rubbery tracks are hard to put on and you have to be a really good Lego builder to put them together. It has a nice little control platform at the top where you can put figures. I&nbsp;give this a stunning 10.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>MINIFIGURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look close you can see garmatron.&nbsp;<IMG style=""PADDING-BOTTOM: 8px; WIDTH: 480px; PADDING-RIGHT: 8px; HEIGHT: 206px; PADDING-TOP: 8px"" id=il_fi src=""http://cdn.thebrickblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Ninjago-Episode-24-Image.jpg"" width=480 height=279><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>First we have the star figure - General Kozu, he&nbsp;is a 4 armed general of the Stone army, he is exclusive to Garmatron which means he is rare and a really cool figure anyway. Second we have Zane, he is dressed in the same kamino robes as the other ninjas of this wave: white suit with cool black robes - a good figure overall. Last but not least, we have the Stone army warrior: I think he is nicer than the scout and a very detailed figure, I give the figures a total score of 10.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Last we have Zane’s mech<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>ZANES MECH<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>This is a surprising part as this is tiny compared to the rest of the set. It is basically a mini ice robot for Zane, it's probably because he got the ultra-sonic raider. My score is 7 and a half.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>OVERALL!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Overall this set got 27 and half out of 30, only 2 and a half away from full marks. A good vehicle and cool figures, a good set for a good price.<o:p></o:p></p>

"X2Eliah","2014-01-14T13:28:02.887Z","Interesting, but also flawed","<p>So, Garmatron set. An off-beat quad-track tank, a.. hopper/spider thingie, and three microfigures. Is it any good? (Yes. Didn&#39;t you just see the title of this review?)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very colourful, plastered on nearly all sides with photos (or more likely, cgi renders) of the set and its playability opportunities. The box has 8 corners, and can be used afterwards for boxing. Material seems to be cardboard. Probably not edible, though, and the calories within the cardboard pulp are far and few between as well.</p>

<p>Instructions are quite informative. They will instruct the reader as to how to put the brick thingies&nbsp;together to make the bigger thingies on the box (did I mention the box has pictures of things on it?)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Alright, let&#39;s cut the rubbish and start the review proper.</p>

<p>This set has a somewhat high price-per-piece tag. However, it&#39;s also (by now, at least) probably being phased out and thus often will be discounted; wait for one of those if you end up wanting this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set mostly seems to have technic structural elements, and system detail elements (with a few big&#39;uns that you can see instantly from the pictures - curvy slanted ones for the most part). Also there&#39;s *four* tracks and ten wheels. Which is actually really good, especially at this small a set. On the downside, the tracks are a rather garish venomous red, so might be tricky to include in future builds. What you won&#39;t get from this set is material for &#39;flat&#39; models - there&#39;s little plating, most of the parts here are suited for building upwards, not outwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts you&#39;ll use for Garmatron are pretty normal and neat, gray/dark gray/black with red accents - nearly all of it useful for many, many MOCs. The spiderthingy has a lot of large gold-tone parts, however. They... might be less useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Well, the detailing on them certainly is done to a good standard. The ninjaperson looks neat, and has one face. The evil ninjaperson&nbsp;has a slightly richer detailing, with more tones and a more angular pattern. The red hat is a misstep, though - it often snaps off, and there&#39;s no stud on top, so you can&#39;t really use it for anything else but a hat.</p>

<p>The general is an odd one - essentially there&#39;s a normal torso part, atop which is another, fatter torsopart. This looks cool, but with two torsos stacked together, the problem is that arms get in the way of each other. It&#39;s difficult to pose this figure, esp. with the big arabic swords, because the topmost pair of arms will constantly get in the way of the lower arms and the weapons themselves.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Alright, this is where the Garmatron has some issues. It&#39;s a very sturdy, solid frame, and there&#39;s no rattling bits or wonky bits, and nothing&#39;s falling off. The red eyebrow-looking thingies are prone to getting in the way of hands, though, and may very easily fall out of their tiny sockets.</p>

<p>The spider doesn&#39;t articulate well (hind legs are completely fixed in place, even), and the garmatron&#39;s treads don&#39;t seem to be tensioned properly with the build&#39;s distances - they are sort of loose, and tend to stay rigid and &#39;slide&#39; rather than spin. The front-mask of the Garm was really interesting to assemble, simply in terms of the strategies used to shape it. However, it&#39;s attached by just two snap-on parts, and might come off very easily.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There&#39;s an issue with how the tracks are laid out. The whole tank is at a slight angle, so you only really get four wheels touching the ground, the other six are raised too high. This sort of defeats the purpose of threads, and it&#39;s a style that Lego&#39;s designers seem to&nbsp;favour&nbsp;a lot.&nbsp;Blech. Another issue, you&#39;d think this thing has decent ground clearance, right? Wrong. There&#39;s a crossbar right under the front wheels, and it sits at an angle such that the clearance between its lowest edge and the floor/base is.. Well, about as high as flat&nbsp;lego&nbsp;stud. No more. This makes the tank far less enjoyable to play with, I&#39;d imagine, as it can&#39;t quite negotiate anything that&#39;s not an &quot;ideal surface&quot; (flat, non-glossy floor).</p>

<p>The companion build - the&nbsp;ninjaspider&nbsp;- is really disappointing. The only thing it&#39;s good for is for parts, the build itself doesn&#39;t look particularly exciting, has little to no articulation, and doesn&#39;t even have any particularly valuable parts.</p>

<p>That said, the model does look amazing as a whole, with a well-planned colour palette and off-beat, upright-focused style. It also looks bigger than some sets with twice the part-count.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Ehhh. It&#39;s a decent set, and will look nice on a shelf. What you see in the pictures really is what you get - not many surprises build-wise, not many cutbacks. This *might* be better bought for parts than for itself, though - four treads with 10 wheels, a smattering of neutral-colour&nbsp;system and technic parts, and very few etches (most of the patterns are stickers)? Yeah, sounds like a parts-kit. The Garmatron may not be all that good garmin&#39; across rough terrain, but it has all the tools you need to make a Garmy V2.0 that can do all that and more.</p>

<p>Seriously though, 4 treads. This set is, like, four of those one-threaded-bike sets in one place!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zane:</strong></p>

<p>The elemental ice ninja! Who would think that he would be put against Kozu and the Garmatron! In this set, he is in his elemental ice suit, with his ice elemental blade. Also, he has his cool ice spider! It has saws and everything!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>General Kozu:</strong></p>

<p>That four-armed menace! It&#39;s like he is Garmadon&#39;s brother! But no. He is a stone freak, who drives the Garmatron! Pretty good job, I must say. His weapon are in the picture, which are two big blades.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stone Army Warrior:</strong></p>

<p>Typical warriors! Always trying to help, when they really make Kozu&#39;s life a living nightmare! He comes with a&nbsp;simple blade, in this set.</p>
