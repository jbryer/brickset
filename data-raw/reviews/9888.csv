"Kalhiki","2013-01-02T15:19:14.183Z","Is it a Bird? Is it a Plane?","<p>Maybe that title's better for a Superheroes set. Regardless, when pictures of the sets first came around, I immediately fell in love with this set. I felt it was one of the best looking out of them all. Plus, its&nbsp;low price point allowed me to pick it up on sight. But did it live up to my expectations and should it live up to your's?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is of an average size for this price point. As usual it features a&nbsp;picture of the set, piece count, set number, and the like. The top banner also features a nice picture of Razcal's headshot (well, eyeshot, I guess as it's not the whole head) with wispy Chi energy flowing about. The back shows off the set's functions as is customary. </p>
<p>When I opened the box I was shocked to see two manuals. I have no idea why this was necessary especially in a set this small. But whatever. Aside from regular building steps, there are also adverts for the theme showing some of the other sets and such.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Parts are actually pretty good. The wing pieces are very cool, and while they don't look very organic due to the lack of detail, they still easily pass as feathered wings (but this is a machine, so that doesn't matter). Aside from this, you also have a Chi crystal which is just another crystal mold to add to other crystals (I would like to see it recolored for other themes) and the Glider's beak. I don't know if this is new, but it's a cool piece, but it's also rubbery. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Razcal is the only minifig in this set, but he's a cool minifig either way. Lots of printed detail on the body, legs, and head. The head is double sided with an angry, sinister-eyed face and the other,&nbsp;a shocked, wide-eyed, ""I'm about to crash into a cliffside"" face. Other than this, he's equipped with armor which is necessary in order to hold a chi orb (a flat topped, clear blue stud) and the wings. Unlike the Glider's wings, these are fully feathered and very cool. Not to mention they're on little hinges to allow you to pose them.</p>
<p>In addition to this, he does have a weapon which is some massive, dual pronged blade thing. It's actually quite cool, but there's one problem which I'll cover in the completed model...</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was... Okay. Overall, it was fine and nothing less than what you'd expect. However, due to the dual instructions and the adverts, I couldn't help but feel constantly interrupted. In larger sets, this doesn't affect me as much since it allows for a break after a while of building. But in a set that doesn't take very long to construct, it's unnecessary. But this is a minor issue, and maybe I'm overreacting a bit.</p>
<p>However, there's one good thing: it has no stickers. I got this during Christmas where I was building set after set that had stickers. So getting this and not finding stickers was a welcome and somewhat surprising find.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model is fantastic. It truely invokes the appearance of a bird. I was a bit scared&nbsp;that the wings would pop off at the hinges, but luckily, due to how it's constructed, the end of the bar where it's attached is blocked off preventing them from sliding off.&nbsp;The set also includes some functions as well, one of them being the moveable toes. This, while simple, allows&nbsp;it to stand and ""perch"" on some objects. For instance, it's sitting on my laptop moniter right now. But there's one function I don't quite understand. Theres a chain thing that can&nbsp;shoot out of it's rear. The box shows it carrying the Chi crystal, so I guess this is probably it's purpose. I always imagine the Ravens as thieving and&nbsp;scavenging, so it would make sense to have a way for it to carry extra crystals. But aside from these functions, the set doesn't offer much else, so playability suffers without another set.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, there is one problem I have with the minifig weapon, that being it uses parts from the actual model. This is mainly the two purple pieces on&nbsp;each side of the&nbsp;tail as the main body of the weapon is stored on the side of the Glider. I don't like this as&nbsp;you always&nbsp;need to take some parts from the actual model in order to have his weapon. This means you can't display the completed model and Razcal with his sword... thing.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overal, this set is wonderful. The complaints with the weapon is really the only main&nbsp;issue as I can excuse the problems I find with the instructions.What you have in the end is a great looking model and a great looking minifig.&nbsp;Overall, it's well worth your money, a great set to get if you're on the fence about the theme as a whole, and deserving of a rating of 5/5.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-01-19T12:28:42.087Z","The Legends Begin","<p>Set #70000 Razcal's Glider: My goal with the Legends of Chima line was to stick with collecting only the Speedorz for the Mini-Figures, then I saw the price in Canada for Speedorz and realized I'd need to budget carefully just to get them. However I started taking a closer look at the sets, and while I had no intention of getting them all some of them are really worth picking up for us AFOLs.</p>
<p>Aesthetically speaking the design of the Chima vehicles are either hit or miss, with all of the empty space and use of technic pieces the land-based tribes vehicles just look too kid oriented for my tastes, they don't stand out as being worth the asking price, so I'll stick with collecting those tribes through the Speedorz sets. However I have really taken a shine to these bird tribe vehicles, they offer up the same solid looking builds the Ninjago Serpentine themed sets did. There is no empty space, or wasted potential, the vehicles of both the Raven and Eagel tribes stand out as some of the best Legends of Chima have to offer.</p>
<p>Case in point, this is Razcal's Glider, a personal vehicle that (in the show) can serve as a squad of little aerial assault craft (if you wanted to buy more than one) and is the cheapest set on offer that is not Speedorz related. (Or polybagged, which hasn't hit many retailers yet.) The pieces used are all black, dark red/maroon, dark stone gray or dark purple. There are also two blue pieces used as part of the foot/claw build, some don't like the fact that they are blue and think it breaks up the look of the vehicle, while black might have been a better choice I happen to like the splash of blue color used here as it draws the eye and breaks up the look of the model the right way. And not obtrusively like some color choices might.</p>
<p>The glider resembles a raven, with a beak, two transparent red studs for eyes and the wing and tail feathers. It is a bird turned LEGO vehicle for the tribe of Ravens to use, not just Razcal. I find it a little odd though that the control mechanisim for this glider to be flown is a Bone piece, it doesn't look out of place in the design, but it does look unique and that isn't always to someone's taste. Another strange thing is that this is the first, in fact the only LEGO set priced at 14.99$ that I have ever bought which uses two numbered instruction books. (And it isn't like there are numbered bags, no this is a single bagged set from what I can recall that uses two numbered instruction books. And it didn't need to be... Unless... Now here's a wild theory, however most small LEGO sets use only one instruction book and it's hit or miss if you get it without it being all crumpled and creased and squashed inside the box upon first opening it. Perhaps LEGO included two instruction books for this set as a sort of test, to see if by including two instructions instead of one there are less chances of them being squashed and mangled in the box when placed inside of it.)</p>
<p>The big features of this glider are, moveable wing mounts (they can be set to glide mode or take-off mode.) Adjustable tail, and press-to-fire launcher for stealing the Chi crystal from other Tribes. Attached by a LEGO chain to the glider the missile doesn't fly far, or get lost, it is a play feature that looks a bit strange and takes a little getting used to. Also the talons can be posed, although it is tricky to get them to hold an actual Mini-Figure and I still haven't found the best way for them to do so. Last, but not least there are two printed tiles with what I'm assuming to be the symbol of the Raven tribe.</p>
<p>Now let us discuss Razcal, the Mini-Figure; the Legends of Chima line has some of the most impressively detailed and printed Mini-Figures I have ever seen in a LEGO Theme. I mean each and every one I've seen pictures of so far has double-sided torsos, double-printed heads and leg printing on the front that includes printing on the toes. Razcal is no exception, his torso shows a lot of detail, from the numerous belts and pouches for holding 'Trinkets and Treasures' to the purple feathers and the blue Chi chest holder. His back also has two pouches on the belt and a lot of feather detailing. He's wearing a belt that joins onto the leg printing with another strap to hold another pouch, two knee-pads with Raven Tribe marking and of course his talons on his toes.</p>
<p>Introduced for this Theme is a new shoulder accessory, the Chi harness that actually holds the small flat-clear blue studs representing Chi. And on the back are two studs to hold the wings, great new pieces these wings are full of sculpted detail work and cast in black plastic for the Raven Tribe or white for the Eagles. Two c-clips hold them in place and they can be positioned any way you want. The head itself has two printed faces, one side is Razcal's regular face with two yellow eyes surrounded by red detailing and a beak for the mouth print. (It's nice to see them have mouths underneath the head pieces they come with, in case for whatever reason you lost the head piece he still looks complete.) The other side of the head is printed with a wide-opened eyed expression, that I feel confident in saying represents the Mini-Figure when he's powered up by Chi, as seen on the show. Powered by Chi Razcal is ready to tap into his super powers... Whatever those are.</p>
<p>Lastly there is the head piece itself, a great new sculpted piece to represent all Raven Tribe members, each head piece looks identical when first cast out of the ABS plastic, it is only through the printed detailing that they are differentiated. Razcal's headpiece has printing near the top of the eyes, what could be gold rings pierced there, perhaps as the show has indicated that Ravens love Trinkets and Treasures. The beak is painted a dull gray with gold on top to show the metal plate Razcal has riveted onto his beak. (Seriously there are four small circles that look like Razcal did indeed painfully rivet this gold plated armor on top of his beak.)</p>
<p>Razcal's accessories include a Chi crystal and a weapon, from what I've gleaned the Legends of Chima sets include weapons that can be built out of existing pieces on the models themselves, or at least I think that's the gimmick. Case in point Razcal's weapon, a battle droid torso in black with other pieces attached to it that takes the two smaller tail feathers off the glider and turns them into a sort of double-bladed claw weapon, or perhaps Chi Crystal grabber. It is the one drawback to the set, in that the weapon uses those tail feather pieces from the main model.</p>
<p>Overall this is an excellently designed set with only a minor flaw, the use of two pieces from the main model for the weapon. It's small, fast to build, and great fun to play with for the kids, as far as AFOLs are concerned I personally think this is one of the more solid looking vehicle designs out of the Chima Theme, none of the Wolf or Lion Tribe vehicles look good enough to me to pick up and the only Croc Tribe vehicle that has interested me is that big command ship. A great set that I highly recommend picking up, there is just so much about it that is fun, I'm thinking of grabbing a second one to pit them both against Eris' Eagle Interceptor, once I have the interceptor. One thing of note, those two small tail feathers I mentioned, the pictures show them facing one way, but the instructions show them going the other way. I firmly believe that the instructions have it the right way, as they look more like tail feathers that way and less like the weapon blades that they are.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

Also it faces backwards, so the whole ""flick fire"" thing to me doesn't appeal as much. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
