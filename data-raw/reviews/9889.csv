Leonidas is also a nice minifig who is a human/lion man but his double sided face makes him look supid or has mental problems ,his lion mask/face isnt much better so that leads me to believe that he is the supid one of his race but he does come with a very nice lion headed twin blade sword with a light sabre up the middle that is almost worth the price of the set on its on.</p><p>The chi stone/crystal is a simple one piece brick and to be honest I not know the back story to this series yet.</p>

"CapnRex101","2012-12-23T17:56:28.773Z","70001 - Crawley's Claw Ripper","<p>I was in two minds about the Legends of Chima theme prior to their release, not being entirely sure what to make of this supposed replacement for Ninjago. It has since been revealed that Ninjago will also continue alongside this theme, perhaps with some kind of integration in the future which could be interesting. Despite my reservations, I bit the bullet and picked up this set, 70001, Crawley's Claw Ripper, and I am delighted with it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box artwork is very eye-catching indeed, with a great deal of movement as Crawley drives towards the heroic Leonidas with the claws and teeth on the machine whirling wildly. The huge mouth is wide open and the tyres at the back are spinning over the rocks which form the background. In the distance we can see some mountains and a large floating rock which has the heads of each of the five tribal animals engraved upon it. The two Minifigures included, Crawley and Leonidas, are displayed in the bottom corner of the box, and along the top is a large blue strip with an animated image of one of the&nbsp;crocodile&nbsp;tribe members looking rather evil and the Legends of Chima logo.</p><p>On the reverse of the box are several images showing the features in the set and the two Minifigures in hand to hand combat for the one rock of Chi (the translucent blue rocks which seem to be what the tribes are fighting over). We can see the jaws on the Claw Ripper, the spinning teeth, the Chi storage box and the opening&nbsp;cockpit. The instructions were perfect with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces, what was particularly notable was the many advertisements which seemed to be randomly dispersed throughout each of the two booklets.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are many highly desirable parts in this set, including several brand new moulded parts, including the head pieces of each of the two Minifigures. Leonidas also carries a new sword, and one rock of Chi is included which is also brand new. There are also many olive green pieces included of various shapes and sizes which could be especially appealing to those among you who like creating MOCs, and numerous tooth parts as well which might come in handy. Last of all, we get an assortment of dark red tiles which form the tongue in the machine's jaws.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The first of the Minifigures, <b>Leonidas</b>, is a member of the lion tribe and named after the famous commander the three hundred Spartans who fought at the Battle of Thermopylae. Starting at the top, his head is constructed in two parts, the brand new lion face with a shock of orange hair and some nice detailing around his mouth of teeth and whiskers, and the actual Minifigure head beneath which is printed on both sides with his eyes and two different expressions. The eyes are visible poking through the mask and line up just as they should. His torso is printed with a muscular figure and a blue sash which runs across his chest with a blue stone on it, as well as a dark blue belt which is highly decorated. His arms are flesh in colour and his hands are white, presumably covered with hair, and on his back is a continuation of the sash and belt designs. His legs and hips are even printed as well, with some more of the blue belt and an armoured 'chiton', a skirt like garment worn by hoplite soldiers in Ancient times. He also has knee plates and some small claws printed on his feet. He&nbsp;carries&nbsp;one accessory, a huge silver greatsword which is&nbsp;decorated&nbsp;with a carving of a lion's head and a blue lightsaber blade piece which runs down the middle of the sword.</p><p>The second Minifigure is the more&nbsp;villainous <b>Crawley</b>, who is a member of the tribe of the crocodiles.&nbsp;His head is split into two pieces like Leonidas, the first of which is the brand new moulded mask which has a long snout and almost innumerable teeth, along with some dark green scales printed on it. His head piece underneath the mask is very odd in appearance, with a wide mouth filled with more teeth and two enormous yellow eyes. The head is also printed on the back with a more evil and angry expression, which translates through the mask as his eyes are narrowed. The torso is highly detailed with a scaly chest featuring a dark red rag around his shoulders and a blue gemstone of some kind hanging around Crawley's neck, much like that of Leonidas. On the back the scales and his torn red shirt are continued, which looks excellent. His arms are olive green, and the hands are dark green, which is the predominant colour scheme of the entire Minifigure and his vehicle as a whole. His hips are printed with a dark red, tooth encrusted, belt which continues on to the legs along with his scales and some claws on his feet like his feline counterpart Leonidas.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build time is approximately twenty minutes and is fairly interesting, with a nice mix of Technic and System construction techniques as well as some lovely uses of parts to create the difficult shapes which make the vehicle resemble the creature driving it. Most of all however I am very happy with the manner in which caterpillar tracks are used in order to turn the toothed wheels which spin menacingly at the front of the vehicle, at the same time as the wheels which touch the ground and create the traction to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the construction is complete, you are left with a fascinating model, which has many features considering its size and is a lot of fun to play with. The crocodile jaws at the front of the model are highly detailed and look suitably terrifying for anybody who finds themselves in front of this vehicle and they open wide to munch on an unfortunate Minifigure like Leonidas should you wish. There are three&nbsp;stickers&nbsp;used on the head which add some mechanical detail and scale designs which contribute to the overall appearance of the tank as a nightmarish crocodile! Eyes are formed by two red translucent tiles on either side of the head and there are eight teeth in his mouth which look excellent. Behind this is the mechanism for the spinning teeth feature, which can&nbsp;start&nbsp;tilted forward on either side of the head section, or hanging back to expose the head. Either way, when you begin to roll the vehicle forward the teeth move forward as well and start spinning about half way down the head. If a Minifigure gets trapped beneath the blades, it is in fact thrown out the other side with quite a lot of force, which creates the desired effect and makes the weapon look particularly savage. To keep the entire assembly from hitting the ground, are stoppers on either side of the model for both the forward and rear positions which work very well and do not take anything away from the model aesthetically either.</p><p>The cockpit in which Crawley can sit very comfortably is found in the middle of the Claw Ripper and has a large red button and a lever for controlling the machine. He has a roll cage which can be opened and closed around him which looks wonderful, and on either side of this are the two rear stoppers for keeping the spinning teeth off the ground, these in fact take the appearance of fuel tanks which is a nice touch. At the very back of the tank are the two enormous wheels which first appeared in the Power Miners theme, this time in olive green, an exclusive colour. Between these is a small red box (the bright primary colour is of no concern as it is completely obscured by the wheels). In this the rock of Chi included can be stored, or anything else you might like to put in for the fantastic Claw Ripper to haul.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this set is in fact, despite my initial reservations, a highly enjoyable set with almost limitless play potential and a rather nice appearance for display. The Minifigures are excellent, each appearing in only one other set, and Leonidas also coming in his Speedorz set. It is more than likely that Crawley will eventually appear in one of these game related models as well. Despite the nice visual design, the real appeal of this set is from a perspective of playability. It truly is something which one could play with for a long time, and all of the fun features only enhance the play experience. So all in all, while perhaps not a must have for adults, for any child or Lego fan who might buy sets for play value predominantly, this set will delight, and the price is very reasonable indeed, as the second least expensive of the entire theme so far. But, does it persuade me to continue collecting these sets? I will look into it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5

<p>
 Like the<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=5308""> Eagle Interceptor I reviewed </a>a couple of days ago, this one also takes design cues from the species that drives it, in this case crocodiles.</p>

<h2>
 Box and contents</h2>
<p>
 The box is about the size you&#39;d expect for a set of this price. It&#39;s only just occurred to me that the image on the&nbsp;top-right of the box shows the tribe the set primarily relates to, in this case crocodiles, which are, apparently, &#39;baddies&#39;. The set also contains a &#39;goodie&#39;, Leonidas from the lion tribe.</p>

<p>
 There are two instruction booklets and a small sticker sheet with three stickers. Apart from the minifig and weapon parts there are no new parts in the set, but there are a lot of olive green parts, including cheese and double cheese slopes, 2x4 tiles, and curved slopes. It&#39;s great to see more of this colour being used.</p>
<h2>
 Minifigs</h2>
<p>
 The protagonist in the set is Crawley, one of the Crocodile &#39;minions&#39; it seems. His olive green body&nbsp;with dark red highlights looks great. Here&#39;s&nbsp;a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8329635224/in/set-72157632389063403/"">view of him without his &#39;head&#39;</a>. Crawley seems like&nbsp;a strange name to me: I used to work in a town called Crawley in the south-east of England :-)</p>

 The Claw Ripper</h2>
<p>
 The Claw Ripper is a gruesome looking machine with its crocodile mouth-like front, which is hinged to open.&nbsp;The three-pronged claws on the sides rotate when the vehicle is pushed forwards, via the caterpillar tracks. Leonidas would do well to steer clear of it!</p>

<h2>
 Conclusion</h2>
<p>
 One thing I am particularly liking about the theme is that the designers have been able to let their imaginations run wild and come up with models that look like nothing we&#39;ve seen before, and like nothing that actually exists.</p>
<p>
 The minifigs in the set are again&nbsp;superb, although one shortcoming of having them all named instead of generic lions or crocodiles or whatever, is that you end up with duplicates. If you buy all the LoC sets you&#39;ll end up with three Leonidas and two Crawleys.</p>
<p>
 It&#39;s not quite as compelling as the Eagle Interceptor, but nevertheless it&#39;s another interesting set in the Legends of Chima theme.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T02:16:08.213Z","Tearing Through the Swamps of Chima, Great Set","<p><strong>Set #70001 Crawley&rsquo;s Claw Ripper: </strong>2013 Legends of Chima introduced the world to a LEGO Theme that had such great potential. A potential that only lasted for two years because in 2015 we&rsquo;ve been stuck with some of the weakest designs and sets, not a lot of them, but a fair number of the sets look to be really disappointing compared to what we started out with in 2013.</p>

<p>Enough with the lamenting of the potential though, let&rsquo;s discuss the awesome points of the set that is Crawley&rsquo;s Claw Ripper.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This is a small box. Because it&rsquo;s a small set, the design is typical from Legends of Chima Year 1. There&rsquo;s a nice CG image of Crawley&rsquo;s face in the top corner and the set is in a dynamic action pose, showing the feature of the set. There are two minifigures shown in the bottom corner, and the back gives even more details on the play features. Sadly Crawley is shown holding a weapon that he doesn&rsquo;t actually come with in the set.</p>

<p>For a set of this size you would not expect to see two manuals, but that&rsquo;s just what you get in this set. There are no numbered bags, but there are two numbered manuals. A trait shared with many of the Chima sets in 2013. The build is broken up between the two manuals, the second manual shows the cross-promotional images of other sets in the way, while the first manual is where you&rsquo;ll find the minifigure checklist for the wave.</p>

<p>There is also a sticker sheet.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find many green parts in this set, including two giant green wheels. Not the typical green found in most other LEGO sets either, but a sort of swamp green that imitates the skin of a crocodile quite nicely. The wheels are the biggest draw in this set I feel, however there are some nice treads, a lot of white fangs in the large and small size and two brown Technic axle Y shaped connectors.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>This set featured two minifigures that are more common than in other sets. One member of the lion tribe and of course the crocodile tribe member Crawley.</p>

<p>Crawley: Found exclusively in this set, Laval&rsquo;s Royal Fighter and a polybag of his own, this Minifigure is an awesome addition to your crocodile tribe. He includes the standard leg printing, a double-sided torso, a double-sided face with two different expressions and the crocodile head piece. In this set he had no accessories, the weapon shown was actually in the polybag (if I&rsquo;m not mistaken) and so he had no way to battle against the lion tribe member except with his Claw Ripper.</p>

<p>I love the print on this figure, he&rsquo;s got some great details for his scales and the torn and ragged scrap of cloth on his upper body shows that he&rsquo;s been in many a battle.</p>

<p>Leonidas: Is the most common member of the lion tribe to be found in the 2013 sets of Chima. He is like the foot soldier of the lion tribe, a warrior that appears often. In fact he also appeared in a polybag and at least two other sets besides his Speedor set in the first wave alone. He and Lennox are the most common tribesmen to own.</p>

<p>This was the second cheapest method to get him and he does not disappoint. With some great print detail on his double-sided torso, the legs and his lion head piece showing a toothy grin. He&rsquo;s made out to be a bit slower than the rest, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him. In this set, in order to battle Crawley and his menacing Claw Ripper, he includes a Valious blade.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build for this set is very interesting. The vehicle itself is very low to the ground and the build isn&rsquo;t very complex or difficult to follow. The only thing slowing you down is the odd choice of splitting it up between two manuals. The fun part is building the front claws, since they are part of a very well thought out gimmick they can be slightly tricky to line everything up properly during the build, but never fear, it isn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>

<p>You will also place a total of three stickers on the build, for some printed elements around the crocodile head. It is unfortunate that LEGO opted for this approach as opposed to giving us some printed elements, however considering the number of stickers involved it isn&rsquo;t too terrible compared to other sets.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Crawley&rsquo;s Claw Ripper is a very impressive little swamp crusher. It moves on two large wheels, if you roll it forward the claws flip forward and the treads roll. Quite a nice effect actually and it allows you to attack the Minifigures in front of you menacingly. If you roll him backwards, to retreat from another tribe vehicle like Laval&rsquo;s Royal Fighter, the claws will flip back into their non-attacking pose and still roll with the treads.</p>

<p>The mouth can open and close, but you have to do this manually, it doesn&rsquo;t open and close while you roll it along like I first thought. Still it&rsquo;s a pretty sweet looking vehicle with a simple and fun design that isn&rsquo;t hindered by the play features. As some have been shown to do in the past.</p>

<p>It also runs on Chi power, the crystal fits inside a box on the back in between the two large wheels. Small fingers won&rsquo;t have too difficult a time getting at the crystal, larger hands might however need some help accessing it.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>In my opinion I&rsquo;m glad I changed my mind about skipping this set. The vehicle is fun to play with all around and, while the minifigures are not unique or difficult to come by, for the most part. They are still common, so it does have that against it. I&rsquo;d recommend trying to track this down if you don&rsquo;t already own it, the Crocodile Tribe vehicles all look pretty impressive and they don&rsquo;t fail to disappoint. Be aware though that this is from the first wave and so has been out for two years now, which means the chances of finding it now that it is most likely retired will not be easy.</p>

<p>I do wish Crawley had a weapon accessory though, it&rsquo;s a shame that in order to get his signature weapon you need to track down the very hard to find single minifigure polybag.</p>
