<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>So, here we have the box: It's rather medium size, but flat, and rectangular. on the front, we have Lego&nbsp;Legends of Chima logo, and an artistic vision of Razar's semi-profile, all on blue backdrop, with golden lining. Below, we have an action shot, of Razar and Rizzo,&nbsp;two sneaky and slick Raven Tribe members, versus Ewar of Eagle Tribe,&nbsp;noble defender of Chi Temple. Razar is riding his machine, and distracts Ewar on his&nbsp;""speeder"", while Rizzo attempts to steal the precious Chi crystal from the shrine.&nbsp;Underneath&nbsp;we have the minifig line-up, and since this is European version of the box, there's only age range and set numer. All of this on the tropical backdrop of land of Chima, with it's lush green jungles and towering cliffs. On the back, there are some shots of play features, including the obligatory flick missles, poseable beak, wings and tail, etc.</p><p>Inside we'll find four numbered bags full of ABS plastic goodies, two lose flex tubes,&nbsp;and two instruction booklets. The last ones bear the same image as on the box, minus all the informative mumbo-jumbo. The instructions are clear, with part call outs, all displayed on solid light blue background. no fancy decorations here, so you can focus on the build. But, alas, at the end of second booklet, the despicable WIN! kid jups out and yells at you. In the middle of the&nbsp;same booklet, there&nbsp;are also miscellanous, Chima themed commercials, including the list of Minifigs. &nbsp;In the instruction booklet no. 1, we'll find the Dreaded Sticker Sheet. Yes, there are a couple stickers, but mostly, they aren't that difficult to stick.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are mostly dark bley and black pieces, with some Purple and dark red, not to mention some medium bley and dark tan, used to build the CHI shrine, plus some foliage. for further reference check the parts tab.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One of the highlights of the set, we get three minifigs, two ravens, Razar and Rizzo, and one eagle, Ewar. All have&nbsp;excellent printings on their fronts, backs, and double sided heads (The Ravens have scared&nbsp;expressions&nbsp;on the backs of their heads, while Ewar is depicted with, and without his flying goggles). Since Rizzo has a pegleg, he's the only minifig&nbsp;in the set WITHOUT leg printing.&nbsp;All wear the new armor piece with two studs at the back, and one at front. Since they're all anthropomorphic birds, they also have the new wing piece. The one downside is, that the Raven tribe fellows are not quite well armed. Ok, they have the Raider Jet, but apart from Rizzo's&nbsp; Grabberatus (which isn't much of a weapon more than a tool to steal CHI), they got no hand held weapons. I guess, that Razar would use his prosthetic hook to defend himself against Ewar's cool looking axe......</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>That's really straightforward build, not much SNOT techniques, the build is simple yet fun. First, you build the minifigs, CHI shrine, Ewar's scooter and CHI Raider's body. Next we focus on the Raider itself, by adding head with cockpit, and legs. With last bag we build the wings and tail of the raven-shaped jet, and arm it with flick-fire missles.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>What to say, we get a really nice jungle shrine with CHI crystal, A cool looking jetplane, and three super-detailed minifigs. For this price, the set is perfect for someone who wants to start their adventure in the fabled land of Chima.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A fantastic set with nice features, good play value, very cool assortment of parts, and great minifigs. Even if you're not into LoC Theme like my humble person, you find many dark red, Purple,&nbsp;black and bley&nbsp;parts for your moc. The CHI temple as whole can be used in other themes as well.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
