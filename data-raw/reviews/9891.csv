<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is packed with detail, and shows Lennox in his lion attack chasing after Crug who has just stolen the Chi from Lennox. In the background you will see Mount Cavora and plenty of plant life all around. At the top of the box you'll see a strip of blue with the Legends of Chima logo and a close-up of Lennox' face.</p><p>On the opposite side&nbsp;there are four boxes that show play possibilities and the main features of the set. And also&nbsp;something to encourage you to visit the Legends of Chima website.&nbsp;At the top of this side of the box is another logo and Lennox and Crug fighting over an orb of Chi in unachievable poses. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions are divided into two booklets, which is somewhat surprising because the set is only 24.99 USD.&nbsp;The instructions&nbsp;are&nbsp;easy to follow and had no mistakes. One thing I have noticed about the Legends of Chima theme is that all the instructions, etc. have had lots of advertisements which may have some thing to do with the fact that it is supposed to be&nbsp;TLGs ""big bang theme"" this year.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are good, but not great, though the ones that are noteworthy are great. A few of the better parts include: the ""lion  yellow"" pieces, the Chi, new teeth pieces, the wheels/tires, and technic pieces. Which is fine by me, but still not the best around.</p><p> Also the set features seven stickers, four of which make up the controls, one is on the lion head, and two are on the side turrets. I am not a huge fan of them, like I do prefer printed parts better than stickers but I am&nbsp;perfectly fine with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Both minifigs are very good, but not unique, however the great thing about Chima is that a majority of the figures are great for army building. </p><p>The hero of the set <strong>Lennox</strong> is my favorite minifig of the set. His front printing has a bandolier with some Chi strapped in&nbsp;over his chest which features a six-pack, and at the bottom of his torso the top of his belt is printed featuring the top-half of a lion head. On his legs&nbsp;he has a royal blue kilt with some minor gold detailing. His knees also have knee pads with a lion face on them. His feet&nbsp;have some claws with some white fur around them to make look more like a lion. His back printing includes the rest of the bandolier, some back muscles and&nbsp;some of his kilt. His head is also double sided as all&nbsp;Chima minifigs&nbsp;are, one side angry and the other side worried.&nbsp;His molded lion head has a brown mane and below that a dark blue crown like thing. Below his eyeholes his snout and some&nbsp;bared teeth. Truly an excellent figure. </p><p>The villain of the set <strong>Crug</strong>&nbsp;is one of the rarer&nbsp;crocs&nbsp;making a total of four appearances this year. This brown croc features plenty of muscles on his scaly chest, which also has a scar. At the bottom of his torso his belt holds some Chi and has four teeth (two on each side) strapped in. Instead of having a kilt like Lennox he has a loincloth with a vine with five teeth printed on his legs. Down on his feet he has some white claws like a real crocodile would have. On his head he has a metal jaw. (perhaps a pun on the character Jaws from the James Bond movies.) Plus some scales around his orange eyes. Like Lennox he has a double sided face with one side confident the other side surprised. His molded croc head has more scales and a more detailed metal jaw. One thing that this minifig has that Lennox doesn't is that he has&nbsp;a weapon, Slugga, is made out of six pieces. Another excellent minifig.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fun and easy though younger builders might find it difficult due to all the technic involved. The lion head is quite an interesting build with the SNOT and techniques  involved. One thing I noticed the hard way is that if you don't build the front claws correctly they will hit the ground and stop the vehicle from moving smoothly. Another thing I noticed is that you need to work the disk shooting function before it&nbsp;works well, but after that it works very well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is great with all the functions and detail, like I stated at the top all the functions work very well, here is a list of them all: the shooting disks: they work very well and shoot out of the lions mouth to hit Crug or any other pest, that is if you open the mouth :-), the flick missiles: normally I wouldn't consider this a function but the fact that they are mounted&nbsp;on moveable turrets evens it out, and finally the&nbsp;front claws: this is not much of a function however it really adds a lot to the model.&nbsp;</p><p>Also it is very fun to play with and the possibilities are endless seeing as there is a good guy and a bad guy and something for them to fight over, and I'm sure that any kid would love this.</p><p>The set also includes lots of detail not only sticker detail but brick made detail also! The driver's cabin is far more detailed than you would think, and the lion head is very detailed for a set of this size, and it features a lot of SNOT&nbsp;and clever building techniques to make a very detailed lion head.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall this set is excellent and I no doubt recommend you to get it. Whether you are an AFOL, TFOL or KFOL any body would love this set. It has great playability or would be great &nbsp;as part of a larger setup, or even a setup on it's  own! As a first set for Legends of Chima you might want to go with a smaller set but nevertheless it is excellent in almost every way.</p><p>Overall I give it a 10/10</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"MaartenRF10","2013-09-11T14:16:06.427Z","High playability","When I first saw the Chima theme (my son's favourite) I wasn't that keen on buying and trying a lot of the sets. I tried to pursue my son in wanting the LOTR of City themes. I didn't succeed and so now I've started collecting Chima sets. And I have to admit now, the Chima sets are great!<br><br>First thing that strikes is the looks of the set. It looks cool. The big wheels, large white teeth and the front that really looks like a lion's head, make it look dangerous and fierce. Opponents of the lion's tribe should be warned. The bricks and colours are a welcome change from most lego sets we own. The yellow and light orange look nice.<br><br>Playability is the sets biggest plus. There's many moving parts and there's even two ways of literally shoot at your opponents! It really invites you to play and fight between different tribes and create your own action adventure!<br><br>The unique bricks of the set (or at least of the Chima theme) don't help for a good building experience. There many places where different parts have to be connected with pins. It makes it complicated to built and sometimes hard to see where a certain part should be placed. This especially counts for younger children. My for year old son has more problems building this relatively small set, than building a Modular building.<br><br>But in this case the result makes up for the poor building experience. <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Building experience<br></li></ul><p>After having seen this set I'm eager to try other Chima sets. They will count for hours of fun playing with my son.<br></p>
