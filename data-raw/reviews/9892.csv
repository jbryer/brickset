"LegoCam567","2013-01-01T12:10:31.567Z","A great set to start you of with chima...","Eris' Eagle Interceptor:<br><br>Wow. That explains this set in one word. I was at my local toys'r'us trying to choose between this and crawleys claw ripper. I am glad I bought this one, now onto the minifigs.<br><br>Eris is the exclusive minifig in this set, although she probably will re-apear in the summer wave. The printing is beutiful, with ornate details everywhere. Of course she includes the new wings, armor and head/ helmet peice which just make the figure what it is. There are also two different face expressions. I also like the fact that you can change the wings around for different flight positions. She also has a new weapon, which looks like an axe. Overall a great fig, i'd give it 9.5 out of 10. <br><br>Razar is really cool, with some awesome metallic printing. he has a nice silver hook hand, black wings and the unique raven head/ helmet peice. And the different expresions on the face are cool to. his Chi sword is a nice weapon for him. A really great figure but getting a bit common, I'd say 8.5 out of 10.<br><br>Rizzo is pretty awesome, especially with his peg leg and a damaged eye. The face expressions are really good on this figure, as he is missing an eye. It does lack leg printing; because of the peg leg, but if you get two of another raven then you could just take of the peg leg and put it on the other set of legs. nice mettalic detail, and a cool gun/ cannon weapon, I give it 8.5 out of ten.<br><br>Now the wonderful set. Firstly, you get a small raven glider which isn't the best, but gives the ravens something to help them. It features poseable wings, two Chi swords that act as some kind of blaster or talon, two engine booster and two sticker details. A nice little adition that increases the playability of the set; 7 out of&nbsp; 10.<br><br>Finally we see the Eagle Interceptor, the main part of the set. It is decently sized, and isn't to heavy that it's not swooshable. It does look a lot like an eagle which is one of the main boxes it should tick. It does include 5 stickers and 4 printed peices.<br><br>&nbsp;The cockpit is just big enough, features one sticker, has two eyes/ blaster cannons and can dettatch from the main body to then become an escape pod. <br><br>The legs at first looked very bulky for an eagle, but once it's finished you see why they are that big - they have rocket boosters/ jet engines on the bottom (two on each leg, printed), and engines need to be big enough for the vehicle. Plus it needs to stand up on something big enough to keep it up. the talons also move, but the two shorter outside ones do tend to fall of. The legs also articulate on click hinges, and very well.<br>The wings pose well, and feature a flick missile on each one, and two stationary red cannons on each wing (that do sometimes fall of). The feathers also move, and feature new peices. Eris' wings also attatch onto the interceptor's wings while she is in the driver's seat.<br>There is an engine on the main body, that has a feature nearby it. Simply lift up the big blue peice to reveal a cargo/ prison area. You can either put the one Chi crystal and Eris' weapon in there, or a raven prisoner (the wings must be removed).<br>Finally you have the poseable tail, with the same feather peices as the wings. <br>I'll give the main part of the set 9.5 out of 10.<br><br>So - a great set that i reccomend you buy if :<br>you are new to chima, as it is a nice size with enough features and figs but not to expensive either. <br><br>If you are an eagle fan (like me) it's probably a must have. <br><br>If you want it for play/ features then it's pretty good; equal forces, nice amount and type of features, and many possible storys/ scenarios to play to. <br><br>Overall it is just awesome, and i can't wait to get more sets ( which i will reveiw). <br><br>Well thank you for reading and please rate this reveiw as helpful as i will make more if you do. <br>I know it was rather long, but i just wanted to get into all the details. Thank you very much!<br>- Cameron =D<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

Many appeared to be a bit strange, but&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=70003-1"" title=""View set details"">70003</a> Eris&#39; Eagle Interceptor stood out as looking like the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>
 I was therefore very pleased when it was included in the bunch of LoC sets&nbsp;Kim from LEGO sent us to review just before Christmas.</p>
<p>
 From the initial pictures we saw, some&nbsp;remarked that the legs were a bit fat and un-eagle-like. Read on to find out why they are, and whether I agree.</p>
<hr />

<h2>
 Box and contents</h2>
<p>
 The box is square, and as <em>atkinsar&nbsp;</em>noted in his <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=5246"">review of 70004</a>, it&#39;s smaller than you&#39;d expect for a &pound;30 set. Personally I think this is a good thing, although as I don&#39;t generally keep boxes forever, it&#39;s not that relevant to me.</p>
<p>
 The front shows the Interceptor chasing the much smaller raven glider and identifies the three minifigs as Eris (Eagle), Razar and Rizzo (Ravens). Have you noticed how the characters&#39; names begin with the first letter of their species&#39; name? :-)</p>

 The back of the box&nbsp;shows what moves and what comes off.</p>

<h2>
 The minifigs</h2>
<p>
 There are three, one eagle and two ravens. Both species are similar and share the same armour and wings. The heads are different, of course. Here are the ravens, Razar (right) and Rizzo. I believe, but I don&#39;t know for sure, that the 1x1 round tile on their chests represents CHI, which is the element/crystal/whatever that&nbsp;they are squabbling about, and which provides a &#39;life force&#39; in Chima (or something like that!). They each have weapons, which are not shown in these photos (but you can <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322503552/in/set-72157632376015650"">see them here</a>)</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8321441957/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""281"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8081/8321441957_ca249273df.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 This shot of their backs shows how the wings are attached to the bodies. The armour has 2 studs on the back, upon which two 1x1 clips are attached. The heads are printed on the backs, with a different expression. The raven head pieces are very well printed in metallic paint&nbsp;and look superb.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322502214/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""281"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8322502214_6b09c2865f.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 Here is Eris, who&#39;s constructed the same as the ravens, but with a different shaped head.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322502770/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""500"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8353/8322502770_b858129148.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 Her (not his, as&nbsp;it&#39;s been pointed out in the comments)&nbsp;head is also printed on both sides but her facial expression is virtually identical on the back, her eyes are slightly wider, that&#39;s the only difference I can see (I didn&#39;t notice at first so didn&#39;t photograph the back of his head as a result)</p>
<p>

<h2>
 Construction</h2>
<p>
 Bag one builds the minifigs, the raven glider,&nbsp;and the &#39;cockpit&#39;/head of the&nbsp;Interceptor and&nbsp;contains a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8321439679/in/set-72157632376015650/"">number of new parts</a>, and old parts in new colours, including <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8321440061/in/set-72157632376015650/"">2x4 and 1x2 bricks in &#39;Dark Azure&#39;</a> or &#39;ADU blue&#39;.</p>
<p>
 Here&#39;s the raven glider with Razar on it. The wings can be rotated&nbsp;and&nbsp;angled to pretty much any position you like. I believe the weapons at the front, and the one on the right of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322503552/in/set-72157632376015650"">this picture</a>, i.e. those fitted with lightsabre blades, are called &#39;CHI weapons&#39;</p>

<p>
 Here&#39;s the cockpit of the Interceptor. It&#39;s a very nice design and made to look, of course, like an eagle&#39;s head, and I think it succeeds, particularly thanks to the beak.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322500738/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""331"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8079/8322500738_5dcfe0d5a6.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 Eris fits comfortably in it but you have to remove the clips and wings from her back. Provision has been made to put them elsewhere on the model as you will see below.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8321440575/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""473"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8321440575_410b738c4e.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 The finished model looks excellent. The cockpit attaches to the body by way of click-hinges so can be detached relatively easily. The legs do look a little stubby from the front&nbsp;and if you were building a model of an eagle they would look very out of place. However this is not a model of an eagle...</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322501712/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""281"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8504/8322501712_0f09a415cc.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 ...it&#39;s a model of a flying machine made to look like an eagle and if you turn it upside down the reason for the fat legs becomes apparent: they are the propulsion units! The printed upside-down tiles help represent this. It&#39;s interesting that these pieces are printed, but others in the set are stickered. I guess it all came down to budget.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmillington/8322504294/"" title=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor by hmillington, on Flickr""><img alt=""70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor"" height=""342"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8500/8322504294_2a2d031449.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 The product shot shown on the set detail page (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=70003-1"" title=""View set details"">70003</a>) shows the feather pieces a bit too spread out and consequently they look a bit sparse. But they are of course adjustable so once you&#39;ve move them in a bit it looks much better. This shot also shows where Eris&#39; wings are mounted when not on her. The large dark blue piece on&nbsp;the back hinges up to reveal a storage space, although I&#39;m not sure what goes in it, other than the CHI crystal (shown in <a href=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8215/8300508126_8e3aba200f_z.jpg"">this picture </a>from DrDave&#39;s review)</p>

<h2>
 Conclusion</h2>
<p>
 This is an excellent set and, as suspected having examined the hi-res pictures we now have of the Chima sets, one of the best&nbsp;of the first batch. I can exclusively reveal that this set was designed by none other than Mark Stafford, which goes some way to explain why it&#39;s so cool :-)</p>
<h4>
 What I liked</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  The concept of a flying machine made to look like the species that flies it is interesting and has been pulled off very well.&nbsp;We don&#39;t make aircraft that look like us though, do we? :-)</li>
 <li>
  The legs do appear too fat at first, but once you understand what they represent, they look fine.</li>
 <li>
  The minifigs are superb, and even includes&nbsp;a female (even if I didn&#39;t notice at first!)</li>
 <li>
  The raven glider adds a fun play element to the set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
 What I didn&#39;t like</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  As <em>atkinsar </em>mentioned in his <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=5246"">review of 70004, <em>Watz&#39; Pack Tracker</em></a>, a lot of attention has been spent on the front of that model but not so much on the back. This model doesn&#39;t suffer from that problem quite so much, but the backs of the legs are not &#39;clad&#39; in dark blue like the sides so the yellow bricks&nbsp;and grey plates stick out like a sore thumb when you view it from the rear.<br />
  &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
 I had hoped that I would not need to buy Legends of Chima sets, but having built this&nbsp;model&nbsp;and being very impressed with it, it&#39;s&nbsp;quickly become apparent that will not be the case: In fact I already have 7 of them!</p>
<p>
 If you are sceptical about the theme and not sure whether you&#39;ll like it,&nbsp;this would be a good first set to pick up to see the best it has to offer both in terms of the minifigs and the model. Highly recommended!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-12-28T20:40:43.757Z","Chima Eagle Tribe Princess?","<p><strong>Set #70003 Eris' Eagle Interceptor: </strong>Legend of Chima was originally not something on my radar, in fact I was kind of trying to keep the number of Themes I started from 2013 down. It was really good I changed my mind, this set is one of the best sets in my opinion from 2013. I don't really enjoy the overall design of the lion tribe vehicles or, really, any of the land based animal tribes vehicles. Gorzan's Gorilla Striker and Cragger's Command Ship are two that aren't too bad, the designs of the others however are just not my cup of tea.</p>
<p>The Eagle tribe is just pure win, even some of their more questionably designed sets are still fun to look at. Anyway, it's taken me a while, but here are my thoughts on this awesome set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Having already recycled the box, unlike most of the sets still waiting in the review que I'm afraid I can't say much about the overall box design of the sets. However I will say this, they draw your eye and do a pretty decent job of showcasing what you get. Much like many of LEGO's box designs in recent years.</p>
<p>The instruction manual is a pure work of art, it allows you to follow the steps of the build quite nicely and shows off the great design cues for the Legends of Chima Theme. The only flaw I have with them is that the Mini-Figure checklist is situated right slap in the middle of the manual instead of at the end, making it break up the flow of the build slightly. Still there's a lot of good outweighing this one flaw in the design choice.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The pieces in this set, where do I begin? Ok first off there are a large number of the new feather pieces, 9 in dark blue and 2 in a lighter blue colour. The set introduces a LEGO Technic socket style piece for LEGO axles with a clip on the end. At least I believe this part is a new one for this set, it's used to make the talons for the eagle, and there's one spare included which gives you 5 in total. This is an interesting new piece that opens up a world of potential when MOCing.</p>
<p>There are also ball and socket joints along with the click style joints, and a slew of other parts that naming them all would take far too long, mostly because I'd have to track down exact names for them. Suffice it to say this is a great set for parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Chima Mini-Figures are some of the best, the level of detail and consistency of the prints between each set just stands out as some of the best that LEGO have ever produced. And 2014 seems to be another year for great Chima Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>Who do you get in this set?</p>
<p>First is Razar, also found in Razar's CHI Raider; this Mini-Figure is a member of the Raven tribe. The Raven and Eagle tribe members are the ones I am consistently impressed by and really love, each one has its own unique look. Razar is no different, he's got a double-sided torso, a double-sided facial print, leg printing and the special chest armor piece with rear studs to attach the wings. He's also got a small vehicle in this set and a large silver bladed weapon.</p>
<p>Next we have Rizzo (who shares a name with a Muppet), this member of the Raven Tribe continues all of the impressive level of detail in the Chima Mini-Figures and goes one step further by incorporating the LEGO Peg-leg leg piece. Unfortunately this means that he doesn't have leg printing and I believe is the only Chima Mini-Figure without leg printing.</p>
<p>Besides missing a leg he's also got a metal eye-patch, most of the Raven tribe are missing body parts and have replaced them with shiny metal things, a character trait of all the Ravens. He's got this odd weapon using the rubbery beak piece from Razcal's Glider in black, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be some sort of energy blasting device or a sensor unit for tracking Chi. Maybe it's both, it's a really strange looking weapon.</p>
<p>Eris is the Eagle Tribe member being chased by the two Ravens. She's the first female Chima Mini-Figure to be made available with Crooler being number 2, I believe she's the daughter of Ewald and her print is just as detailed and impressive as the other Eagle tribe members. I'd go into greater detail, but that could take a long while because I have a hard time reigning in my urge to gush endlessly over these prints.</p>
<p>She's got this double-sided axe thing... I honestly don't know it's name, all I know is that it's a nice unique weapon built out of a brown bar and a golden sculpted piece that works nicely. You can attach two Chi studs onto both sides showing that it can be powered up to do even more damage.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set has 3 numbered bags, each one builds a different section of the Eagle Interceptor. The 1st bag has a smaller build besides the front/cockpit section of Eris' vehicle. This is a simple little Raven Tribe glider or something that sort of looks like a small raven when finished.</p>
<p>Bag 2 builds the body of the vehicle and bag 3 does the wings and legs. This build is really impressive, the techniques used are great and as you work to build the Interceptor you get to see the Eagle part grow quite nicely. In my opinion this is the best vehicle out of the first batch of Eagle based vehicles. And the build just enhances this opinion.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The small Raven tribe vehicle isn't as good as Razcal's Glider, still it works as a swifter moving assault vehicle to steal the Chi from Eris. I like it.</p>
<p>The Eagle Interceptor is pure poetry in LEGO form. It is the closest to looking like a real eagle poised to strike when built, and the features work well and don't hinder it too much. I will admit though that after a few months of sitting on the shelf I've noticed that the balljointed areas for the wings seem to be a bit loose and don't hold poses as well as they did. Possibly because the wing builds are too heavy for the single joints.</p>
<p>This model is just all around great though, even the fact that it features flick-fire missiles doesn't bother me too much. The cockpit even can detach to form a smaller escape pod vehicle for Eris. The talons on the Interceptor can be posed individually and all of the feathers can be moved around to strike any kind of pose you'd like within their range of motion of course. The one downside, you have to detach Eris' wings in order for her to fit inside the cockpit, the wings are then incorporated into the build of the vehicle attached as extra feathers for the Interceptor's wings... They just don't fit in to the overall design of the wings and I think you could leave them off.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, if like me you've not really felt the Legends of Chima Theme and are still, even now shying away from it I'd say you have to at least do yourself a favour and pick this set up. At 40$ it is a great deal, the Mini-Figures are chock full of detail and the set itself is really one of the best from the Chima Theme. I'd say it stands up there with Cragger's Command Ship and Gorzan's Gorilla Striker as must own from this Theme.</p>
<p>I would note though that there are a few slight problems, these can easily be corrected by modifying the build slightly if you'd care to try. The mobility of the legs is a bit limited due to how it's built, still they make it quite sturdy and it will stand up in any pose you'd care to place it as long as you don't overbalance one side.</p>
<p>Definitely recommend this one for fans of great looking models, even if you don't like the Chima Theme I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking this one up. (Plus it'll look great facing off against the new Baraptor vehicle coming in 2014's first wave of Chima sets.)</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"Shib","2015-02-07T17:17:17.33Z","A Single Set That Made Me Love The Theme","<p>When the Chima&nbsp;theme first came&nbsp;out I really didn&#39;t like it, at all. I accepted it as a theme fit for purpose, entertaining kids, but completely not for me. It wasn&#39;t until I picked this set up in a sale on a complete whim that it started to make sense.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art is completely fitting to the theme, and looks fairly standard to what you&#39;d expect. My only real constant gripe with current Lego sets is that the pictures of the set almost never do the finished product justice. I wouldn&#39;t say its absolutely why I didn&#39;t have much interest in Chima to begin with, but I do think it is part of the reason.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow as is generally the case, only towards the end of the main build did I find I was having to double check things like positioning, but I think that says more about me than anything else.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m an absolute sucker for a really good colour palette, and this set definitely hit the mark on that front. It has a beautiful mix of blues which are complemented excellently by the whites. If you want a good parts pack for blue spaceships this set is a great choice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are a big part of the Lego experience for me, it&#39;s another part if the reason this set jumped out of the Chima&nbsp;theme to me. I have a keen interest in birds so figured that even if I liked nothing else of the set the bird themed minifigure parts could be useful for all sorts of MOCs. While I&#39;m not a massive fan of the wings attaching to the armour, the wing pieces themselves are fantastic. The fact that Eris has to have them removed to fit into the cockpit shows the biggest weakness of the minifigure design, but it&#39;s very easy to overlook,&nbsp;all things considered.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was really where I was won over on the Chima theme. The set has a lot of nice techniques to give the model both some great play features and a very satisfying finish. At first look it seems a very straight forward build, but when you actually approach it there&#39;s far more than it seems.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Having previously worked with birds of prey I was really pleased with all the proportions of the finished model. I suspect quite a bit of time was spent getting the shape accurate to the source of an eagle. I genuinely expected to quickly break the model apart for parts, but it won me over and is now one of my favourite sets of it&#39;s price range.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set actually changed the way I look at what I want from a Lego set,&nbsp;and I think that really says it all. Definitely a gem of the theme, with great playability and actually a nice small display piece. I absolutely love it, and as a result it made me want all the other bird mech sets of the Chima theme.</p>

"Faefrost","2017-01-17T05:06:59.09Z","An exceptionally cool set, one of the best of the Chima line","<p>This set just strikes that perfect balance between organic animal shaping and high tech SciFi&nbsp;fighter. The result is one of the most swooshable sets Lego has ever put out. Fans of the classic Buck Rogers TV show may feel really at home with this one as it calls to mind Hawk&#39;s Fighter from that show. Those same bird lines and grace. The set makes extremely good use of all the pieces that were new for Chima, especially the feathers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>The box is pretty standard first wave Chima. Blue trim, an Eagle looking down from the corner. The actual main picture is ok and does the job, but feels a little flat. Not as dynamic as it could have been. The back shows off the features nicely. The instructions are a staples and mutilated booklet as always. Stickers are minimal, being just the 4 2x2 round tile decorations 2 stripes on the Raven flyer and Eris&#39;s cockpit panel.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The set comes with three minifigs. While I am not a huge fan of Chima figures, these are some of the better ones. I do love how they incorporated wings onto the figures using the armor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eris the Eagle - One of our main characters and the main draw for the set. She is gorgeously printed. front and back printing plus leg and toe printing. She has a dual sided head, which never made much sense to me as they are always fully covered up by the masklike animal heads? Similarly most of the nice torso printing is covered up by her pearlgold armor, which needs to be in place to mount her wings. There is a ton of detail work on this figure. It&#39;s gorgeous. (Now if only someone could explain why a female bird has breasts and a belly button?)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rizzo the Raven - The cyborged out raven with the metal peg leg. He is a cool figure. Once again incredibly detailed torso. No leg printing. His face has the markings for his metalic implants and eye. His left hand is a hook. he wears silver armor and has black wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Razar - The Raven General. Once again a stunning figure. He stands out with some striking red markings on his face and torso. he also has leg and hip printing. Once again silver armor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>This set was a first wave Chima set so introduced a ton of new Chima specific parts. From the Chi pieces to the new feathers in Dark Blue, Azure and Black. Lots of other little goodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build and Model -&nbsp;</strong>The build is pretty straightforward. No shocking surprises. The weakest area is probably the legs as they are a bit thick and don&#39;t move or pose well. The shaping of the head and its beak is fantastic. And how all the wings go together is also great. The ship has a place to clip Eris&#39;s wings while she is seated in the cockpit. The small Raven flyer is meh, but it is not better or worse than the dozens of other similar little adversary flyers you likely have. It does the job and is better than most.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>A fantastic set and amazing value for its price. One that I still keep out on display years later. Just a fun fantasy SF ship. (Oh and comic book Super Hero fans. This makes a great Hawkman ship as well.)&nbsp;</p>
