"Firox_5000","2014-01-19T16:45:28.263Z","Attack of the wolves ","This was the first Chima set I bought and despite not expecting much from the theme or set, I was rather impressed.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>Box/packaging</b></div><div>The set comes in medium sized square box which is quite thick at the back two. There's one instruction msnual and also three numbered bags for the model, building up the set in phases.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build itself takes around 30 minutes and is rather simple in the way it builds up with different bring added to the model. Whilst not the most creative build, it's still an exciting one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The figures&nbsp;</b></div><div>There are three figures included in this ode, two from the wolf tribe and one from the eagles.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first is Wakz himself, who comes with a double sided wolf face with a serious face on one and a ferocious on the other with sharp jaws and yellow eyes. The torso features silver and dark red printing on the front with blue chi printing too whilst at the back there's silver fur printing. The figure also wears a silver chest plate with a light blue chi piece included too. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The figure also includes red and grey leg printings which were do resemble wolf legs in Lego form and have a lot of detail to them. There's also the wolf head piece which features mostly dark grey with some light grey, whilst obtaining a chima lightsaber like sword too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second figure is Winzar the wolf, who features a lighter grey head piece lots of red scars on the right side of his head with further mouth detailing as well. The figure two facial expressions, one with a happy'ish face and the other a ferocious one. This figure also appears to be in the wars, seeing as he only has one eye open on each side, the other presumably blinded in battle.</div><div><br></div><div>There's also chest printing on the front of the torso with chi printed too , whilst the back just resembles the chests behind printing wise. The figures leg printing includes a mixture of feet and dark red printing, which like the other figure is very impressive.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third and final figure is Equila the eagle, who features a rather large and rather long headpiece with beak and dot patterns printed. There's also facial expressions too, which one is neutral with the other showing attack mode.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The figures torso features chest printing and a golden item with chi included on the front of the torso, whilst this golden item continues at the back of the figure.his legs feature feet printing as well as lower printing of the belt from the torso piece, making the very nicely decorated.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another notable thing is the golden chest plate which features white wings printed at the back making the figure look more complete. He also includes a sword like object where the top resembles an eagle. Overall the figures in this set, have superb detail and printing on them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The set</b></div><div>The only object included is the fair sized wolf packer vehicle which is packed with lots of details throughout, which includes the way the front has been designed to resemble the face of a wolf. This is achieved excellently, from the black wedge brick as a nose to the wingless and angle parts which make the wolf eyes of the vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There's enough room at the gap to fit a wolf figure where behind lies a shooter blaster with a flag with a wolf like logo included, which adds more to the play value and fires much better than flick fire missiles. At the back is a chain with spikes, which can wind up at the back of the vehicle and also some chi hidden beneath the weapon also.</div><div><br></div><div>Other features include fire exhausts at the side of the tracker, the rather large spiky wheels and also that the mouth piece at the front of the vehicle opens and closes when the vehicle goes along, which is another nice addition to the vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion&nbsp;</b></div><div>Overall, a pretty good model, it features some excellent figures which include some of the best detailing we've seen yet and hopefully we will see more figures on this great scale in future ranges.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set itself whilst packed with loads play features, is very good, but not amazing. This is due to the appearances around the set as whilst the front has been executed well, the back of the model feels quite dull and boring and whilst most of the action is happening at the front, it would've been nice to see a few more design elements at the back, making it look a bit more interesting.</div><div><br></div><div>If the back had more features and the price was £25, as I consider £30 to be too much really for the size of the model, I would have probably given it full marks, but it's still a pretty good one which I would recommend buying if you're in to Chima or Lego jungle and animal themes.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Odeinoichus","2016-01-01T20:46:29.347Z","2013 Began with a Bang!","<p><strong>Set #70004 Wakz&rsquo; Pack Tracker: </strong>The Legends of Chima Theme was first introduced in 2013. I feel as if I&rsquo;ve said that before, of course this makes some sense. Anyway the Legends of Chima Theme started with some really great vehicle designs, most of them are actually great designs, with some impressive build ideas.</p>

<p>This is the first wolf tribe vehicle and is it something you want to track down now that Chima is sadly going to come to an end? Well read on and find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Wakz is pictured in the top corner of the box, showcasing this member of the wolf tribe up-close and personal. The box shows the set quite effectively, and all three minifigures are shown by name in the bottom right corner. The back shows all of the features of the set, really this design is great fun because of the dark blue colour scheme and the all-around play features of the set being shown in fun and dynamic ways.</p>

<p>The instructions for this set are large, they feature the steps of the build broken up by the three numbered bags in the set. It features the standard cross-promotional images in the back and the minifigure checklist in the middle of the booklet. The steps are not too difficult, however there are some areas of the build that involve technic pieces being angled in a certain way that could be slightly tricky to maintain until everything aligns into place and snaps/clicks together properly. The instructions themselves however aren&rsquo;t too terribly difficult to follow.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts in this set feature some standard and not so standard pieces. However there are a lot of technic based pieces and there are also some giant wheels. The best part in this set in my opinion is the printed flag with the Wolf Tribe emblem on it. It might seem like a poor choice for best part, however the fact that this flag isn&rsquo;t a sticker, but a printed element makes it stand out to me more than many others.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Three in this set, two wolf tribe members and an eagle tribe warrior.</p>

<p>Winzar: This member of the Wolf Tribe has been reviewed before. He comes in multiple sets and here there are no changes in torso printing, leg printing or face printing. One eye has been rendered useless with awesome scarring and claw mark prints on the head piece and face. Winzar is a pretty impressive looking Minifigure. He comes with the scimitar piece from LEGO Indiana Jones for his weapon, oddly enough LEGO included an extra in the bag with mine. I am not sure if this is intentional, however it means Winzar can dual wield scimitars to fight the other tribes.</p>

<p>Wakz: The eldest wolf in the tribe, Wakz has seen many seasons and many battles. His torso print shows this by including torn claw marks in his clothing. His leg printing includes some patches of lighter grey fur to indicate his age and his double-sided head has a beard of light grey fur as well as the head piece. Wakz is a pretty nifty looking character, his weapon interestingly is the Vengious of Honour, a gift from the croc tribe.</p>

<p>Equila: This member of the eagle tribe looks just as impressive as all the rest, with the double-sided torso, leg printing and double-sided face. One side has a pair of goggles on, while the other does not. Equila looks pretty ripped with some great muscles on his torso indicating that he is strong enough to do battle against both wolf tribe members and steal the Chi crystal from the Pack Tracker without needing a vehicle of his own.</p>

<p>His accessory is the dual-bladed axe head on a grey pole, we&rsquo;ve seen this weapon before with Eris if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, so it isn&rsquo;t unique to him.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>As noted before the build for this set is part of three numbered bags. The first bag includes our three minifigures and the pieces necessary to build the central torso of the vehicle, or what I assume would be considered the central torso.</p>

<p>Bag number two bulks up the main body of the vehicle and includes the lower chassis with the wheel rigging/axles, this builds more onto the vehicle and can be quite satisfying. Though as mentioned before the build for the wheel/axles is angled instead of straight and needs to be lined up properly before the vehicle can be finished. The wolf jaw is also built here fully and it will feature heavily into the play features of the set.</p>

<p>Bag number three uses the four big wheels and finishes the vehicle build by including the weapon in the back. I found the build from this set to be pretty satisfying all around. It&rsquo;s a nice solid vehicle design, and while the wheels&rsquo; axles need to be placed just right to avoid anything from being out of alignment. It&rsquo;s pretty great all around and should be praised for the design choices here.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Wakz&rsquo; Pack Tracker is a Wolf Tribe vehicle. It is built in the shape of a wolf, or at least the head of one. And is a pretty impressive looking model once you finish it. It is large, the angled axles allow the main body to sit up at an angle so that the wolf jaw is low to the ground to get at Chi crystals or minifigures.</p>

<p>The play features for this vehicle include a chain on the end that works as a tail, and can be used as a weapon. On the back is a large missile launcher, and when you roll the vehicle on its wheels the jaw will open and close with each rotation.</p>

<p>The model is very well designed and I do enjoy it. However I will admit that the pilot section is a bit flawed, the front end of the vehicle makes a very convincing wolf head design, with some great tricks to make the ears and the eyebrows. Unfortunately if you put the pilot in the seat it can be extremely difficult to get him to fit, just make sure the figure isn&rsquo;t holding a weapon and it&rsquo;ll work just fine.</p>

<p>All in all a really great model and a truly fun vehicle build.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of the wolf tribe you&rsquo;ll want to pick up everything you can from them and this is a pretty impressive build, the wolf head cockpit looks great and doesn&rsquo;t feature any stickers for detailing, as some vehicles have used. I would strongly recommend picking up this awesome set if you still can, being from 2013 it has retired and isn&rsquo;t that easy to come by. If you came late to the Chima party, know this, 2013 is a very good year and I will recommend many of the sets from that year mostly because they really show off the best designs from LEGO in this Theme.</p>

<p>Wakz can be gotten for cheaper if you&rsquo;re just looking for the minifigure, but I have to say, why just get the minifig? His vehicle is awesome and it will look great charging into battle alongside the Combat Lair.</p>
