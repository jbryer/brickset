"TheFadedTBCap","2013-06-25T14:58:19.43Z","Good Addition to the Chima Theme","This is a good set and a great addition to the Legends of Chima theme.&nbsp; The build incorporate some nice techniques using technic parts and sideways building.&nbsp; The gun can raise with with rotating disc and once its up it can spin and move slightly up and down.&nbsp; The turret can than be spun with another rotating disc located by the guns cockpit.&nbsp; The lion head of this vehicle is very well designed and looks fantastic.&nbsp; The mouth on this head opens and closes enough to put a minifigure unlucky enough to fall inside.&nbsp; However, the entrance to this ""prison"" is blocked by a supporting beam, which can make it hard to access (not a big problem, though).&nbsp; A minifigure fits comfortably inside the drivers seat.&nbsp; At the back of this set is a fold out computer/map which is applied by a sticker, but it does look very good and adds a nice feature to this set.&nbsp; The minifigures included in this set are Laval, Longtooth, and Crawley.&nbsp; All these minifigures are extremely detailed.&nbsp; All feature torsos with back printing and double sided heads with their main emotions coming from their eyes (because that's all that can been seen through there masks) showing an angry/determined and scared face.&nbsp; Laval is decorated in blue Lion robes with golded details as well as a neat armor piece with a navy blue cape.&nbsp; He comes with a cool sword which is new to Chima and is really awesome.&nbsp; Longtooth has muscular lion chest with claw scars across printed on his torso.&nbsp; It has a gold and brown belt which continues on to his legs which than have blue and gold details.&nbsp; He comes with the same armor Laval does, which looks great, but limits the minifigures arm motion preventing him from moving his arm backwards.&nbsp; Crawley head shows an array of teeth as well as cool bumps on the back.&nbsp; He has a red rag covering the top of his chest and back by his necklace which holds the spot to put Chi in.&nbsp; His torso looks muscular.&nbsp; His legs have a red belt like thing that continues to the top of his legs.&nbsp; He comes with a brick built gun, which is very cool.<br><br>Pros:<br>The tank is a good size<br>Turret raises, rotates, and spins<br>Rolls well<br>Lion detailing looks wonderful<br>Computer/map can fold out at the back of the vehicle<br>Mouth opens and closes and can fit one minifigure inside (prison)<br>Great minifigures<br>Comes with some cool pieces as well as some new ones<br>Cool building techniques<br><br>Cons:<br>Armor prevents the minifigures' arms from moving backwards<br>Needs an enemy vehicle to fight against<br>Playability is low because I can't think of where to use a lion tank or animal minifigures outside the&nbsp; land of Chima<br><br>Overall, I give it 8/10 because playability is low.&nbsp; This is a solid set, but it needs something to fight against.&nbsp; It does come with some good parts.&nbsp; I recommend this set to Chima collectors or people looking for good parts and have money to spend on this set.<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,2,4
"MaartenRF10","2013-09-13T09:15:52.98Z","Not the most solid set","<p>This is actually the first time ever I was disappointed by a set. Looking at this set suggest a high level of playability. With the big rotating caterpillar tracks, the mouth being able to open and close and the turret that can move in many ways. Well, let&#39;s start with a positive aspect. The turret is the best! It moves up and down (in two ways, both the arm on which the turret stands and the turret itself), it moves 360 degrees round what makes it possible to aim backwards as well, and the firing mechanism rotates. As for the mouth, that is quite hard to reach and open or close. And the caterpillars do move, but they don&#39;t move very smoothly and sometimes, especially when moving backwards, stop moving at all (or at least some of them). The biggest disadvantage of the vehicle is that there&#39;s no place the grab it to move it.<br />
<br />
Building experience is ok. A lot of technics are used, not really what I enjoy most, but that&#39;s personal. I do feel this is not the most solid structure and while building certain parts were falling apart every now and then.<br />
<br />
As the other Chima sets, this one looks great again. The resemblance of the lions head is striking, the colours used are nice.<br />
<br />
I think that if you&acute;re a Chima fan or if you want to start collecting this theme, Laval&#39;s Royal Fighter is not the set you want to start with. There&#39;s many sets that are better and have a higher playability. And are cheaper as well.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-09-02T05:48:31.25Z","Pretty interesting and weird design concept. but i think it turns out to be a fine set. ","<p>Figures - Laval and longtooth look great with the armour and cape. crawley is a more simple figure, but having a bad guy adds some play value of course.</p>

<p>Building the set. Now i really don&#39;t like technic stuff and this set was full of that. once that&#39;s over it becomes a little more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Parts - Teeth, Treads, Wheels here. Solid stuff here.</p>

<p>Play value - I think the function of the cannon going up and being able to spin is very fun. you can also put crawley in the lion head. again, china designers did a great job with the animal head. big shame this theme ended a bit too early imo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finished model is not something to use as a display model imo. looks kinda weird.</p>

<p>PPP Here is pretty good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall would i reccomend this set - As a playset? YES. Great as a playset. As a display model? not so much.&nbsp;</p>
