"xDeadpoolx","2013-03-25T08:54:18.713Z","With great playability comes an even better looking boat...","<span lang=""EN-GB""><p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">I bought this set because my son is wild about crocodiles. The choice was fairly simple since the set was already 50% off which still means a 45 euro setback. I do like the Chima sets a tad better than the Ninjago theme for the sole reason that it seems a bigger adventure with lots of animal characters. I really hope they will add some cool temples in the future. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT""></p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">But back to this set that somehow didnâ€™t get any user reviews yet. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT""></p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">Minifigs:</p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">One of the downsides of a line that targets kids is the use of the same figures. Still you will get three exclusive figures. But again we get Leonidas. And to be honest, he still looks like a simpleton. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT""></p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">The build:</p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">Since the hull itself is one massive piece the rest is fairly simple to construct. No weird techniques or anything. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT""></p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">Playability:</p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">The set looks fantastic and there are tons of play features that make the set outstanding. There are some issues with small parts falling of now and then (the boats, the teeth and the green round parts). But there is so much going on that these are minor complaints. </p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT""></p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">Conclusion:</p>
<p dir=""LTR"" align=""LEFT"">A great set for the kids and it has this really cool design so that even an adult would love to display this set. Since I got it cheaper than normal I guess the price is more than right but even when it did cost 90 euro it would be okay because the hull itself is one massive piece with 608 other pieces to build with. The only thing that would have made this the best set ever for kids is when they would have given the Lions a bigger vehicle than these flimsy little boat thingamajings. </p></span>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Branko","2013-06-07T01:21:40.717Z","It Floats on Water!","<p>Mark Stafford (the designer) was quite disappointed that this box did 
not carry the 'floats on water' logo but it most certainly does! It is a
 fairly simple build for the size, but it's a very nice play-set that even looks good as a display piece with other Chima sets.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>When 
the tilt-rotor craft is mounted on the back of the boat, the rotors 
touch the water so that they turn as you push the boat through the 
water.</li><li>Lots of nice minifigures, I just love the Chima heads.<br></li><li>Unique colour palette that looks impressive and dangerous.</li><li>Nice separate tilt-rotor craft. This would already be worth a separate set.</li><li>The speed-boats are bulked up to look more than just a life-raft</li><li>Brick-removal tool. The addition of this tool is quite common nowadays in larger sets but they are so useful that it's worth mentioning.</li><li>6 vehicles in one set (2 jetskis, 2 liferafts, 1 boat and 1 tilt-rotor-craft)</li><li>This set keeps the kids playing in the bathtub.</li><li>large single piece hull is a sturdy base so the set does not fall apart easily.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Boat hull is one piece. I understand this was to keep cost down but it just doesn't feel very 'Lego'<br></li><li>Lions very much under-represented in this set. If you have other Chima sets (and you should!) this doesn't matter at all.<br></li><li>This set keeps the kids playing in the bathtub. Seriously. It's hard to get them to get out of the bath.</li><li>There are so many positions and vehicles that the number of minifigures is by no means enough to man (animal?) the whole set. Again, if you own other Chima sets this does not matter as you can move your crew around as you see fit.</li></ul>
<p>I think for adult collectors this set is worth getting for the colours and the minifigures alone. For younger fans this set is great to play with due to all the various vehicles and the way they combine (in the water even!).</p><p>Despite all this, the set doesn't Wow me like some other sets do. It's great and I would personally not skip it but if you only want to buy one set this year I would not recommend this one (see my other reviews), there are just too many fantastic sets out this year. <br></p><p>I would give it 4.5/5 for this reason which rounds up to 5/5.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"TheFadedTBCap","2013-06-25T16:32:50.133Z","Cool Croc Boat","This is a great set with some awesome features and cool minfigures as well as some cool pieces.&nbsp; The boat looks like a croc with snapping jaws and a swiping tail.&nbsp; The base of the boat is all one piece.&nbsp; The boat feature double cockpits, one with a steering wheel and the other with a computer like thing.&nbsp; To the left and right of the cockpits are removable boats which are connect over some claws (which can move, but can not grab very well).&nbsp; The boats are identical to each other having a small detailed motor with a rotating blade and twin guns, which can fold in and out.&nbsp; The snapping jaws open up to reveal a prison that can hold six or so minifigures.&nbsp; At the back of the ship holds a turret that is connected to two big engines and the tail.&nbsp; This part can raise up to become an airplane.&nbsp; This part also has two flick-fire missiles.&nbsp; When the airplane rises up, it reveals a Chi powered engine as well as a weapon storage room with a wrench a two axes.&nbsp; In the middle of the ship is a small empty space for either fighting on the ship's deck, carrying trooops, etc.&nbsp; Also, I hear this ship can float, which is another very cool addition to this set.&nbsp; The two small Lion water speeders are cool and identical to each other.&nbsp; These mini-boats have enough room for a minifigure to sit or stand while holding on to the steering device.&nbsp; The minfigures in this set have amazing detail and have a lots of cool printing.&nbsp; All of these minifigures have double sided heads (showing most of the emotion through their eyes because of the masks) and printing on their backs.&nbsp; This set has minifigures from three tribes (Crocodiles, Lions, and Raven) giving a wide range of different minifigures.&nbsp; Lennox and Leonidas have muscular lion bodies with a blue strap (Lennox has three straps, Leonidas has two) which connect to the Chi holder.&nbsp; The legs are the same having blue and gold detailing with a gold lion head on the knees and belt.&nbsp; Lennox comes with a gold armor piece which is widely used in many Chima sets.&nbsp; The crocodiles in this set include Cragger, Crominus, and Crooler.&nbsp; Cragger's head is dark green with a scar through his left eye.&nbsp; His torso has red rags that form an ""X"" over his chest with a Chi holder at the center.&nbsp; The ""X"" continues on and is printed on his back.&nbsp; His legs (which are the same as Crawley's from other Chima sets) have a rag belt like thing that continues on his legs like shorts.&nbsp; He comes with gold armor and a red beaten up cape. Crominus head has a golden crown on it.&nbsp; His torso is covered with a red sleeveless shirt with a bone necklace connected to his Chi holder.&nbsp; His back continues with the red shirt, but has a cool Crocodile logo on it.&nbsp; His legs are cool with bones strap on to it.&nbsp; Crooler head is dark green with some piercings and purple scales around her eyes.&nbsp; Her torso is decorated with light purple rags and a Chi holder necklace. Her legs have light purple shorts printed on it as well as a red rag belt.&nbsp; Rawzom head is decorated with a cool gold and red designs.&nbsp; The body has a golden raven Chi holder as well as gray lines and dark purple accents as a type of armor.&nbsp; His legs have some gray and purple details as well as golden ravens on his knees.&nbsp; He has the same golden armor with black wings connected to it by to dark gray clips which look good (but would have looked better with black clips).&nbsp; This set also comes with a lot of cool weapons.<br><br>Pros:<br>Cool croc boat<br>Command ship is pretty big<br>Snapping jaws with prison<br>Two removable mini-boats<br>Removable airplane with two movable engines<br>Rotating turret<br>Two flick-fire missiles<br>Swiping tail<br>Two cool lion water speeders<br>Moving claws<br>Cool minifigures<br>Awesome accessories and weapons<br>Comes with some cool new pieces as well as some older bricks in new colors<br><br>Cons:<br>The boat offers a lot of features, but it needs a greater foe to fight<br>Armor really limits arm movement from going backwards<br><br>Overall I give it a 9/10.&nbsp; I recommend this set to Chima collectors and people looking for some cool new pieces for their collection.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
