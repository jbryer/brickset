<p>The box is the standard sizing for the $39.99 pricing for LEGO. The box has great graphics and pictures of the product. The front has a great action shot with the back showing more pictures and features of the set.</p>

<p>The instructions are again standard sizing for a set in this price range. Again exceptional graphics and easy to follow instructions. Again, just great LEGO quality you have come to expect from such items.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 nothing wrong, exactly what I expected it should be, nothing stood out.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>What drew me to the set were the minifigures *more on that next. The set has some great piece. The blue wings and pieces in the set are great to add to any collection. They tracks are also great and can be used in alot of other creations. The launchers are always great and I cannot recollect another set where you get two of them in one set! The pearl gold talons on the front are great pieces as well/</p>

<p>Overall: 4.5/5 great selection of pieces. Overall a good selection.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>One reason I wanted this set is for Wilhurt. He can now be found in the Worriz Combat Lair, but at the time this was the only set with him. Even so, he is a great figure. You also get Equila and Eglor which are found in other sets. So there aren&#39;t any exclusives in this set, but you still get three great minifigures. All of the Chima minifigures are great ones for anyone, child or AFOL.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 great minifigures, just no exclusives/uniques</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>The build is not anything to marvel about. It has some redundancy because of the tracks and wings and such, as expected. I do like the detachable pilot pod that comes off. It is a relatively easy build and one that doesn&#39;t take too long.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 nothing standing out, but still a great build.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>The set is a great one to add to any collection.All Chima sets are exceptional. So there, I haven&#39;t run into a Chima model I wasn&#39;t happy about. This one has great playability. It doesn&#39;t have the greatest poseability since it has only minor moving parts. However it overall looks great, looks like an eagle (which is the goal), and looks great on display.</p>

<p>Overall: 4.5/5 good looking set with great playability.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $39.99. Piece count is 339 with 3 minifigures.</p>

<p>Price-per-Piece: $0.117 per piece. This is over the $0.10 benchmark I usually will hold for many LEGO sets. Has a better P/P ratio since it is a LEGO only product and not licensed. Thus Chima in general is a great theme to collect.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: 3 minifigures (10 pieces each for eagles, and 4 for wolf) (legs, body, head, helmet, chestplate, chi, wings and clips) I count a minifigure at $3.00. Thus total price of the rest of the set alone comes to: $30.99 and 315 pieces. Price-per-Piece: $0.098 which is a great price for pieces.</p>

<p>Overall: 4.5/5 Great set for 3 minifigures and a great model for the price.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>Get his set. It is an exclusive and only available in certain stores. It is worth the price and will look great in any collection.</p>

<p>I recommend the set to any child for playability and great minifigures and to any AFOL for the great minifigures again and the value. I honestly recommend all Chima sets.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Great set, great minifigures in the Chima line.</p>
