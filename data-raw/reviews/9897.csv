 RING OF FIRE!</p>
<p>

<p>
 Intro</p>
<p>
 Hi i&#39;m doing my first Chima review the theme by the makers of Ninjago i mark my reviews just saying any way let&#39;s start this review and i&#39;m starting with the ring of fire.</p>
<p>
 THE RING OF FIRE</p>
<p>
 First we have the ring of fire at first i was confused why do they have a obstacle with a figure then i looked at the back of the box and found what to do you get two more to make a big obstacle course i know quite clever.It&#39;s quite big so you have a ramp to make it cooler and drive on it to jump thourgh on your motorclycle then you get 6 chi&#39;s if you get all the sets you will have about 150 chi&#39;s!Igive this a 8.</p>
<p>
 FIGURE AND MOTORCYCLE!</p>
<p>
 The figure Razar is the head of the tribe he has hook hand and a plain hand to put weapons in after he has a two sided head like all chima figures.Next we have the red motorcycle first you have to build the attachment it goes on the end easy to build the weapon is bassicaly the same one as razcal i give them a 8.</p>
<p>
 OVERALL!</p>
<p>

It is a game to go along with the Legends Of Chima Theme and comes with some good parts. I would reccomed this set to a KFOL for the play-ability, to a TFOL for the&nbsp;play-ability, parts and figure and to an AFOL to play with the kids, parts and figure.</div><div><br></div><div>tmgm528</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2016-06-27T16:54:18.037Z","Dangerous Ring of Fire.","<p><strong>Set # 70100 Ring of Fire: </strong>The raven tribe enter the realm of Speedorz with this impressive looking little set. A solid number who has a lot going for it compared to some of the others.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>They are what they are, honestly what more is there to say that I haven&rsquo;t covered before? Easy to follow steps for building what little there is to build, the steps to play the game the official way and of course the cross-promotional stuff with minifigure checklists. I will say this, I especially like the fact that each speedor instruction manual has the main minifigure&rsquo;s headshot on the front. Seeing the character pictured front and centre is a great artistic choice.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Razar: The leader of the Raven Tribe himself is Razar and his minifigure never disappoints. The printing on him is always super cool, with a double-sided torso, leg printing, a double-sided face and a lot of printing in the front of his headpiece for his steel covered beak and the funky metal mask he&rsquo;s wearing. The level of detail in Chima minifigure prints is something to cherish as I doubt we&rsquo;ll be seeing a Theme like it again, most other Themes rarely feature double-sided facial prints on pretty much their entire collection of minifigures. Even the ones without double-sided faces have some sort of back printing on them. Really impressive.</p>

<p>For his weapons Razar get&rsquo;s the Slizar, basically a LEGO scimitar piece and the brick-built Thundax, a weapon powered by Chi that is a double-bladed axe of some kind. It uses the purple pieces we saw in Razcal&rsquo;s Glider for the axe heads and looks quite menacing.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>Razar&rsquo;s Speedor is decked out in a ton of armour on either side for the print work, and it also features the raven tribe symbol, which is a nice touch. The dark maroon colour of the topper is also interesting as I would have expected the ravens to get black ones honestly. The addition to it is basically just a few pieces to attach some flames out of the back. It&rsquo;s pretty weak as far as add-on play pieces for a speedorz go, not much of an obstacle to the other racers on the track. I mean when you&rsquo;re playing with the toy, it&rsquo;s probably really bad on the show when you&rsquo;re suddenly having to dodge his flaming exhaust.</p>

<p>The Model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>This model doesn&rsquo;t use too many pieces either, much like Target Practice, but it is a much better designed obstacle. You launch your Speedor at a ramp and try to get it through the ring of fire, a large circle of transparent orange clip-together-bricks that really works well as a dangerous ring of fire. The pieces will be useful in other MOC builds too, since it isn&rsquo;t often we see these bricks in this colour. You also wind up putting two fire gouts on the ground in front of it, some radar dishes in transparent red with flames attached, not big or impressive, but suitable enough for the purposes of the game and display.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Razar&rsquo;s character card in this set along with Kleptor S1 the Speedor card, Thundax and Slizar the weapons cards and Blazet for the add-on parts. A shame LEGO isn&rsquo;t including cards anymore as the Speedorz seems to have been largely ignored in 2015 and I doubt we&rsquo;ll be seeing them come back anytime soon. I can&rsquo;t imagine why.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A nice set with some interesting parts and a great minifigure. This is a real keeper and I&rsquo;m glad I managed to pick it up. I definitely recommend it, I like the overall package here and the game does wonders plus it looks great on the shelf as a display piece when not in use. Or the parts can be used for a MOC. Don&rsquo;t miss out. Get yours if you can still find it.</p>
