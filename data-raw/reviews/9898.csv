"ChocolateCrisps","2013-01-05T17:07:31.213Z","Great Gimmick, Dull game","<p>When I first found out about the Speedorz sets, I was intrigued by the new concept. I had enjoyed the Ninjago spinners enough, and was interested in these, particularly the eagles. I saw this set at my local toy shop and bought it. Here are my thoughts.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The front of the box (blister packaging, actually) has a very photoshopped image of the set, and has the Speedor, ripcord and cards visible. The back has an image of two kids playing the game. The instructions have the same image as the front of the box. They also contain the basic game rules, but the rules do not make any reference to weapons and power-ups, which is rather confusing.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts are fairly common, although there is a new clip piece and the Speedor with it's fancy printed cover and shiny metal wheel.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Equila is a brand new minifigure, and is extremely good. He uses several new prints and parts, and his double sided head under the helmet is fun.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There is very little to actually build in the set, and I did not find it very interesting.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is composed of several small builds of varying interest. The Speedor is the best part of the set, and should be sold alone. I spent half an hour messing around with it and generally annoying the rest of my family. It goes very fast and is also quite heavy, however so it does make a rather dangerous projectile.</p><p>The rest of the set, however, is not as good. The missile launcher fails to shoot the targets as the Speedor is so powerful it simply flips the launcher over. Because of this and the fact that the Speedor also tends to miss them, the targets are a little bit pointless. The game I have played with my sister, and it is more fun to race the Speedors than actually play the game, as we soon discovered.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The set is worth the price just for the Speedor and figure, but the rest of the set is not particularly good. Buy it if you are after fun, but don't buy if you are just interested in the game.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2016-06-27T16:40:14.64Z","Equila Practices for CHI Victory.","<p><strong>Set #70101 Target Practice: </strong>Time to review another speedor set and while I do praise some of them others often disappoint. This set is a bit of a mixed bag in that regards, let me elaborate on that with this review.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>The instructions aren&rsquo;t much to discuss since I&rsquo;ve gone over Speedor instructions numerous times by now. That being said they serve their part well by explaining the rules of the game for this particular set, and include simple to follow steps for building what little there actually is to build in here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Equila: Another great Eagle Tribe member who is found in a rare number of sets. This is the cheapest method of acquiring the eagle tribe warrior and he&rsquo;s another great looking minifig. He&rsquo;s got that great super detailed double-sided torso printing and leg printing we&rsquo;ve come to expect for Chima minifigs, with a double-sided face and a printed headpiece showing some of the feather markings on his head and the sweeping wing-ears that are on every Eagle Tribe member.</p>

<p>Sadly his weapons are a bit wanting. You get the standard Jaba (spear) and a axcalion, basically a long handled buildable axe with transparent blue chi blades instead of solid metal like those found in the Castle themes. Not as impressive as some of the other weapons in the line, but hey they can&rsquo;t all be awesome.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>This is one of the more interesting design choices. It&rsquo;s still your basic speedor chariot from the initial offerings, with a nice looking unique print on the eagle topper showing that it belongs to Equila. What&rsquo;s interesting is the add-ons. In this set you actually attach long handled helicopter blades to either side of the speedor as part of the game.</p>

<p>This affords an interesting design choice, not only do they stabilize the speedor when on the shelf for display, but they are a true hazard for other speedors during the races. On top of that Equila could probably get some serious air time with them, with enough speed he could lift off the ground and actually achieve limited flight.</p>

<p>The Model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where we come to the disappointing aspect. Mostly due to the piece count of the set. This game obstacle involves building three little stands with brick-built raven targets. Actual raven animals, the object is to then hit a ramp hard enough to launch a trigger-fire missile at the three targets.</p>

<p>This just seems too complicated for its own good and makes for one of the poorer game ideas for the line. While they make excellent display pieces for a Speedorz track or something, they just don&rsquo;t strike me as being all that fun. I do enjoy the designs of the little brick-built ravens though. It&rsquo;s a nice clever micro-build that I can see being used in any number of MOC displays.</p>

<p>The cards in this set are the Equila character card, Shreekor 360 (Speedorz card), Axcalion and Jaba cards and lastly the Gyroropt. I guess what they&rsquo;re calling the speedor when it has the two blades attached. I like these designs so much better than the ones found in the newer speedorz because they actually have different names and such. Wish they&rsquo;d kept that idea going forward.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a mediocre set in the end run. While I do enjoy the elements presented in it, I&rsquo;m afraid the price-per-piece ratio is just a little on the weak side. On top of that the game aspect of this speeor set is really hit-or-miss, quite literally because timing it just right to hit the ramp attached to the trigger-fired launcher just seems counterintuitive to me.</p>

<p>In this instance I&rsquo;d recommend it more for the display worthiness and the awesome micro-raven builds attached to the targets. It&rsquo;s one speedor you can safely skip.</p>

"EisforElephant","2013-01-20T23:37:52.743Z","Shoot down the ravens!","<p></p><p>Ah yes, Speedorz. When this subtheme was first announced, as a Ninjago fan, I wasn't really interested. Now that I've seen many opinions on them, I decided to pick one up and try them out.&nbsp;Surprisingly, I've found my interest for them.&nbsp;</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The pack has some nice images showing the play feature, and a really great picture of Equila. On the back it shows two kids playing the games. It also advertises some of the other Speedorz sets.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions has the same images of the feature and Equila. Inside the instructions are more advertisements and the tutorial of how to play the Speedorz game.&nbsp;</div><h4>Parts</h4><p>The new parts included are amazing, which include Equila's armor, his Speedorz, his ripcord, and the CHI crystals. Other interesting parts included are the missile launcher, and the printed target piece.</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Equila is a really awesome minifigure. As an eagle, he comes with wings that attach on the back of his golden armor. He has really nice printing on his chest, which shows his muscles and more golden armor. His back includes a bit more printing of his golden armor. His legs are printed with a golden belt, golden leg armor, and his claws. Equila has a double sided face, one side with goggles, the other side without. Finally, his helmet is very interesting, especially the black outlining for his goggles. He also comes with a double sided CHI axe, and a gray spear.</div><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very easy and simple, I had fun building the brick ravens!</p><h4>The completed model</h4><div>The completed model looks very cool. The game is fun too. I really enjoyed it.</div><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This blister pack is at a really good price of $14.99 for everything included. Equila and his Speedorz are very cool, and so are the mini raven targets. The missile launcher included also is a big plus. I hope you enjoyed my first review of Target Practice. Thanks for reading!</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,5
