 To start off this review, I must recommend Furno XL to you. He is quite cool, both in looks and in pieces. He however is slightly lacking in the playability area. He is very good for posing, though, and it is quite easy to make him look epic! His sword is, for me, definitely the main attraction, followed by the cape.</p>
<h4>
 Pros</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  Sword</li>
 <li>
  TriOrange armor pieces</li>
 <li>
  Cape</li>
 <li>
  Shield pieces, easily adapted to many uses</li>
 <li>
  Good building experience with many new techniques I have not seen before in Hero Factory. Believe me, I have a lot of Heroes + Villains and know how they are made!</li>
 <li>
  Most of his pieces would work wonders on Technic constructions</li>
</ul>
<h4>
 Cons</h4>
<ul>
 <li>
  The new heads are completely featureless</li>
 <li>
  When you take the clear headpiece off, his helmet looks horrible underneath</li>
 <li>
  The cape is used only to cover a horribly unarmored and skimpy back</li>
 <li>
  &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
 So, that&#39;s what I think about the set. Go to the store, and pick him up. You won&#39;t regret it!&nbsp;</p>
