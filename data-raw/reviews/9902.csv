<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box isn't a box, it is a foil packet so it saves a lot of space in your box storage if you have one like me. On the front it has a large 'brain' coming down over the top of the packet and ""brain attack"" on the top right which seems to be written in blood (nice chaps these 'brains' eh') and Pyrox is running towards the viewer as if he is about to jump out of the printing and come to life which I personally think is quite cool. There are two 'brains' in the background close to the fire which seems to be coming from Pyrox. On the back it shows that you can combine 44001 and 44000 together to crate some other thing I don't know the name of and a picture showing that you can input a code included in this set onto the website to get 600 game points. The instructions makes it unfortunately very easy for people (come on LEGO, when are going to make a challenge?). &nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There are lots of interesting parts in this set. There are the two fire pieces, the claws, the shoulders, the horns, the mask and of course the 'brain'. The fire can be useful for all sorts of things and the teeth attached here and there can be used as blood coated fangs for monsters in MOC'S.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p><span id=""result_box"" class=""short_text"" lang=""ro""><span class=""hps""></span></span>None! <span id=""result_box"" class=""short_text"" lang=""fr""><span class=""hps"">Aucun! </span></span><span id=""result_box"" class=""short_text"" lang=""la""><span class=""hps"">Neminem! </span></span><span id=""result_box"" class=""short_text"" lang=""ro""><span class=""hps"">Nici unul!</span></span></p>
<h4>The build</h4>Just your boring hero factory build, just snap this bit and that bit and you done! How utterly boring for a EPIC set! One of the most interesting bits is building the fire weapon and even then it's not that fun.<br><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Getting there now! If you survived the B-O-R-I-N-G build you come to a rather nice looking set. A rocky monster made of lava with a 'brain' on the back and massive horns sticking out and magma claws and awesome shoulder things and something that looks like a flame thrower. It's an epic look with epic horns and just plainly epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic (last one!) epic everything! <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, if your looking for an good baddie, then this is the one to choose. Every piece about him is just cool (or should I say burning! Geddit?).<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4

The parts are good for making a MOC</p><p><br></p><p>Playability</p><p>Pyrox first has no problem with moving his legs and arms. He also has a neat weapon that spins. If you have some power functions you can use them to make his weapon spin rapidly. </p><p><br></p><p>Overall it is a good set but feels a bit over priced</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
