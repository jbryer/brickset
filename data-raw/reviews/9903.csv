Eye-catching and overall complementing to the actual set. As this is my first Hero Factory set, I didn't know what to expect as far as the build was concerned. Having built set 42006 (~720 piece technic excavator) only a few days before, the set seemed a little simplistic for building experience, but I suppose it's alright for the age range on the set bag.</p><p>Rocka himself has a nice sword, a working visor, clamps that 'protect' his hero core, and a shield with spinny things on it. All these features go quite well with the set except the shield. It fits nicely on his back (like helicopter blades) so it looks like he could fly, but in his hand it's hard to get the shield in a place where&nbsp;it looks good.&nbsp;And where the blades don't look like they're going to whack off some of Rocka's appendages.</p><p>Well, overall I give this set 4/5 bricks. It's easy and simple, and comes with lots of nice play features. Perfect for the KFOL/Hero Factory fan in your family.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
