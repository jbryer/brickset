"Darthdany","2013-04-10T05:16:55.847Z","A great set, just would've been better if the back arms don't swing around....","<p>Scarox, one of the evil baddies with a Brain. The brain is 12cm long, and feels rubbery. He is a smaller figure compared to the other 3 evil dudes. He has 4 arms, but his back 2 aren't stabilized and will 'swing' when posed far back which is a bit annoying at times, because for Scarox's back arms to stay on top you will have to pose him forward. His 4 arms are shorter than the other mutations too, but makes up in quantity. His mask is dull, and you can't see his 4 red eyes. He also doesn't have any armor except for the bottom of his legs. Also included is a code for points in the online game, but doesn't fit anywhere on him.<br></p>
<h4>Pros<br></h4>
<ul><li>Big brain.<br></li><li>4 arms.<br></li><li>Great colour scheme.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Arms fall back when Scarox is tilted back.<br></li><li>Mask eyes look nothing like packaging and stock photo.<br></li><li>Arms are very short.<br></li></ul>
<p>So in conclusion I wouldn't recommend him as the first Brain Attack figure to get, the other 3 evil figures are better and you should get them first. 6.5/10<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Faefrost","2013-11-10T20:06:29.987Z","Possibly the dullest Brain Attack HF character","<p>As you might guess from the title, this is not my favorite figure of the Brain Attack line. Even by the lower price standards of the HF line, it just feels lacking in something. It's mostly black and grey, with just a handful of gold to accent it. The only splash of color is the brain creature. The pure black unadorned chest just seems barren. It needs something more. It's easy to see the Spider feel they were going for. But the execution is just awful. The weird hinging on the upper arms mean they flop around in an uncontrolled manner. There literally are no play features to the fig beyond let the arms flop around. We won't even get into how awful it looks from behind.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The Gold Spider Face Mask is wonderful and useful. Save it for your next creepy spider temple MOC.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Pretty much everything else about it</li><li>what little color there is clashes horribly. The black and gold just doesn't work. It needs more pops of green.</li><li>No play features</li><li>Arm mechanism is beyond horrble</li><li>No hands, very limited play value</li><li>due to flopping arms fig is very unsteady</li></ul>
<p>If you are looking for a fig to skip, this would be it.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,1
"flarefish","2015-01-30T08:14:43.48Z","Spider brain","<p>This set is one of my favorites from the brain attack series mainly because of his large scary head featuring&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent green fangs and includes a epic brain piece. This set has a machine&nbsp;on the back were if you push a red lever his back arms spring up, although this is cool and a fun suprise attack it does have its cons like BEING TERRIBLE FOR STOP MOTION or not easly&nbsp;possable. his legs are very basic and are bare at the top, this set is small, and it also has one piece arms ending in some pretty cool hands, claw, things. So if you like gears and machines on sets buy this one, even if you dont you can always scrap it for moc bits because this thing has tons.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Cool machine</p>

<p>epic face</p>

<p>BRAIN</p>

<p>arms are cool</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>machine is rubbish for stop motion</p>

<p>small</p>

<p>not a lot of decoration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My rateing out of ten is 7</p>
