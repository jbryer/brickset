(Except the one from Bulk &amp; Vapour)&nbsp;</div><div>So I had high hopes for the next one, and I can say that though it`s not perfect, its still pretty good.</div><div><br></div><div>I think the 50 pcs are worth the &nbsp;$11.99, but I had a problem with the set when I opened it.</div><div>One of the leg beam parts on the main body torso were bent upwards,but i put it over a stove and bent the plastic back in place,and besides that there were no problems.So when I built him he looked great,the shield and drill are good looking though the little missle on the side of the drill was unnecassary.(Though I think lego puts them in ALOT of sets that don`t need them)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The expression on bulk`s face makes him look tough and the visor goes well with the color scheme which is grey,silver,orange,and gunmetal.The functions are the visor going up and down, the clamp-things that protect the hero core move, the drill spins, and theres the before mentioned missle on the side of the drill. So overall though he has his problems, I would reccomend either getting him or any of the other hero`s or villans.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is bioniclefan001 signing off. Though I wonder if that Jet Rocka set for the summer will fit Bulk and the other heroes, though of course Furno Xl won`t fit.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"BulkFan98","2013-05-25T22:38:03.383Z","Not Bulk's Best","So Bulk's back after his freakin' awesome Breakout set, with this so-so set.<br>On to the pros and cons!<br><br>Pros:<br>It's Bulk.<br>Color scheme is pretty good.<br>If you put the shield on the back, it covers the back pretty good.<br>At 50 pieces, it's the second-biggest hero thus far (The biggest? Furno XL).<br><br>Cons:<br>Most of those 50 pieces go into making his drill.<br>Why a drill? It's an invasion of BRAINS. ""Hey guys, let's drill 'em to death"". -.-<br>Not a huge fan of the orange hands.<br>The armor is way too light! <br>He has a very odd expression. It looks like ""Huh?"" or ""Waa? Granted, I would go ""Waa?"" if I was given a drill against brains.<br><br>All in all, it's an OK set. If I were you, I would get the set, then add some 2012 Bulk shins and a piece of wide gunmetal grey armor.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
