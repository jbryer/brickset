Her weapons are cool, with a long blade thingy and a saw/shield. Her shield can also detach and attach to her back, which has enough space to rotate freely. Her visor can also lift from her mask and included is a code piece which attaches to her body armor plate.<br></p>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>In conclusion I think this is a good Brain Attack starter set. 8/10.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
