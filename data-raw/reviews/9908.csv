From my experience, Bio-MOCing supplemented with the new Hero Factory pieces has some great results, but sometimes it's frustrating when the Hero Factory sets don't have the colors you need. Ogrum has a lot with dark green and brown pieces (pretty obvious from the picture). Enough to be interesting, but not enough to be really useful, in my opinion. If the trans-neon-green armor pieces were replaced with dark green or brown, then I would like it much better.<br>The brain piece may look cool, but it's quite large and pretty much useless for MOCing. <br><h4>Build</h4><p>The build is fairly stereotypical of the new Hero Factory builds. Not much going on.<br></p><h4>Final Product</h4><p>The final set is rather cartoonish and has no real play features. I've found that LEGO maces are often not much fun to play with, and this set includes no launchers and no play features other than the pose-ability. <br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Definitely a below-average set. The parts are useful, but fairly standard for Hero Factory sets. It lacks play features and building interest. I'd say you'd be better spending your money on different set, unless you really need the dark green or brown pieces.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3
