<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The motorcycle looks good</li><li>The fireman is very detailed</li><li>The recycling bin is on fire which is a pretty good idea</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The cost per piece is 17 cents. It should be about 8-11</li></ul>
<p>So everything about this set is good except for the price. Thanks for reading my review.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"McJoJo_McBob","2012-12-12T21:39:37.04Z","60000-Fire Motorcycle","<p>My newest set, the Fire Motorcycle, is a very cool set. When I first saw
 this set in the list of City 2013 sets, I thought to myself ""<i>Oh my god, I HAVE to get this</i> <i>set</i>!""
 I am also trying a new reviewing style(for me anyways, it's my first 
time using the pros/cons template that will come in the end)</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The first thing you will see on the box is <i>LEGO City's</i> awesome ability to Photoshop a beautiful cityscape background and a little sidewalk that the firefighter is walking on, also a bush that is behind him and on the side of his motorcycle, parked next to the partially-hidden sidewalk mentioned earlier. The left side has white writing under the LEGO logo inside the blue border explaining the usual: age range, set number, set name (and just for American and Canadian boxes) the piece count and ""Building Toy"" in several languages.I forgot to note earlier, the firefighter looks like he is walking toward the back of the recycling bin while looking straight at the flames. Covering some of the background is the City logo with the usual effect that the&nbsp; 'i' is a radio tower. The top shows the ""actual size"" minifigure inset, the blue border continued along with the Photoshopped background, burning recycling bin, the set number(again and is on every side of the box), and the LEGO City logo.</p><p>The back of the box has the firefighter putting out the fire using his yellow fire extinguisher and then driving away on his very handy fire motorcycle with the bin closed and no sign of fire or that a fire extinguisher was used to put it out. <i>How does he do it?</i><br></p><p> The instructions are easy to understand and in total have 17 steps, and an advertisement for each of the following: 2013 fire sets, police sets, and expanding great vehicles. Sadly, Gagne kid lives on: the new back was so far used on only the Horizon Express instruction book.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set includes 5 green 1x4 bricks, 3 green 1x2 bricks, 2 green 1x3 slope pieces,a green panel, a red motorcycle piece, and 2 flames: 1 big &amp; 1 small. This is really all I can come up with for useful pieces.</p><h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The only minifigure in the set is the <b>Firefighter.</b>The firefighter's printing is all new. From bottom to top: very detailed leg printing with pockets and reflective stripes on black legs. No hip printing, sadly(plain black hips). His torso has a fluorescent orange vest that has wrinkles to give off a baggy look, Velcro strips to keep both sides of the vest together(duh), two pockets, and a neon green stripe over his regular firefighter clothes. Over that, there is a rope with his transponder attached. The back of the torso continues with the vest, wrinkles on the vest, the rope to hold the transponder, and there is a break in the green line where LEGO City Fire logo is(same one as on the front of the motorcycle, but in neon green). The face resembles this face used since the beginning of city:http://www.brickset.com/search/?part=4261572(I can't create a link put in the a word, I have to do the URL). He does have a broad smile, and the beard stubble, along with puzzled-looking eyebrows. He has a plain white helmet with a trans-black visor.</p><h4>The Build</h4><p>The build should not take long for anyone, any age. As explained earlier, there is a total of 17 steps(including the first page with sorting information), so the build really isn't that hard to figure out. Some people(like me) could build this set without even opening the instructions book. This set does make a good first set because the build is short, but like all the sets this size, there is no ""Modular Build, Easy Start.""</p><h4>The Completed Model</h4><p>The recycling bin can be closed by taking the flames out and turning the lid shut. This does have an over hang on the lid though, so an angled picture disables you from seeing the recycling sign. The bin is also 1 brick shorter than the minifigure. If you take out the pieces from inside the bin it will enable you to put the minifigure inside. The motorcycle has little kickstands on the bottom to support it when your firefighter is out fighting the flames. It has an antenna with a yellow base on the back in front of the blue light on the back. The front has a yellow light, and two more blue lights. <br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is a good stocking stuffer or Chanukah gift, especially with it being the holiday season right now. It would also make a very good set for a special occasion, a first LEGO set, or a birthday. This would also make a good set to put next to the new fire station (when it comes out). It is overall worth every penny, even if you get it from Toys ""R"" Us for an extra dollar like me. Now for pros/cons below:<br></p><h4>Pros<br></h4><ul><li>Makes a good set for the beginning or soon to be LEGO fan<br></li><li>Has a lot of playability: Firefighter putting out the fire, firefighter jumping in the fire, firefighter driving his motorcycle through the bin, lots of ideas to come to 6-years-olds imaginations</li><li>The small amount of money makes a good set for when kids get all A's on their report cards<br></li></ul><h4>

Cons</h4><ul><li>I would write something down for this area if I had an idea for a con<br></li></ul>

"Jakelegofilms","2013-01-03T10:53:34.22Z","One of the best 2013 Sets!","<p>So this is my review on the new 60000 fire motorcycle, it's a really cool small set, so here are the pros:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great minifg</li><li>New face</li><li>great motorcycle</li><li>Recycle bin</li><li>Fire bricks</li><li>Low price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><div>In the old police motorcycle set, there was 2 printed police tiles on the side, they could of had 2 fire tiles in this.</div>
<p>Overall, this is a great little set, I recommend it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"Ernst","2013-01-07T12:33:48.777Z","Lego City's first Fire Motorcycle, good but not excellent.","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong> : The first motorcycle in the City Fire theme so this is a nice addition for the City layout and a good set for kids because of the price and playing options. My only comment on this set and the reason why I didn&#39;t give 5 bricks is the motorcycle itself. Why not the offroad motorcycle as it was used in the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">Bank &amp; Money Transfer</a> ? It would have been simply more realistic and functional&nbsp;than this red Police motorcycle.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> : Not a great &quot;building&quot; set of course, the assembling of the minifigure and the motorcycle and the building of the recycling bin. Three bricks is more than sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 3 bricks</strong> : Nothing really spectacular, a nice new fireman with new torso and several &nbsp;usefull parts used with the bin. A good remark for the big fire part.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : The set offers good&nbsp;playability for the younger Lego fan, both standing alone and added to other City sets. Simply very good.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : We got it in the ToysXL store for &euro; 6.00 which is a normal price for a small set, so 4 bricks here.</p>

"LegoManiac98","2012-12-30T10:31:51.63Z","Recycling Bin Burnout","<p>This set was given to me for the Holidays and I think its a nice little set for anyone who likes the LEGO city series.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The motorcycle is well built and looks great</li><li>The&nbsp;firefighter has a new outfit/look then the old ones </li><li>the recycling bin looks great as well with really well done fire pieces</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers</li></ul>
<p>I think this is a great set and is&nbsp;a great little addition if you making a LEGO city or town. its got an alright price at $6.99 US Dollars and the pieces are nice. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants or is suspicious about getting it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
