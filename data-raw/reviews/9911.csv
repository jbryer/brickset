"Alpha_Tango","2012-12-26T11:56:43.093Z","Excellent ","<p>The new 2013 City Fire Truck is an excellent replacement for the 2005 7239 Fire Truck.&nbsp; I acquired the set and immediately put it together.&nbsp; The set is split into two bags.&nbsp; The first has the firefighters, the hydrant, and the base of the truck.&nbsp; The build is easy, yet includes a number of rarer pieces that are intelligently used to enhance the overall stability of the apparatus. The aerial ladder is excellent, using the new ladder bed pieces.&nbsp; The first, and most visible is the ladder with the railed side.&nbsp; Below it is a grey piece that holds the railed ladder segment snug.&nbsp; Below the ladder turntable is a reel of hose.&nbsp; In the middle is a compartment that holds the equipment.</p>
<p>The cab of the truck is built to carry both firefighters which is a nice touch.&nbsp; The days of riding tailboard are over.&nbsp; Equipment wise, the truck has everything it needs, from an ax, fire extinguisher, hydrant wrench, breathing apparatus, and circular saw.&nbsp; This allows it to respond to structure fires as well as some other incidents.&nbsp; The more you can use it for, the better.&nbsp; Once you put the ladder up, you can rescue people from the second story or get above the fire and put it out.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New minifig firefighters 
<li>New ladder piece with ladder holder 
<li>Playability</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A little short in length 
<li>Pump Panel is stickered 
<li>The box displays a firefighter riding along the side 
<li>Ladder doesn't traverse 360 degrees</li></ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Overall, a good set for the money.&nbsp; It hits the price point, has some new translucent blue round tiles, new firefighters, and the new ladder piecess.&nbsp; I would have liked it to be a little longer in body length, but I think the ladder length is the limiting factor there.&nbsp; I highly recommend it for any fire fans, or a city in need of fire protection.&nbsp; This truck does it all.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Legoman1987","2013-01-24T11:02:17.447Z","Great Price Per Piece Ratio!","<p>This set is great for the money at 9.52c per Piece. Also when I opened the box the bags were stuck inside, because it was so full!&nbsp;Usually&nbsp;they just slide right out. This is also the best Fire Truck LEGO has ever made.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good PPP Ratio</li><li>Good minifigs and pieces</li><li>Good, sturdy build</li><li>Lots of extra pieces, including a hose</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Ummm.....</li><li>Not much here.</li></ul>
<p>Good PPP, Good minifigs, good build, I would say GOOD set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Capt_Kyros","2013-06-16T00:04:23.63Z","Fun little fire truck","<div>Greeting lego fans! I'm and AFOL, and this is the first review I have written. I hope you like it.</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigs:</div><div><br></div><div>This set comes with two minifigures both of which are firemen. Their torsos have some nice printing both on the front and the back. One of the firemen has an orange and green striped torso with some pouches and a radio. I assume he is the chief. His head is nicely printed with a brown mustache and beard, and his facial expression seems to be a happy one. He must really enjoy putting out those fires. :) The second fireman has a little more emotion in his face. His smile of self confidence is surrounded by beard stubble and a scar. His torso is black with a single green stripe, a belt, and various equipment. Overall, I believe lego did a very nice job with both these firefighting heroes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Building experience:</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, the building experience was very enjoyable. There weren't any surprise building techniques or anything like that, but it is still a fun build. The build is mostly symmetrical. What you add to one side you often add to the other. None of the build is very difficult but some might find it a little hard to string the fire hose into its plastic gear that it rolls up on. For this reason, two fire hoses are included. There are some stickers, but most are small. Younger builders might want to have an adult help get them on straight. I counted seven stickers in all.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Parts:</div><div><br></div><div>This set has some nice blue transparent pieces for the windshield and windows. The front windshield is a nice big size that allows you to see most of the inside. Specifically, it is 6x1x3. Also there is a light grey 6x6 circle plate that I believe is relatively new; at least I've only seen it in one other set. This would be a useful piece because it fits right inside a circle made by combining 4 of the 4x4 quarter bow bricks. Finally, you get some nice tools to help the firemen with their firefighting needs. There is a walkie talkie, wrench, fire extinguisher, ax, and a circular chainsaw.</div><div><br></div><div>Playability:</div><div><br></div><div>There are some nice playability features in this set. The main one of course is the ladder. I bet it would reach the second floor or so of most lego modular buildings or other city buildings. From the bottom of the fire truck to the top of the ladder is about 10.5 inches when it is all the way extended. When combined with a burning lego building, this would make for some nice play. Also, there is a fire hose that reaches all the way to the top of the ladder so a minifig can stand up top and put out a fire. In the middle compartment, you get a yellow crate with a water nozzle for the fire hose as well as an oxygen tank and mask for a single firefighter. One fireman can use the hose to put out the fire while the other gets suited up and heads into the burning building to save the lego puppy or whatever may live in there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Value for money:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In my opinion, this set is a great value. You get 208 pieces as well as a lot of playability for $20. Some might say that it would have been nice to include a small burning structure of some kind, but then the price would have definitely increased. For me, the set is fine just the way it is.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Completed model:</div><div><br></div><div>In my opinion, this is a fun fire truck that would make a great addition to any lego city. The detailing is quite nice and it has some excellent playability when combined with a burning lego building. :)</div><div><br></div><div>I hope you all enjoyed this review. I hope I explained things clearly and gave some useful information. Thanks for reading and happy building!</div>",TRUE,1,4,4,5,5
"beegeedee","2013-01-25T06:30:15.98Z","Better or worse","<p>The new fire truck is an upgrade to the #7239 fire truck in 2005. Parts wise and price-wise they are about the same with this new truck having 5 less pieces than its 2005 counterpart. Included are 2 minifgures in this set.<br></p><p><b>The box.</b></p><p>The box comes with 2 bags, a single book and loose is the hose with string (and a spare) as well as the sticker sheet. The stickers in this set are mostly on transparent film and there are 8 of them.</p><p><b>The Build</b></p><p>The build is done in 2 main steps. Bag one covers the base of the engine and also a fire hydrant. The hydrant is a slightly different design from what I've seen in other sets and is a mere 6 parts - it's almost a filler. the rest of the bag contains the 2 minifugres and the base of the fire truck and the central part of the truck as well. Unlike a lot of vehicles I've seen, this features 2 seats so both the firemen can sit in the truck at the same time, a definite plus. Also worth noting is the engine base is made from plates as a starting point rather than the car base seen in the older engine.<br></p><p>Bag 2 and the hose is then added to complete the model. This covers the storage compartment on the side, wheels, the cab, a yellow crate and the turntable. I'm not so sure about the turntable and ladder and while the new ladder part is good, I almost prefer the way it works in #7239</p><p>Total build time is about 15 minutes and the end result is quite satisfying.</p><p><b>The Parts</b></p><p>The set contains a few parts that stand out. The first is the yellow crate which is only readily available in 2 other sets. The new ladder piece also appears new this year and is in 2 other sets also. The set also includes 4 of the 1x2 brick with studs on one side. Besides that the 1x1 round trans blue tiles are always welcome. There's also a flexible hose with connectors to enable the engine to connect to the hydrant and a trans-light-blue 'flame' which can be attached to the end of the hose. The set comes with a spare hose on string and the usual small plates and cheeses and a yellow tap as a spare as well - 7 parts in total.<br></p><p><b>Minifigures</b></p><p>Definitely the best part of the set is the 2 new minifigures - the torso prints are different for both minifigs and are printed both front and back - with older fire sets they often only changed the heads and occasionally threw in a silver hat so having different minifigures is quite nice. The new dark red helmets are great.</p><p><b>Playability</b></p><p>On its own it's not very exciting but take a building, tree or something else and you can have fires and the engine could come to the rescue. Nothing much to add here.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It adds to the fire theme quite nicely and fits in with older engines without looking too modern<br></li><li>The new minifigures<br></li><li>The ladder piece is a nice new piece, as well as having a yellow crate<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The reel for the hose is quite stiff and also tricky to put together. Also my first hose had a crack in the nozzle piece once assembled but it may have been me putting it together. It is lucky there's a spare and the cracked one is still usable it should be noted<br></li><li>Lacking an additional play feature such as a burning tree - filling the engine from a hydrant doesn't cut it<br></li></ul>
<p><b>Comparison with the old fire truck</b><br></p><p>How does it compare to #7239? This new fire truck is simply not as good. #7239 has the trailer, small boat and supports for the main truck while the ladder is up. I personally prefer the turntable for the ladder which also has a cherry picker basket and while it doesn't seat both firemen it is a great set. With almost the same amount of parts it seems like a more substantial set and certainly has more playability.<br></p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p><p>This is not a bad set by all means. It's a nice build and has some nice parts but definitely could have been better by including something to add playability. An average set that adds to the fire theme. It's inexpensive and great for a gift and also if you collect minifigures it's a good way to get a couple of the nice new firemen.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"monkyby87","2020-05-14T18:34:46.267Z","Very Modern and Accurate Fire Truck","<p>As a former firefighter myself, I have a special fondness for the Lego Fire sets that are part of the City/Town line.&nbsp; Every few years a handful are produced, all with varying appeal.&nbsp; However, this little fire truck really caught my attention.</p>

<p>Compared to previous entries, this particular set is one of the more accurate fire trucks in terms of design.&nbsp; It looks very much like a modern fire truck/engine that you would see in a modern city.&nbsp; My biggest complaint with the fire sets are that many of the fire apparatus produced were nothing more than some sort of truck cab and a ladder attached to the back.&nbsp; They simply did not resemble many of the modern fire apparatus that you would see.&nbsp;With this set though, it looks like a fire truck from front to back.</p>

<p>A big part of this is the front windshield.&nbsp; The completely vertical windshield is very accurate and really sets the tone for the whole design.&nbsp; Additionally, the side compartments and rear pump controls are great.&nbsp; The ladder on top works well, and it can be removed if so desired as to modify the set into a true fire engine.&nbsp; I feel as though this set has moved away from some of the more fantastical elements that often accompany the fire sets and has instead taken a more realistic approach, designed like a real city fire truck would be.&nbsp;</p>
