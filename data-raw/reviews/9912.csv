"tisi","2013-06-23T14:40:36.973Z","Burning ruined house, fire truck, accessories... do you need anything else for a playable set? ","<p>In these years, TLG started to produce sets with lots of accessories making them more playable. That's a nice example for this tendency. Details below.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is smaller than usual, and square-shaped. On the back, there are several pictures showing the play features of the set. There are two instruction booklets: one for the house and one for the fire truck. (In my opinion, it doesn't make any sense.)<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>We have a big amount (301) of pieces, and lots of extras. Mainly grey and brown bricks and red slopes for the building, and white and red parts for the vehicle, but we can find green, tan, yellow and blue elements as well. As I've mentioned earlier, there are lots of accessories: broom, rubbish bin, street lamp, axe, fire exhauster, breathing apparatus and so on. We have some newer pieces as well, including the new ladder piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We have three minifigs: two firemen and one firewoman in the same outfit. One guy is sweating, the other one has got a scar, but looks the most cheerful of the three. The firewoman is smiling, we can see her teeth. The torsos and the legs are good-looking, thanks to the stripes and the detailed printing. Their dark red helmet goes well with them. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special, luckily there aren't so many stickers. The building starts with the vehicle. This part consists of two parts: firstly we put the vehicle's base together, then the front and the ladder. The second booklet shows the way to build the house. The whole building takes ~30 minutes.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Well, the fire truck looks a bit odd. Like a van with a turntable ladder. But it's detailed, for example, there are some red stripes at the back, blue lights can be seen at many places, and our brave heroes can put all of their accessories on the vehicle. It also includes a retractable hose (luckily, it's already assembled, so I didn't have to twist it on the yellow piece). The blue lights on the top looks a bit weird, but it's not so important. Then comes the abandoned house. I like it, because it is realistic, and the mixture of the different parts and colours is nice. I specially like the planks. The roof features some fire parts: those elements can be turned upside down, so the house will look safe and non-fiery after this method. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I thinks it is a great set by itself, and a more great accessory for any town. I think it's overpriced, but if you a City fan and you find this set underpriced, you really should buy it.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English Grammar! :D<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"Scott1","2016-02-19T00:09:49.913Z","Great set","<p>I got this set for Christmas a while back. This is one of my favorite Fire sets even though the house is taken apart. Now let&#39;s move onto the review!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember too much about the box,&nbsp;but I do remember that&nbsp;the instructions were error-free, like&nbsp;almost all sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The flames can be pretty useful, as well as the boards. The green trash can was pretty uncommon, at least in my collection, at the time</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It comes with three minifigs; two male firefighters and one female. Now, when I was little, all firefighters were all male. They also had the same facial expressions. It&#39;s nice to see some diversity, even though it is common place now. The majority of firefighters in my collection, however,&nbsp;are the older ones from 2006-2010.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember much, other than that it was an easy and pretty standard build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The truck looks pretty good, although the building doesn&#39;t look as good when viewed from behind, as you can see the pins used to hold it together. That is, though, being very picky.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set, but nothing too spectacular. It does what it&#39;s supposed to do, and it does it quite well.</p>
