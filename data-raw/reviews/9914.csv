<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is nothing out of the ordinary, on the front it shows you a image of the finished set, the recommended age-range and that the boats really floats. On the back there's a bunch of pictures showing-off the set in action. There are two instructions, one for each boat.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of good parts in this set. The obvious ones would be the two boat hulls, both float but only the red one has any proper hydrodynamics. But you also get a lot more, notable mentions would be: two steering wheels and chairs, SIX laser pistols, a rubber band, a 4x4 turntable, a BIG fire and two gear-wheels.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get 2 firemen and 2 race drivers for a total of 4 minifigs. The only pieces that repeat them self with the firemen are the legs and life-jacket. The race drivers both have the same pieces as each-other except for the heads.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>To me, this is really the only weak point of the set. It wasn't anything special really, and the instructions were not always that clear (For an adult this is not really a problem, but for a young child it can make the build a lot harder then it has be. Although there is one very good part about this build: it comes in two bags, one for each boat. This lets siblings ""share"" the build (preferably having a younger building the smaller boat.) You could also give the kid each boat at different occasions (as part of a reward system for example.)&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished, The set shows a good amount of detail such as the radar also having a screen on the dash, proper starboard and port lights, both of the outboard engines looking very realistic and the smaller boat having a water-jet.</p><p>The playability is great, it was the only thing my cousin and his friend played with when i was visiting.</p><p>The only real problem i found is the two binoculars in front falling off very easily.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is a great set. by having two boats it also allows you to some pretty great MOCs combining the two. Some may think that the price is a bit steep, but considering that you get two boat hulls, I think that it is very much worth it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
