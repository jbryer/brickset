"legolover2001","2013-03-15T09:55:39.307Z","60006: Police ATV","<p>Well then, I’m back with another review and this time it's 60006: Police ATV. I have to say, for a small set, it's actually quite good with the wheelbarrow, minifigures and quad-bike.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>Let's get started then. The box is actually quite nice for a city. Even though there is not much to show as it is a small set, the box shows the best parts of it by showing the policeman trying to catch the robber who has a wheelbarrow full of diamonds while the robber is waving his crowbar in anger. I don't really know why the scene is set as night, is it because the criminal is trying to hide from citizen eyes? Is it because he is just a night-time thief? who knows. The back of the box has no playability possibility's on it, just choking hazards in foreign languages. The instructions is easy to follow. I have no idea how many pages it has co's I can't be bothered to count it. <br><h4>Parts</h4>You get alot of cool-sorry-awesome parts for a £5 set. My favourite part is probably the wheelbarrow as it is a quite rare piece appearing in a mere 8 sets including this one. There is also three dark blue pieces which are probably used as wheel-guards and not forgetting the crowbar and two blue and two yellow diamonds. <br><h4>Minifigures</h4>Most small sets has just one minifigure but this one surprising has two. The policeman is based on what looks like an American one (When are they gonna get British?!?). He has a black short bill cap, a (Can't deicide whether he's smiling or putting on a ""almost there!"" face so I am going to just say smiling) smiling face with a beard, a pretty darn cool torso with lots and lots of pockets, walkie talkie and even more printing on the back with more pockets, a spanner looking like thing and a badge that says police, jeans like legs some sort of straps everywhere. The robber has a Gray knitted beanie hat, a angry determined head, a classic robber suit in Gray with ropes and a belt at his waist with back printing of keys around rope with some sort of knife, plain black legs and a crowbar to break into houses.&nbsp; <br><h4>The build</h4><p>Quite boring for a nice set. The most interesting bit is when you put on the wheel-guards and that's probably it.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As I have already said, this is a nice set for £4.99 with the cool looking quad bike with the dark blue with the accessory holder on the back with handcuffs and walkie-talkie and the wheelbarrow with diamonds. The quad has lights on the top which looks like some sort of like the same sort that would be on a police car with a bar on the front with another light attached. The wheel barrow is quite good fun when your making a construction scene which wheelbarrows can come in handy. The diamonds are the normal type just in rare colours that's all so there nothing special. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, if you are making a city then this set might come in handy but if you are just getting it for the looks, then don't get your hopes up.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,3

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-12T13:14:56.027Z","Yet another ATV","<p>Lego set #60006 is the perfect addition to any Lego City or person just getting into the Police city line.</p>

<p>This set contains two Minifigures, a wheelbarrow, four gems, and a police ATV.</p>

<p>The Minifigures are a Police man which i believe comes in a bigger set from that year, and a robber who is also in a bigger set form 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wheelbarrow is just like the wheelbarrows we have seen before but is great for the crook to hold his four gems in (two dark blue, two yellow).</p>

<p>The Police ATV is the normal size of Lego ATVs&nbsp;but this time is in police coloring&nbsp;of this line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has a movable head light, and two movable siren lights on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think that this set is super fun and is a must have for any avid Lego city collector.</p>
