"LStyer","2012-12-24T21:25:22.547Z","High Speed Chase (McCain!)","<p><i>60007: High Speed Chase</i> is my first of the 2013 Police sets and the subtheme is off to a solid start, but Police fans should be aware that 2013's sets definitely represent something of a ""reboot"" for the subtheme.&nbsp; The set includes three vehicles, three minifigures and several neat accessories.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This is a midsized set in a midsized box.&nbsp; The box art is definitely attractive, perhaps actually improving a bit on the look of the red sports car that is included.&nbsp; Each of the vehicles and its driver are packaged in separately numbered bags and each is the subject of its own instruction booklet.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>One of the changes in the Police subtheme for 2013 is a shift from <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/browse/colours/?colour=Bright%20Blue"">bright blue</a> as the ""police color"" to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/browse/colours/?colour=Earth%20Blue"">earth blue</a>.&nbsp; As such, you pick up a few basic bricks in that color and the police marking stickers have that color as their background.&nbsp; The set also get a dozen tank tread pieces that serve as a spike puncture roadblock.&nbsp; The SUV windshield is an uncommon element.&nbsp; Another piece that caught my attention was the 1x3 red tile, two of which are included.&nbsp; I don't recall ever seeing a 1x3 tile before.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p><span>[img]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j107/lukestyer/LEGO%20Set%20Pics/06007-06-MinifigsFront.jpg[/img]</span></p><p>[img]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j107/lukestyer/LEGO%20Set%20Pics/06007-07-MinifigsBack.jpg[/img]<br></p><p>The ""star attraction"" in this set is Chase McCain, the unhelmeted police officer pictured above and the main playable character in the upcoming LEGO City Undercover for the Wii U.&nbsp; McCain is otherwise so far available only as a premium to push preorders of his video game, so this is a welcome opportunity for non-gamer fans to get McCain in physical form.&nbsp; McCain is joined by a motorcycle cop and a masked thief who is apparently making off with $300 and a gold bar.&nbsp; Both police officers feature printed leg pieces, and all three minifigures boast back printing.</p><p>Again, the reboot of the Police subtheme is apparent in the police officers' uniforms, which do not match the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cty098"">police minifigures</a> going back at least to 2008's <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7744-1"">7744: Police Headquarters</a>.&nbsp; If you're aiming for a roughly uniform police force, you may not want to mix the two uniforms.&nbsp; On the other hand, the last police uniform was certainly dressier in appearance, so that explanation may get you past the mismatch.&nbsp; Set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661: Bank &amp; Money Transfer</a> included a minifigure in a light blue police uniform shirt, which would mix better with Chase McCain and his colleagues in the revamped subtheme.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>This set offers a fairly positive build experience.&nbsp; Even the motorcycle, usually an unchanging build makes interesting use of a couple angle plates to give the back end of the cycle a little more heft than it might otherwise have had.</p><p>The SUV is where the real fun in this build is to be found.&nbsp; The designer eschewed the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4259901"">large vehicle modified</a> plate in favor of a number of standard plates to build the base of the vehicle:</p><p><span>[img]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j107/lukestyer/LEGO%20Set%20Pics/06007-05-Instructions.jpg[/img]</span><br></p><p>I appreciate the use of more standard parts and may try to duplicate this method in future ""large vehicle MOCs. <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The motorcycle is a solid variation on an old classic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The set uses a <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4541808"">fence piece</a> with decals and a couple round trans-blue 1x1 plates to create a road block, an interesting use of a well-known piece.<br></p><p>The SUV looks wonderful.&nbsp; If I have one nit to pick with that vehicle it is that the tires are too large for the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4259940"">fenders over the wheel wells</a> used.&nbsp; <br></p><p>My only major complaint with this set is with the red sports car.&nbsp; First off, I'm a bit sick of red cars in LEGO sets.&nbsp; I'd love to see more variety in car colors in LEGO City.&nbsp; Second, though, I just don't think the car looks all that good.&nbsp; It's 6 studs wide, and the general design, which would perhaps have looked good at 4 or even 5 studs wide looks somewhat squat&nbsp; at 6.&nbsp; The passenger compartment seems too long and the front end too short. Finally, a sticker goes on the hood and adds very little to the look of the car.&nbsp; While the too-small fender only slightly mars the appearance of the SUV, the completed sports car model has little to recommend it.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>60007: High Speed Chase is a worthy kick-off to the 2013 Police subtheme revamp.&nbsp; Three vehicles, three minifigures and some accessories seem a generous allotment at the $30 price point, and 283 pieces comes awfully close to the the 10 cents per piece that I like to see.&nbsp; Sixteen extra pieces close the gap almost entirely.&nbsp; If you treat the ugly sports car not as a failure of the official design but as an invitation to rebuild into a nicer looking car, there may be no reason at all for a City fan to pass this set by.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Legoman1987","2013-01-24T11:12:20.177Z","Awesome Vehicles, good parts and Minifigs!","<p>Alright, we got a Sports Car, a motorcycle, and an armored truck! whats not to like?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Police look like SWAT, just add some Brickarms and youre good.</li><li>Sturdy vehicles. Awesome ones too.</li><li>Rare pieces.</li><li>Blockade.</li><li>(For whoever has the LEGO City Video Game) On the back there is a code for a minifig and some missions.</li><li>But if you dont have the game its still cool because each set will have a different liscense plate number, AND it is printed on, not a sticker for you sticker-haters.</li><li>New build for the sports car.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The tires on the Sports car could have been flat, but oh well.</li><li>I wish the Police Officer had the helmet like in set #60009</li><li>Bigger molds and bright pieces make the price go up.. but only about 1/2c per piece.</li></ul>
<p>Epic set, comes with rare pieces, big molds, and awesome minifigs. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants an EPIC set, or if you like good cars, and SWAT minifigs. This is pretty much a cheaper set #60009 Helicopter Arrest. :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"alexfig8","2013-06-24T14:15:50.963Z","Police chase!","<p>This is a great set. &nbsp;I really like it, plus the Lego City Undercover tie in is great. &nbsp;Let's get started with the usual pros/cons review.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Cool SUV and awesome sports car</li><li>Chase McCain!!</li><li>The robber looks like the robber disguise in the game</li><li>Cool motorcycle</li><li>Roadblock is cool</li><li>Pretty good parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Another traffic cone might be nice</li><li>Instead of just a motorcycle cop, Frank Honey would've been cool</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I really like this set. &nbsp;The price per piece is just a bit under the ""golden ratio"", which is pretty good. &nbsp;It has some good parts, especially the dark blue on the SUV. &nbsp;I would really love to see more Lego City Undercover tie in sets. &nbsp;Buy this set!!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2013-03-28T20:14:01.85Z","High Speed Chase","I received High Speed Chase as a fourteenth birthday gift and I'm quite fond of this set. We get a sleek cherry colored sports car, a police SUV, and a police motorbike, as well as multiple accessories.<div><br><p>The minifigures are well designed. Chase McCain and the other police officer are identical in clothing, but since it's an awesome police vest and pants, I'm not complaining. The two faces are also nice- I like the biker officer's face quite a bit- but I find that Chase's face would have better matched the character from the game had he had an open smile. Even still, well designed and a good looking minifigure. The robber is a good minifigure, but his pants and cap we've all seen before. His face reminds me of a Zorro type character and I love this guy's shirt design- the rope and belt are a nice touch!</p><p>The vehicles themselves are great looking. The sports car the criminal drives is absolutely gorgeous. I can't blame him for stealing the car, it looks awesome! However, on the underside, random colors can be found that don't match the red and black color scheme, but since they're out of the way it doesn't pose a problem. The police SUV gives off a powerful vibe, that it's fast and heavy. It contains a trunk and unlike the sports car, its license plate is not a sticker. The only random colors it contains are mostly hidden, so roll the car over and it'll still look great. The police motorcycle is nothing special, almost identical to a <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7235-1"">previous model</a>, but it's a welcome addition.</p><p>The build is an enjoyable experience. I enjoyed putting together both automobiles, but it's not a challenging assembly. It took me roughly ten minutes or so to assemble the set, so it's a short, snappy build.</p><p>Some nice parts are found in the set- cheese slopes (we know how those builders love those cheese slopes), a unique windshield piece, new torsos, 3 $100 bills, a gold tile, and a road block. On the topic of the road block, it's mainly there for decoration- I tried rolling the sports car into the road block as fast as I could, but the car kept moving and the roadblock came with it. However, thanks to its design, you can bend the roadblock to a certain shape if you do so desire.</p><p>The set contains a code for the LEGO City Undercover game on Wii U. Entering the code in game unlocks the two vehicles seen here for use within, as well as two special missions; one where the officer chases the sports car, and the other is a view point change in which you take the sports car role. They're both fun missions, but they're rather easy.</p><p>Overall, this is a great set. The two vehicles are sure to be a nice addition to your arsenal of vehicles in your collection, and since both are well made, I'd heavily recommend this set.</p></div>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
