The only problem with the rear compartment is it's about 2 plates too short for the robbers to sit up(easily fixed with a little modding). Also I modded the inside compartment to fit 2 figures in the middle..I will have to take pictures at some point.<br>The helicopter is small but asthetically pleasing and the light gimmick is pretty cool(even for an adult!)<br>The robbers' van reminds me a little of the A-Team van. It's shortish and at 6 studs wide it looks a little bull-dogish. It is of good design and I like the steps on the side in particular. <br>The museum has left me wanting more, it is a great little build but it just isn't big enough(no doubt I will be adding to it later). It features a painting, crystal, blue gem, sword and a gold bowl as its artifacts. The LH side has a vine for the robbers to climb up and opening roof windows for them to break in to. The front door has a gimmick where you can fold down red security laser beams, looks OK.<br><br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Four different sets in one!<br></li><li>6 Minifigures</li><li>Working Spot Light</li><li>Good assortment of pieces</li><li>Asthetically pleasing<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Police Van Rear compartment is too short(easy enough to fix)<br></li><li>Inappropriate piece colours...such as the brown 1 x 2 plate at the front of the Robbers van.</li></ul>
<p>It seems as if Lego is trying to keep one colour per part. This is slightly destroying their asthetics in their sets, the brown plate at the front of the van is one example, another is the white clips on the lights at the front of the museum, I understand that it is cheaper to do this but do they HAVE to? Back when I was getting LEGO as a child in the 80's you would get lots of colours of the same part in a set..but anyway I digress.</p><p>This set is recommended and has been great fun for my daughter too!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"malboroknight","2013-02-07T15:05:51.65Z","Museum Break in Delights","<p>Here we have one of the new police 2013 sets complete with a museum for the bad guys to loot as well!! Buying it on a whim today i wasnt dissapointed and boy you wont be either! There are 6 bags and 4 models to build with and 6 mini figures ( 4 police force and 2 'bad guys' )which took me around an hour to finish. I shall go through each model and let you know what i think&nbsp; of each one.</p><p>Mini figures :- There are&nbsp; fair few in here you get 4 police figures ( a helicopter pilot and 3 SWAT team members) and 2 robbers for your looting disires.</p><p>The helicopter (with working spotlight!):- This was a quick and easy build which by the end felt a little underwhelming the most exciting parts i thought was the new kind of window for the front of the chopper and the spot light which if im honest is suprisingly bright.</p><p>The SWAT Van :- The SWAT van itself follows the tried and tested large people carrier van building pattern nothing unusually complicated or new in the way of build so its perfect for younger builders and those with no patience, the main element is the new darker shade of blue to give the police an edgier look and my main complaint about the van its the lack of space in the holding cell in the back. even say down a lego figure wont be upright in it.<br></p><p>The Getaway Van :- a simple and quick build again nothing very exciting but to contrast the 'high tech' feel of the SWAT van i guess a battered little van would be the best route to go, still a nice edition to the set <br></p><p><br></p><p>The Museum :- When i first saw this set i knew instantly i would love the museum and it didnt dissapoint. Now my lego city has its own museum its a bit on the small side but it has one now. The build was uncomplicated and the end result was really good theres 4 'artifacts' for the robbers to loot. ( a painting, golden sword, golden bowl and a blue gem) The exterior looks amazing its built to look like its made out of sandstone and stone which fits the building really well. Also with the skylights for the robbers to climb through and a clock and even a pair of 'gargoyles' just above the entrance with a little balconey everything looks and dare i say it........perfect<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>6 mini figures <br></li><li>4 seperate builds<br></li><li>the museum is just amazing</li><li>hours of playability</li><li>fits in perfect with a down town area</li><li>PPP isnt too bad at just under 9p per piece</li><li>the museum again!!<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>at Â£49.99 i wouldnt really recommend this as a starter set buy<br></li><li>apart from the spotlight the helicopter is abit meh<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall i really did like this set, even with its minor faults i would recommend buying it, the museum is amazing and would fit perfectly in any downtown area. When i get the robbers hideout ( or make my own ) it will be perfect for playability but until then i guess ill just have to use an empty house for the loot to be stashed into. We dont want it getting into the 'right' hands do we!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Legoninjas","2013-03-09T11:26:48.413Z","Museum Break In","<p>Now, it's kind of hard to talk about this set without first talking about the pre-release announcement.&nbsp; When I heard there would be a Lego City museum, I was hoping for a large builoding and vehicles like the ones that atually came with the set.&nbsp; But were not talking about expectations here, are we?</p>
<p>Let's start with the heciles.&nbsp; We have a small police helicopter with a light brick, as like a searchlight to shine on the museum or anything else.&nbsp; It's very detailed for its size, and it's a nice addition to the set.</p>
<p>The police van, my favorite Lego police vehicle, contains a drivers seat and a passenger seat on the inside, and there are bars that will hold and support a minifigure.&nbsp; There are 6 bars and 2 sets so you can have 8 minifigures on this thing at once, which looks cool if they're all on.</p>
<p>The robber's car is a small car with one seat, it has a cool piece on the front and a storage space for stolen artifacts in the back, so it makes for a good getaway car.</p>
<p>And for the main event: the Museum.&nbsp; The exterior of the building is among their best.&nbsp; It has vines along the side and 2 supporting columns on the front with banners on them, much like a real museum.&nbsp; The detail on the top is great.&nbsp; They used the micorfigures as little statues which would, once again be found on a real museum&nbsp; There are 2 skylights on the ceiling, which can make for an entry or exit.&nbsp; On the interior, there are 5 artifacts.&nbsp; A dish, a crystal, a sword, a diamond, and a painting.&nbsp; There is a laser security system on the inside of the building, which can open and close.&nbsp; It is definitley a beautifully designed building.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you liked 2011's Bank, you're going to like this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<p>Good vehicles</p>
<p>Playability</p>
<p>Great deisgn on museum</p>
<p>CONS:</p>
<p>Museum in kinda small...</p>
<p>This set gets a 4/5</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
