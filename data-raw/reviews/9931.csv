<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Awesome parts especially the windows and the bear. The baseplate&nbsp;is as thick as a regular block, but it must be on the bottom of anything built since there are no connectors under it</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The little bear is cute and easy for small hands to hold.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Can&#39;t build a lot with the limited number of parts in this set, but a great addition with fun parts to an existing collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is toddler Duplo... There is no model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

He can&#39;t connect Duplo to other Duplo yet, but the little windows are fun to open and close and put things inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
