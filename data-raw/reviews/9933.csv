It makes a fantastic base for all kinds of creations. DUPLO baseplates in pastel colors can be expensive and rare these days, so this is a real plus.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Inside are 36 mostly pastel color bricks that can form an unlimited number of creations. The printed blocks add new design features besides the common eye patterns found in many ""animal"" type sets. This adds excitement for builders of all ages. Can't wait to see what the adults do with this on flickr posts because their DUPLO creations are outstanding.</div><div><br></div><div>Oh yeah, forgot to address the toddler market for this set. Yup, there is one! Wee ones, too, deserve bright pastel colors and exciting designs. (They are not dummies in the design department just because they are so little.) This should provide a much more creative and physical challenge than simply parking a toddler on the sofa or floor with games on Mom's smartphone or tablet, neither of which any toddler is going to play with in my house. (And if Junior decides to chew on or throw a toy in the toilet and flush, the loss of a few bricks would be minimal compared to the cost of a new phone or tablet.)</div><div><br></div><div>This is perfect for a travel set because it is easy to carry and should entertain a child for 30 minutes to an hour or more. Any toy that promotes creativity among toddlers is at the top of my list. We always keep some used DUPLO out for visiting children so we adults can have a few minutes to chat; &nbsp;this is a great set for keeping a little visitor busy in your home even if you don't have children.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are looking for a gift for a child below three, this one should fit the bill. Hats off to DUPLO for such a winning product!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
