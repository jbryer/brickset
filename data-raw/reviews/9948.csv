Now I have one and im impressed. I knew 19 inches is big for a storage container, but once it came in, I was blown away. Big shiny blue brick that the top comes off to store...well LEGO bricks. <br></p><p>$41.99 is a hefty price to pay for a storage bin. I was able to get it at $33. For what you pay you get a huge storage bin, looks like your favorite product, great decoration instead of those tupperware containers we use, quality made, and paying for the brand of course. Made by a company called Plast Team in Denmark, made in Poland...not China. Which might add to why its expensive, but it's worth it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Same exact colors that LEGO uses<br></li><li>Made in Poland, not China<br></li><li>HUGE</li><li>Well made, even the bottom looks just like a 2x4 brick<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Expensive and only 3 avaliable colors, unless you want to try eBay and pay alot.<br></li><li>Takes up a lot of room</li><li>Inside where the 3 round rings that are on the bottom, makes a deep crevice on the inside. I wouldn't store really small parts like 1x1 plates. They might get stuck in there.&nbsp; Super glue or some kind of filler would work, but im just nit picking :)<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall it is a fantastic storage brick. $41.99 is a steep price, but it is worth it, especially if you can get it cheaper. Adds a bit of variety other than clear storage containers.<br></p>",TRUE,5,1,1,2,4
