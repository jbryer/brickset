But, if you take one look at it, it's clearly a Formula 1 car! This model will look good on a shelf, just standing, or will look cool on the floor, driving it around. There is even a gear-operated Drag Reduction System just like the real thing from the last couple of years of Formula 1 cars. Or, as I call it, not-DRS, because this totally is <em>not </em>a Formula 1 car!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The build is super fun&nbsp;- not your typical Technic truck chassis. The build involved multiple sub-assemblies that get bolted onto the main structure. Three full booklets of build!</li><li>The four-wheel independent realistic suspension (with inboard shocks on both front and back) is amazing, and much like the real thing</li><li>The model is <strong>huge</strong></li><li>Both hand-of-god (HOG) steering <em>and</em> a steering yoke for the driver</li><li>There's of course a differential connected to the rear wheels and V8 engine (just like the current generation of Formula 1 cars)</li><li>There is a crank knob and a selector switch&nbsp;on the right sidepod of the car&nbsp;to control the not-DRS (Drag Reduction System), which is a movable element on the rear wing. Toggle the selector switch and you can flip up the engine cover.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons - Admittedly getting a <em>bit</em> nitpicky, but good stuff to know...</h4>
<ul><li>There are two sheets of stickers for this model. While some would consider that a Pro, because it is more akin to a real racecar, they're stickers on Lego, so come on!</li><li>The colors themselves are a bit odd (at least without stickers). I plan to replace all the white body parts with red spares and make it look like Rosa Corsa</li><li>The hand-of-god steering is fine, but the steering yoke is mis-aligned. If you build this, make sure you line it up early. I didn't discover this until way too late and it'll take a major rebuild to fix it. The instructions don't warn about this alignment at all.</li><li>And speaking of the instructions, as with the last several years, I have yet to see an instruction manual without at least a few errors (bad rendering, missing parts, moved parts), and this one is no exception. Fortunately, aside from the mis-aligned steering, no major errors.</li><li>In the back of the car you'll see four blue connectors sticking out the back, and then freak out because clearly you built something incorrectly. Nope - you're good. It's to hold the battery pack for adding Power Functions. Very ugly.</li><li>One of the power functions is fairly lame: open the engine cover. Not a very useful feature, I would have preferred just a flip-up door.</li><li>The car's weight balance is a bit off.</li><li>There's no good place to pick up the car with one hand (the center of mass is around the engine cover, but because it's movable, you can't pick the car up from there).</li></ul>
<p>If you're a Formula 1 fan and don't yet have this set, go buy it now! Yeah, like I said, it's not really Formula 1, but this is Lego, and we're all in a pretend world, so go buy it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"ColoradoBricks","2013-04-05T14:15:29.733Z","Not quite as good as the other single seater cars.","<p>Along with my passion to LEGO, I am a big Formula 1 fan, so this set was a no brainer. I own 8458 and 8461 so the&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;is unavoidable.</p><p>This set has a few new pieces and some interesting building technique (like the upside down&nbsp;steering&nbsp;rack), but the complete model fall short of my expectations. The car it self is about 10 studs shorter than the previous formula cars. Its tires do not give a ""racing"" feeling. There are a lot of stickers and it seems it would be hard to have them line up properly across all the&nbsp;panels (I have not applied them).</p><p>The car it self is quite ""bulky"",&nbsp;probably needed&nbsp;to support the function ""gear box"" and to fit the optional medium motor. The support for the battery pack should not have been included for the regular build, it is just odd and&nbsp;unfinished.</p><p>The 3 functions are the steering (hand of god, reflected on the steering wheel it self (nice touch), the open/closing of the engine&nbsp;compartment&nbsp;and the&nbsp;change&nbsp;in the of the rear wing angle. The last 2 are the ones connected to the optional battery back.</p><p>I would only recommend it for a racing and LEGO fan. For LEGO&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;fans, there are much better build at that price point, I enjoyed #9396 much more. That said, if you can get it on sale, it has some nice parts for MOC.</p>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,2
"namiha72","2013-06-16T08:12:37.683Z","Interesting and large F1 car with a few awkward flaws","<p>Despite being an avid follower of various forms of motorsports I'd neglected to pick up some of LEGO's earlier F1 car models. As such, I can't offer a direct comparison. In any case, this non-licensed 'Grand Prix Racer' is an F1 car in all but name, including such details as the V8 engine and rear-wing Drag Reduction System (DRS). I found it to be a very enjoyable if somewhat short build, with both clever, interesting, and a few slightly awkward parts.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The front and rear suspensions are good fun to build, and have illuminated their workings better than textbooks were previously able to. The springs are placed horizontally, and work much better than I expected. <br></li><li>The sidepod/engine cover looks quite convincing and nicely sculpted. The airbox is a bit short, but it works decent enough.</li><li>The stickers are plentiful, which will annoy some, but they look quite good on this model, giving it a proper race car appearance. Since it's not a licensed product, LEGO had to be creative with the colours and livery and I think they did a pretty solid job.</li><li>The engine looks good. It's simplistic, sure, but being able to see the moving parts with the engine cover closed is very nice indeed. The exhaust tubes add to the look (more on that below).</li><li>The steering is quite clever, and allows both the steering wheel and an extra knob on the top of the nose to turn the front wheels.</li><li>The front and rear wings are quite nicely sculpted. F1 wings are famous for being extremely complicated and detailed, and while it was impossible to recreate such detail on this model, these versions do a good job of recreating these crucial parts of the car. I also like the fact that LEGO kept the rear wing quite wide, whereas regulations have imposed oddly shaped and narrow rear wings on today's F1 cars.</li><li>The model is large. Very large. It's roughly 60 centimetres from the rear wing to the tip of the nose, and about 25 centimetres wide. In other words, it's both wider and longer than the 2009 Crane Truck (set 8258) and the 2011 Mercedes-Benz Unimog U400 (set 8110). At about 12 centimetres it's obviously much less tall than these two flagship models are; it's a race car after all.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The power functions are fairly uninspired, and the placement of the batteries awkward. If you have no intentions of attaching a motor, the two mounts on the rear wing can easily be detached, very effectively 'cleaning up' the rear of the car.<br></li><li>The sidepods are slightly on the short side, making the nose quite long by comparison, but nothing too serious.</li><li>The rear pushrods are placed at an angle, so their broad side faces into the driving direction. As a result, their aerodynamic shape is completely negated by their awkward placing.</li><li>The V8 engine comes with only six exhaust tubes in the original design. This is not a big problem, as curiously enough the box includes two extra tubes which can be easily fitted into the construction.</li><li>The construction that allows the rear-wing to move (the DRS) is a bit&nbsp; disappointing. There was probably no other way to do it, given the space limitations on the rear wing, but it's not one of LEGO's cleverest functions.<br></li><li>The cockpit is very open on its sides, as is the nose in front of the front suspension. This contrasts awkwardly with the rear, and gives it a bit of an unfinished appearance.</li><li>The tyres are too narrow and the rims too large. F1 cars are famous for their wide, thick tyres and the tyres included in this set simply don't come close to their real life counterparts. I usually appreciate a minimum of single-purpose parts, but in this case I think an exception would have been justified. Previous LEGO F1 models have much better tyres and rims.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, I think it's fair to say that it's probably not the best F1 car LEGO has ever offered, but it's still a very nice and interesting model in its own right. The Grand Prix Racer is interesting to build, looks quite good on display, and is very decently priced. My personal highlight in this model have to be the suspensions. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
"DanMiles83","2013-05-13T19:28:49.207Z","Good set big size","This is the first BIG lego set I have built in years, I was a huge Lego fan as a child and sort of fell away a bit as the years went by. I got the set for a magnificent price and really couldn't pass it up. The build went smoothly, around 6 hours all up. I didn't have any issues with the steering alignment as I noticed somebody else had mentioned. <br><br>The set is MASSIVE. It doesn't even fit in my book case so its sitting up on top. It looks very imposing and feels reasonably well built. I wouldn't want to use it as a toy though, the weight balance is off and its hard to pickup with one hand. I was amazed at the number of new pieces lego have come out with over the years, half the parts in the set I have never seen before which made the build far more interesting. I wasn't going to fit the stickers but it looked way to plain without them, none of them join any pieces together which was another reason I used them. The HOG steering works well, I did have a bit of a push around on the floor with the car its good that the paddle steering wheel in the cockpit also works. The suspension set up is really well done with the inboard mounted shocks. That is something I haven't personally seen on a Lego set before.<br><br>The only real gripe is the fact that the engine compartment is geared wrong and takes way too long to open, Power Functions would fix that issue but I think the look of the battery back doesn't do any favors for the car, I removed the mounts for it anyways after I built the car, they looked a bit stupid just hanging out the back. <br><br>Building this set has made me want to go buy some more, larger Lego Technic sets and the Wife probably isn't going to like it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"FlagsNZ","2014-05-11T08:19:23.387Z","Opportunity too good to miss","<p>I have seen this set in stores and it is not one that I have considered buying. While it is a big set, I have not been drawn to the F1 racing cars.</p>

<p>While scanning the shelves at a local store, there was this set which had a large tear on the cover of the box which had been taped up. The box seals were intact and it looked as if it had not been opened.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Due to the extensive tear in the box, I was able to use the damage to obtain a large discount. The shop assistant marked it as damaged goods and indicated that I would not be able to return &nbsp;for a refund. Little chance of me returning it!!!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set was complete as new with all parts packs sealed and instructions sealed in a bag.</p>

<p>There are loads of new parts in this set.</p>

<p>I am wanting to create MOCs of an articulated fire truck with an extension ladder and a helicopter with a working cyclic and collective. Lots of parts in this model fit with these two goals.</p>

<p>I will utilise&nbsp;loads of the side panels and suspension arms to build these MOCs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was straight forward to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The built model looks great although there are glaring gaps in the body paneling.</p>

<p>The tyres and wheels look as if they would suit a truck and not a F1 Grand Prix racer.</p>

<p>The low profile wheels from my 8448 super car look better but they do not click into the hubs correctly.</p>

<p>Great score of a really good set at the right price. Lots of parts which I will use in other models.</p>

"AsafLev","2014-07-15T08:15:57.643Z","best race car so far","<p>As an owner of most of the F-1 technic models, I love this one the best. looking at the Silver Champion, the Ferrari and the Grand Prix Racer on the shelve, I must say I enjoy the elegant design of the latest the most.</p>

<p>the colors, red, white and black, are very intelligently interacting. a lot of fun to build, a lot of fun to look at. the wheels are a bit less wide than previous models which makes the steering much better.</p>

<p>I think it will become a great collectors model in the future.</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2015-02-23T01:50:40.68Z","The most playable Technic F1 super-car","<p>The Grand Prix Racer is a worthy entry in the LEGO Technic/Racers line of F1 super cars that update the line with the modern selection of Technic parts, wheel mounts, and other goodies. While the car does not quite have have the ultra-cool looks and tires of its predecessors, it does not look bad either. It more than makes up for it with a solid build, improved playability, and parts selection.</p>

<p>The box looks very nice in par with all current mid-line (non-flagship) technic sets. It is wonderfully packed with parts with very little air space left, which I like very much. The instructions are clear and well packed. So, no real surprises in this department.</p>

<p>I had great time building the model marveling the suspension mechanic and the interesting building techniques employed. The stickers add to the aesthetics of the model, so I recommend applying them. It&#39;s nice that also that the model includes a decent number of gears and linear actuators for developing the functions.</p>

<p>Speaking of functions, this model features a function selector and manual crank - mainly, the hood opens up and the rear spoiler changes the angle of attack. These are fine, but could have been better operated via levers than using a crank. The crank is geared down a bit too much - clearly the intent is for the functions to be operated by a power functions motor, which also feel unnecessary. The biggest improvement of this model&#39;s functions over previous F1 super cars is the addition of &quot;wheel of god&quot; steering, which is very nice in my opinion.</p>

<p>The completed model looks great and the color scheme resembles the ones you&#39;d expect from a real F1 car. Its profile is a bit boxier than say the Williams F1 Racer (8461) and the tires are not as realistic for an F1 car. However, it still looks great. The two weakest parts of the design are the nose which looks a bit oddly shaped and the push rod controlling the rear spoiler, which is not aesthetically pleasing. Other than this, I think the design is very nice.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a great F1 race car that I would recommend. It provides a nice case study of the suspension, construction, and aerodynamics of F1 race cars. The model closely resembles the Silver Champion, Ferrari, and Williams construction. The Grand Prix Racer trades off (only slightly) the looks and more realistic body shape of its parents for improved sturdiness and playability. This tradeoff is quite reasonable and 42000 succeeds in balancing looks with play features. In fact, I like it better than the older F1 cars which were more of display models that you&#39;d never give to the kids to play with due to fragility issues.</p>

"iuliand","2014-12-28T22:09:55.603Z","Interesting suspension but too fragile","<p>This is my first F1 car set so I&#39;m not in the position to compare it with other F1 cars released by Lego.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some great parts in the package, especially the new wheel hubs. Tires are also interesting to have.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building process was quite challenging. It took me about 6 hours. There is some interesting suspension to admire. Unfortunately the suspension on the rear&nbsp;axle is very fragile and it will result in braking the piece #32039&nbsp;Axle Connector with Axle Hole. On my model one broke when the suspension was pressed and the other one is already cracked. I suspect that the springs are too hard and &nbsp;they are forcing the suspension, the weakest link being the above mentioned piece. Maybe replacing the springs with the softer version will work better but I didn&#39;t test&nbsp;this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s huge. Nice looking but with few functions: <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">engine cover rising</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">/lowering, aileron&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">adjustment,&nbsp;</span>HOG steering, independent suspension,&nbsp;fake engine.</p>

<p>It can be fitted with the #8293-1 power functions set but just to motorize the first&nbsp;two functions I mentioned. I don&#39;t think it&nbsp;worth the trouble and money&nbsp;to do that because it will not add much to the playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice display piece but not much to play with. It is too big and stiff&nbsp;to be driven by kids around the room. As I&nbsp;said before, it is a nice parts pack so I would generally recommend getting it if you find the parts tempting or you are an F1 fan.</p>
