So i decided to enter this build trying to forget that i like to build the biggest and strongest.</p>
<p>It is good, its simple and gives you a satisfied feeling when you press down on the top to see it actually springs back up, brilliant... well worth the price in my opinion especially if you find it in a sale like me.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"18000pieces","2013-08-14T00:02:00.097Z","Cute and Rugged!","<p>I've been a big fan of the miniature technic sets for a while; they're easier on my wallet than their big brothers, but the designers still usually manage to pack in at least one neat feature and some interesting build techniques. Does the Mini Off-Roader do the same? Let's find out (spoiler alert; it does).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nice and small, continuing LEGO's trend of reducing cardboard and ink wastage. The bags fill it up nicely, and there are two instruction books fitting snugly inside.</p><p>TWO instruction books, you say? Yes, two. Unlike the past two mini technic sets, which nonsensically packed in no less than three instruction booklets (two for the main model and a larger one for the alternate model - seriously, it made no sense whatsoever), 42001 has only two, and they're rather cleverly laid out, too. <b>Because the alternate build utilizes the same chassis as the main build, the first instruction book is just about that particular chassis, and the second book contains two separate sets of instructions for building the two different bodies</b> you can put on top of the chassis; they are each assembled separately, and then locked in using a long axis with bushings put on either end to secure it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are very nice; the big tires are nobbly and very useful for any other sort of big-wheeled vehicle you might want to build. The rubber bands are also useful. <b>Despite the fact that it's very clearly an orange buggy, there are only 6 (!) orange pieces out of 100</b>, including two adorably tiny new technic panels. There are some relatively new technic parts thrown into the mix, too, like the male 90 degree angle connector. <b>100 parts for $13 really isn't that bad a deal, especially with those tires as part of the mix.</b></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>As a technic set, 42001 of course comes without minifigures, but it was a pleasant surprise for me to find that the main model <b>can in fact seat a minifigure! </b>Just an added bit of playability right there.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Practically over before it's begun. The chassis goes very quick. The four identical wheel subassemblies are simple enough that they don't have a chance to feel repetitive. The body is then a cleverly complex little thing that nevertheless is simple to put together. I will say this for it; <b>it's very satisfying to slide the two halves together</b>&nbsp;and join them with an axle.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As I said in my title, the completed model is both cute and rugged. The suspension has great range and responsiveness, allowing it to drive over most anything with ease and look really cool and realistic while doing it. <b>The opening doors are a really nice touch that give it an added bit of realism</b> and keep it from being just a glorified hot wheels on a Lego chassis; having that little extra feature really gives it that technic feel. It looks great from all angles, and the suspension makes it just really fun to play with.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Ultimately, this may be my favorite yet of the mini technic models. It looks great, it plays well, it's just a solid set all around. The modular build presents intriguing possibilities for other projects built at this scale, with that suspension, and I look forward to exploring them. All in all, a great model.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"killless","2014-07-26T15:10:29.323Z","Great Lego Technic set to start!","<p>This is my first ever Technic set. I am very happy with my purchase!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The first booklet is for the instruction to build the vehicle&#39;s base. The second booklet features the advertised model&#39;s build as well as an alternate model build. I think this is good value for money!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Having handled some technic parts in the regular sets, it was slightly weird&nbsp;experience to see majority technic parts in a set. But I have already expected this since I&#39;m playing with a Technic set now.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not included. But you can seat a Lego minifigure&nbsp;in it!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Overall the build wasn&#39;t too difficult for an adult. It may need some adult assistance for a 7 years old to assemble, so that the moving parts are able to move smoothly. Some parts may require better motoring skills to clip them in.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed build is rather sturdy. It can withstand a few drops without any loose pieces coming apart.</p>

<p>I really like the suspension of the wheels. It can withstand a young kid&#39;s slightly rough play. It springs back right after going through the &quot;rough terrain&quot; of his other toys.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are looking at trying out the Lego Technic series, this will be a good set to start with!</p>
