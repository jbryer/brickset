"S_Tac_Warrior_","2013-02-18T20:34:47.463Z","Finally, something that is not either a car or a truck! ","<p>I just got this set a couple of weeks ago as part of my haul, but I just got around to open this one and build it a few days ago and decided to write a review since no one wrote one yet. Hopefully, it'll all go well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It is something else that does not have four wheels (it does have wheels, I'll go into that later on).</li><li>The color combination of black body and blue seat is very pleasing (to me).</li><li>The design is pretty good for the A model.</li><li>The B model is completely different from the A model.</li><li>There is a neat little function that connects the rear fan to the pistons to a pair of wheels under the body. When you push it around, everything will move without the need to manually spin the rear fan.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers! Lots of them! Without the stickers, both the A and B model will look really bad.&nbsp;</li><li>The B model is a little poorly designed in my opinion, especially the engine part (it's a&nbsp;propeller plane by the way).</li><li>Price can be a little bit cheaper, say about 10 cents a piece of less.&nbsp;</li><li>The tube in the back is one long piece (and not that flexible), so if you want to keep the A model built, it'll be bent and it's difficult to get it back straight.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I must say it's a pretty cool set. Even though it has its flaws, it's very welcoming for me since it's not another car, truck, or farming vehicles. While playability is limited, the design and color scheme is rather good. The B model can use a little modification if it were to look nicer. I would suggest you getting it at the RRP or less (I had to drive about 20 minutes to a Lego Store since my local TRU overcharges it by a lot).&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,3,4

The box says 8-14 but if your child is putting model A together I&#39;d recommend letting an adult take care of step 22 of the building process.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I liked building model A. The finished model has a neat twist on the bottom that makes it possible to &#39;slide&#39; the back of the model over the table, while the front of the model is supported by two wheels that make the propeller and the pistons move.</p>
