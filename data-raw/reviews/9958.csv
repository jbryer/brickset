So much of it moves around, it really is a little marvel.<div><br></div><div>Building it is straightforward - it's a small set after all - and although it does have an impressive array of functions and moving parts, there are naturally compromises due to the small size. But for a model so small to feature all the moving parts of a JCB and steer, as well as remain robust and playable, is truly impressive.</div><div><br></div><div>The steering system deserves special mention - it's articulated in the centre, using a smaller version of the large turntable used in cranes etc. that I haven't seen before and it works very well indeed.</div><div><br></div><div>The buckets, front and rear, raise and lower via worm gear and work fine, if a little jerkily. They tilt as well, using an over-centre action at the front and a nifty set of levers at the rear. The rear one will rotate as well, but only manually. Loads of digging fun to had; it's strong enough to take it, too.</div><div><br></div><div>The B model is good - a surprisingly handsome bulldozer with totally different styling and proportions from the main model. You could probably use this set to build a version of anything yellow you might find on a building site.</div><div><br></div><div>Highly recommended.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"aldredd","2014-06-17T14:18:19.793Z","A great little digger","<p>I got this set within a bundle of other sets. Being &#39;yet another&#39; backhoe, I probably wouldn&#39;t have bought it otherwise, as I prefer to go for the larger sets, but is actually a good little model&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing special about that parts, but you do get the 2 buckets, and 4 rugged tyres. There is also a surprising quantity of gears for a set of this size.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build should take you no more than an hour - 45 mins for most I would expect. It&#39;s pretty straight forward as you would expect for a set of this size. The guide age is 8+, which I think is about right.</p>

<h3>The completed model / Playability</h3>

<p>For a small set, there is a lot of playability in the set. On both buckets, you can raise &amp; lower the arm using the vertical axles you can see, and tip the bucket using the black gears mounted on the arms. Steering is via HOG connected to a small turntable.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I found this a good set for the size &amp; price point, with a good selection of functionalities, and good as a &#39;stock gap&#39; between larger sets.</p>

"T79","2016-09-16T15:41:50.48Z","Not a Technic fan? That shouldn't stop you!","<p>That title is a reference to my own son, who, when confronted with Technic construction in a System set is usually less than thrilled. And my old Technic sets don&#39;t really interest him either, but I had a chance to pick up a used copy of this&nbsp;set&nbsp;for cheap so I thought to give this a try.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The downside of getting it cheap, it came without box or instructions so we had to make do with the online pdf and a printed version. I&#39;m not sure if it is because of that or if the original instructions suffer from the same issue but sometimes distinguishing between black and dark grey was difficult. So in the end it turned out we used a wrong piece somewhere and had to dismantle part of the build again.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Since this was our first recent Technic set it&#39;s also our first &#39;studless&#39; set, so of course it features plenty of beams and, due to the nature of the subject matter, a lot of them are yellow. I&#39;m not up-to-date regarding technic parts so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything special about them but you do get the buckets which do not seem to have been used in a lot of sets. My&nbsp;major point of contention&nbsp;are the wheels which don&#39;t really look suitable for such a vehicle, I would think the tyres should be bigger (or the rims smaller). Also, I think all backhoes I have seen have a different front and rear wheel size&nbsp;although I suppose they can come with four equally big wheels too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>My son (six) actually asked to build this&nbsp;and with just a little help&nbsp;for the trickier parts he was able to complete it in two or three sessions of about half an hour,&nbsp;dismantling the set to correct an error included.&nbsp;Doing it all at once probably would have been too much as it requires more concentration than the smaller System sets he&#39;s used to. He&#39;s actually asked to build it again but that&#39;s when I remembered my biggest gripe (when I was a kid) with Technic: taking it all apart, pin after pin after pin after - so that hasn&#39;t happened yet.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a small Technic set this one packs a lot of playability: the gear on top can be used to steer the vehicle and works smoothly, the buckets can be lowered/raised/tilted, and the one on the rear can be moved from side to side but this is just a manual operation&nbsp;without any gears involved. And contrary to some System sets, this thing is pretty rugged so it can stand up to some rough play and can even be taken outside without fear that some pieces might be lost!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s easily my son&#39;s favourite&nbsp;Technic set (granted, we have only a handful of Technic sets -&nbsp;this one is in the middle regarding piece count -&nbsp;so this might not mean much) but he actually liked to build it while he usually doesn&#39;t care for Technic builds in System sets. And besides that it&#39;s fun to play with too,&nbsp;what can be better than taking&nbsp;it outside and playing with&nbsp;sand?</p>

"iuliand","2014-01-18T17:29:47.27Z","Outstanding set!","<p>This set was a very pleasant surprise.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing really out of the ordinary here, two booklets and two bags. The front shovel and wheels come directly in the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The most notable part is the mini-turntable used for steering.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It didn&#39;t took a lot of time building it. I think it took me about an hour. The build was enjoyable though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Oh! It is a joy! Immediately after finishing the build I spent a few minutes just playing with the steering. It is a fantastic feeling to steer this little toy.</p>

<p>The front shovel does not remain in position because it will fall down easily. I immediately fixed this by replacing a non friction axle-pin with the friction version. I recommend to everyone building this set to do this fix: in the instruction book at page 59 it says to use a non-friction beige axle-pin #4666579 but instead use a friction blue axle-pin #4206482 . It will improve the front shovel playability.</p>

<p>Playability is very good with a lot of functions. Also the build seems quite sturdy. My 6 year old was very happy to take it for a spin and so far it survived with no damage.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Definitely&nbsp;worth buying.</p>
