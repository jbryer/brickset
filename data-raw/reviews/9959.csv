It is mainly possible because I have the Unimog 8110, the Tractor 8284 and the Jet Plane 9394. I was choosing between the Jet Plane and this original set in the store, but I&#39;m glad I picked the plane. It allowed this build with the above sets as well.<br />
<br />
<b>Box/Instructions</b><br />
I have no box, and I used the online instructions. As usual, the online ones are bad. Low resolution with weird un-profiled CMYK colours that make them hard to read. Please Lego, improve this, and make RGB exports.<br />
<br />
<b>Parts</b><br />
If you buy this set for parts, the special ones you get are 2 rectangle frames, 2 flexible coupling frames also used for the Unimog drive train, 2 large teethed steering bars and 4 large wheels. Too bad they come with the grey rims. I had black rims and those look really nice.<br />
<br />
Compared with the cheaper Jet Plane, this box offers 2/3rd the number of parts. The Jet Plane is a much larger, more complex model, with a large set of great red panels and many long lift-arms.<br />
<br />
<b>Aesthetics</b><br />
The Monster truck is a nice looking truck but the colour scheme is uninspiring. The base is too much light grey, black would have been better. Because I recently built the 41999 4x4 Crawler and the construction of the suspension is similar, I tried to turn this one into Mini Me. So I copied the looks of the 41999 in miniature.</p>

<br />
<b>The Build</b><br />
The car offers a nice quick build. Most of the work is spent on the steering mechanism, which is completely symmetrical. The front and rear part are the same and thus built twice.<br />
<br />
<b>The Completed Model</b><br />
The car is very fun to drive around. It has light steering, a very narrow turning circle and great suspension. It is very solid. You can let it drive from your couch, pillows, drop it from the table... it does not bother. Lego should find something to make a neutral preference for the steering. You can&#39;t drive the truck straight. Besides the steering it has no functions.</p>

<p>The suspension is very flexible by default because LEGO includes the grey shock absorbers. We tried the yellow ones to match the look of the 41999, and it makes the driving a little stiffer and more stable. On the other hand, the super-flexible default is also fun if you drive it off a lot of ramps and bumps in the house.</p>

<br />
I used 2 old shock absorbers from my childhood in old grey. Both broke during play. I have the feeling the shock absorbers are too small. The newer ones did hold, but since they receive a lot of friction, I feel they are tortured pretty much. You also need to replace the gear for HOG steering with a 20 tooth one. The 12 tooth one is too small to move the large wheels.</p>

<b>Summary</b><br />
The Monster Truck is a nice car to build from your existing Lego&#39;s, but I felt it is too expensive to buy as a new set. The even cheaper Jet Plane is a much more interesting build, a lot larger, with 4 nice technic functions. If you need a cheap way to get some nice balloon tires and the 8110 Unimog/8466 Off Roader suspension frames, you might like to buy the 42005.</p>

The box looks nice and is on the larger size, but inside there is a fair bit of space meaning that I felt a little cheated when I took out the sealed plastic bags and wheels.<div><br></div><div>The first thing I noticed was the large size of the tyres, but they feel soft and flimsy. I can well see that with a heavy MOC they are likely too to compress quite a bit.</div><div><br></div><div>So with the bits sorted out into my building tray the build began.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros</div><div><br></div><div>Nice coloured bits, the red panels look good and have a slight satin finish to them. The instruction book is large and fairly simple to follow as the build progresses, a second book is included for the alternative model. The flexible joints are large and snap together with a satisfying click, they also give you a few cool parts for later MOCs. Build time is not too long or too complex and the resulting model looks cool. Four wheel steering is fun and the parts used offer an interesting way of changing the plane of movement.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cons</div><div><br></div><div>Sadly the model is not that inspiring after building, it lacks any kind of engine or place to fit an electrical motor for those of us who have that set too. Most of the parts are pins and small bushes so there are not many interesting parts here. The steering seems a little crude and having both ends identical means that there is some repetition. I had a look through the book for the second build and to be honest it is quite dull, a simple car with rear suspension only and the Hand of God steering again.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, this model kit is OK, but the box feels too large leading to disappointment when opened. The build is not that exciting and the final model is pretty basic. None of the wheels drive anything or are even connected to each other. There are not many interesting parts to go into your parts box when the model is dismantled. I am happy to have it, but it feels over priced for what comes in the box.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,2
