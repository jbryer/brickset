"BungJon","2013-01-01T14:33:59.19Z","Great build, parts, and fun play","I picked this set up at a Lego store on Dec. 29. <br><br>The set is constructed very well. It's fun to play and because of 
its solid build, it holds up very well to play. It's also a very nice 
looking set.<br><br>I have been eying this set for a while because of the parts. It comes with the following rare parts:<br><ul><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">2 linear actuators 
(LA), <br></span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">1 mini-LA, <br></span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">4 axle and pin connector perpendicular double 4L, <br></span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">2 axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles,</span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">2 steering CV joints,<br></span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">2 axle 4 with center stop</span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">2 transmission rings<br></span></li></ul><p>And the following new parts:</p><ul><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">4 pin connector perpendicular 2 x 4 bent,</span><br><span class=""BVRRReviewText""></span></li><li><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">4 new claw pieces </span></li></ul>In addition to these numerous rare and new parts, the build process was very enjoyable and included some new techniques (or at least techniques that were new to me). For example, two functions are driven by axles that run through the boom arm: open and close the claw and bend and extend the boom arm. These functions are elegantly geared at the base of the boom arm using CV joints which have so far only appeared in the Unimog (8110) and the Supercar (8070). The claw uses the mini-LA and was also fun to build.<br><br>The set does not include power functions, but includes instructions for adding power functions. The set is already fairly expensive and the price per piece is higher than many other sets (largely due to the numerous rare and new parts), so not including power functions helps keep the price down. This is a good thing, especially if you already own several motors. And although it does not come with power functions, I highly recommend adding power functions as it greatly increases the playability and fun of an already great set.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Numerous new and rare parts</li><li>Excellent playability and great addition to other construction vehicles<br></li><li>Fun build, including some new techniques<br></li><li>Solid construction<br></li><li>Nice looking set</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Expensive at over 11 cents (US) per piece. This is somewhat justifiable because of the new and rare parts, but it's still a drawback.</li><li>In my opinion the set could be slightly improved by covering the exposed gears in the back just behind the excavator arm and driver's cab. This would make it look more realistic. On the other hand, by exposing the gears, kids can see and study how the gears work.&nbsp; <br></li></ul>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

 Build</p>
<p>
 The box is medium sized. The parts count is moderate yet with some good mixture and some special parts. There are no numbered bags though. The instruction (spans over 2 booklets) for each step is very clear - only few parts are added at each step which makes it easier to progress. There are some distinct components like base with tracks, main body, crane boom and jib, claw grab and cabin.</p>
<p>
 Good points</p>
<p>
 &bull;Use of driving rings helps to distribute motion from single source (hand operated cogs unless you fit optional motor) into 3 different targets. One for boom movement, one for jib movement and one for claw grabbers.<br />
 &bull;Very clever use of cogs in compact form.<br />
 &bull;Model looks good once finished.<br />
 &bull;2 big LA and 1 small LA<br />
 &bull;Non inclusion of power function - that is big plus for me and buckles latest trend. If you want you can add motor for which instruction was given.<br />
 &bull;Price is just about right for the functionality and parts<br />
 &bull;Interesting B model (tracked tractor) although I have not made it yet. Unlike many other sets, I am tempted to build the B model.<br />
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Bad points</p>
<p>
 No con as such but just some minor griefs.</p>
<p>
 &bull;The model could have been little bigger. That would have helped to modify easily for MOCs. This model looks similar to 8043 but smaller than 8043.</p>
<p>
 If you already own 8043 then people can skip this one as 8043 is more complex. But otherwise this one is recommended buy. Not too easy not too complex. Functionality is superb with balanced parts count. Lego should release more sets like this.</p>

"Jayneflakes","2013-10-18T19:53:42.383Z","Toys like this are wasted on kids","I last bought Lego aged sixteen when I used to fight for it with my siblings, but back then I was growing up fast and discovered metal music and body piercing, so the Lego got passed to my Brother who swapped it for a computer game.<div><br></div><div>Twenty four years later I bought a lego bike for a laugh and got hooked once again, which led to my browsing the net until I found this one. 42006 to its friends, the graply thing to my partner and monster of terror to my cat!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So out of the box there were some bags of plastic bits, some of which I recognised from my teenage years, but most of them I did not. I was immediately confused by how studless bricks stick together, but soon got the hang of it. Initially I struggled with some of the instructions, finding the right length of beam and then I discovered that some of the smaller parts have numbers molded on to them. Build time was about two hours, some of which was spent flicking back through the booklets to find the one tiny bit I had missed. There are a couple of things that I modified on subsequent builds, but I will leave them for you to work out. The new feature for me was the switchable mechanisms that turn the motion of the winder into the power for the various functions. Turning this manually did after a while start to hurt my fingers and care does need to be taken not to build the gears too tight.</div><div><br></div><div>The addition of the motor kit was fun, but I was left a little underwhelmed once the initial novelty had worn off. This kit needs a motorised base too or maybe a way of making it remote controlled to make it seriously good fun. However I imagine the cost would then be far too big if this was done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The secondary model is aesthetically more pleasing to look at, but less functional. Having the instructions online is something of a pain because finding a place to put the laptop among the pile of lego rubble and still remain in reach is awkward. Also the plow mechanism is a little dull and I have no idea what that is on the front. My advice is use you spare parts in your lego box and make more fun things.</div><div><br></div><div>Over all, this model is fun, as a adult returning to lego, the new power function prop driven actuators are great, the builds are involving and still manage to be simple enough to follow well enough. Playability after was OK, but at forty years old I should probably know better than to harass the cat with this toy, it was fun though.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"iuliand","2014-01-29T13:00:42.843Z","Great for lifting Duplos!","<p>At first, I got this set just because it was a tracked vehicle. This was the feature that sold it to me. This is my&nbsp;first set&nbsp;using the large tracks pieces. That&#39;s why this set was a novelty for me and I found it very enjoyable to build. Also the building of the claw deserves a special mention as it uses a small linear actuator and the build itself is very&nbsp;interesting.</p>

<p>A week after I finished the build I also attached the power functions set and the playability of the set was greatly improved. Without power functions it is quite a pain to turn the knob in order to maneuver this toy. With power functions it is so much easier to play with it. My 6 year old son is having a good time&nbsp;lifting Duplo pieces with it.</p>

<p>I find the claw fitted on this toy more practical to play with&nbsp;than a classic excavator bucket because you can grab things more easily. Though I must mention that he is not able to lift anything heavy. Duplos are just fine for the job... :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Big box, big instructions... :) Actually there are two booklets and the last half of the second one is covering the attachment of power functions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some good parts like linear actuators (two large and a small one), large track pieces (if you are a track fan as I am), universal joints, the claws... there may be others too that I don&#39;t remember right&nbsp;now.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I already said I enjoyed every bit of it. I think that for a technic beginner like me there is a lot to learn from this set. I liked how the&nbsp;moving axles are&nbsp;routed trough the excavator arm using&nbsp;gears and universal joints&nbsp;and the way the function selection gearbox was done. Also they did a very nice job with the claw.</p>

<p>The build took roughly two and a half hours.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think it looks awesome and joined with power functions it&nbsp;is awesome to play too. I really like it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite being criticized by some reviewers&nbsp;for being smaller than the former excavator sets I think this set has it&#39;s strong points and deserves attention, especially if you don&#39;t own any other excavator set. And after all this is not actually an excavator...</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-05-28T08:49:13.063Z","Great Excavator - Great build","<p>I recently placed an order for 4x1 and 2x1 bricks, plates and tiles through Lego Shop <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-A-Brick-ByTheme#shopxlink"">Pick a Brick</a> so that I could build some real world containers for my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10241-1/Maersk-Line-Triple-E"">Maersk Line Triple E container ship</a>.</p>

<p>Orders placed through Lego Shop and shipped to New Zealand incur $70 shipping unless the value is over $300. Since the Pick a Brick order came to $216, it made sense to order some additional sets to increase the value rather than pay the $70 shipping.</p>

<p>I have seen the 42006 Excavator in shops and so this set was included in my order. It had been on my wish list.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is mid-size for a Technic set. The parts come in un-numbered sealed bags. There are two instruction books which are in a plastic bag along with a cardboard liner and a sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I have wanted a tracked vehicle for some time and this model is great.</p>

<p>There are a few special Technic parts. In particular:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It has two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4638507"">large linear actuators</a>,</li>
	<li>one <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4612100"">small LA</a>,</li>
	<li>New <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6022769"">excavator&nbsp;grabs</a>,</li>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4610374"">CV joints</a>, and</li>
	<li>the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4566742"">tracks</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>There are some talented designers at Lego. In particular, I am impressed by the way in which the excavator arm has been built which includes the controls for the three actuators.</p>

<p>The four way grab has been very cleverly built. I am planning on building a MOC helicopter and will be studying this design in an attempt to build a functional <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_flight_controls"">cyclic control</a>.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I seem to have a collection of yellow and black Techinc construction&nbsp;sets. This model sits well with my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/Mobile-Crane-MK-II"">42009 Mobile Crane Mk II</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8292-1/Cherry-Picker"">8292 Cherry Picker</a>. They are all at a similar scale and look good together.</p>

<p>The excavator drives well on the tracks and can handle household&nbsp;contours.</p>

<p>The gear box is exposed and looks a little vulnerable. It does allow you to see how the gearing works though.</p>

<p>The set could use the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8883-1/M-Motor"">M Motor</a> found in set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8293-1/Motor-Set"">8293</a>. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88003-1/L-Motor"">L Motor</a>&nbsp;fits into the space as well. Neither of these motors are included in this set. The battery pack can be slung under the track chassis with space set aside in a cavity in the excavator body for the motor.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a mid size Technic set which is easy to build and contains&nbsp;some rare parts. It is good value for money and will compliment your Technic parts inventory.</p>

<h3>PS: Lego Shop</h3>

<p>As for the free shipping. On both occasions where I have ordered through the Lego Shop online, I have ordered additional sets to boost the order value above $300. In the first instance I ordered the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/850426-1/Pencil-Holder"">Pencil Holder</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/850425-1/Desk-Business-Card-Holder"">Desk Business Card Holder</a> sets to boost the value of the Maersk Triple E ship, and in this order of $216 of Pick a Bricks I selected this excavator. The odd thing is that in both instances the extra sets were shipped first and arrived before the real reason for placing the order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shipping was still free but it defeats the purpose of having a higher value order to offset shipping costs to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes"">antipodes</a>&nbsp;if Lego Shop splits the order and ships twice. This is Lego&#39;s cost.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not complaining. I have some great sets because of this.</p>

</ul>

<p>(This is my second review on excavators from the list.)</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><!--EndFragment-->Besides the mobile crane 42009 the only 2013 technic set that caught my attention. I would guess that the designers went for grabbing thing so this would not be - yet - another excavator. This set comes with two big and one small linear actuator.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>The built model is bigger than 8294 and of comparable size to 42053 model.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many parts in the tracked undercarriage, it therefore looks &quot;empty&quot;. Due to the big sprocket wheels, the model runs fairly smooth, e.g. with little friction. The superstructure is attached by means of four friction pins. It can be mounted right away on the base of the Volvo excavator 42053.</p>

<p>Drivers cabin has nice appearance without using too many parts. Similar to 8294 the rest of the superstructure has been designed to accommodate power functions motor. The gear box is stretched out using only about 25..30 % of the available space. On the left and right side a few panel are used but none on the back. This, together with view from the top has an unfinished appearance.</p>

<p>Arm - to me this seems to be constructed in a weird mixtures of various beams. I wonder if the designers tried to avoid to copy from 8043? This model certainly is different. However, it shows very well the transmission towards the three actuators. This is a big plus in this set.</p>

<p><!--StartFragment-->The model has only few stickers that do not add much to the overall look.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->All three linear actuators are controlled from the back of the superstructure.<!--EndFragment--> Either height or bending of the arm can be done at a time. Operation of the claw can be engaged separately.&nbsp; The manual operation of actuators is tedious (even more as with 8294) as designers set up a 12-tooth gear. Why not use a crank lever like <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4563044"">this one</a> instead?<br />
To reverse (any) function the cogwheel as to be turned the other way.</p>

<p>Besides that, superstructure can be rotated freely on the turntable and the model can be pushed on its tracks.</p>

<h3><!--EndFragment-->Comparison</h3>

<p>I like best that transmission of rotation is clear visible in this model. Nothing is hidden beneath panels as in newer sets.</p>

<p>Option to add power functions motor is given. Also, there is plenty of space in the superstructure for modifications. Why not try to fit in a bigger gearbox that allows to change direction of rotation (as in 42042)?</p>

<h3>Excavator</h3>

<p>Over time a couple of modifications have become available on Rebrickable: If you would like to transform this machine into a proper excavator, check out the <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/sets/42006-1/excavator/#alt_builds"">MOC-section</a>.</p>

"aldredd","2015-01-16T10:29:46.617Z","Another tracked 'excavator', but fun to build.","<p>When this set was released, I certainly didn&#39;t feel like a tracked excavator was quite due, but it&#39;s actually four years since the impressive #8043 Motorized Excavator (2010) and even longer since the smaller (and more similarly sized to this) #8294 Excavator.</p>

<p>But, it does at least take a different take on the set, with the grabber scoop rather than traditional bucket, which in as interesting module to build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Love them or hate them, LA&#39;s are certainly here to stay (mostly love them, myself), and this set provides 2 large and 1 small LA&#39;s. You also get those grabber claws, which only exist in one other set, and a good array of gearing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As anyone who&#39;s built a tracked vehicle will know, the build can be a little repetitive, particularly&nbsp;when building the undercarriage. Beyond that, it&#39;s not too dissimilar to building #8294 - both are of a similar size, (heck their part count is identical!) an both have a main arm controlled by two LA&#39;s.</p>

<p>The grabber part I found to be an interesting section - both from the &#39;build&#39; and from the &#39;how does it work&#39; parts. Further, because the grabber function is controlled by the main gear box, the transmission for it travels up the main arm, adding a level of detail and complexity&nbsp;above what we got in #8294.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set is a fun build. It&#39;s not going to challenge anyone familiar with technics, bu a good &#39;intro&#39; build. If you have to be quite selective in your set choices, and already have 8294, you may feel a little let down - but it&#39;s still a good looking set, and good fun to play with.</p>
