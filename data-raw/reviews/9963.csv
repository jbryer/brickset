"Kage28","2013-04-19T00:02:46.72Z","A US$19.90 set with 3 exclusive minifigs","<p>This set is part of the end 2012/early 2013 wave of sets, and this is one of the 2 sets from the superheroes line featuring DC characters. However, many have anticipating this set since pictures have been released/ leaked online in 2012 .</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>People don't really buy LEGO for the box and instructions, so I wont say too much about this, except for the fact that the box art is attractive and showcases the contents of the set very well. I have a minor nitpick though: Arctic batman in the boxart is more ""white"" and the actual minifig's prints are more ""grey"". &nbsp;This is possibly due to lighting (or fact that CG modelling is used), but I would have preferred more consistency between the box art and the actual figure</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I am no expert on parts, but the ice block parts should be pretty popular among MOCers. For starters, Marvel fans can substitute Aquaman with Captain America instead to re-create scenes featuring Cap A's history in the ice.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>3 exclusive (so far) minifigures in total: Arctic Batman, Mr Freeze and Aquaman</p><p>Mr Freeze: Exclusive to this set: Uses the tanks and helmet combo from the Atlantis minifigs to great effect. based on his appearance from Batman: Arkham City</p><p>Arctic Batman: Exclusive to this set: New printing and new colored cowl and cape. This is pretty much the minifig (besides Mr Freeze) that makes it a must get for LEGO Batman fans. I personally love the colors, but though there could be more white than grey on the printed areas of the minifig.</p><p>Aquaman: Exclusive to this set. Probably not the most well known or popular DC character, but I'm sure fans of Aquaman are glad that he is included. he pretty much plays the ""Damsel in Distress"" as far as the set is concerned. A good representation of the character's look from the comics, though the choice of hair piece can be better.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>My impatient 7 year old nephew built it easily with little supervision and guidance, though I insisted on putting on the stickers myself to make sure the stickers are properly placed. He immensely enjoyed the build which is definitely not too difficult nor repetitive for him.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The Batboat looks really good, even though casual fans might mistake it as a bat ski or something like that. Looks pretty spot on compared to the version found in the game LEGO Batman 2.</p><p>It somewhat maintains the look of a bat&nbsp;silhouette of a bat and is consistent with the looks of the current line of Bat Vehicles and will look good when displayed with them, especially the Batmobile and Batwing in the Batcave.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I have personally preferred the Batman sets over Marvel sets (and also the upcoming Superman sets), simply because the rest of the superheroes are mainly about the characters (minifigs) and everything else is pretty much cobbled together hastily (IMO).&nbsp;</p><p>With the majority of Batman sets however, besides the characters and/or minifigs, the vehicles also play a very big part as far as the desirability of a set is concerned. Put it this way: If this set came with another version of Batman that has already been released, sure, it might hurt the desirability somewhat, but people would still buy the set for the sake of completing the series of bat vehicles.</p><p>All in all, This is a great set with great minifigs and a nice vehicle. LEGO batman fans should not hesitate to get this to complete the Batman series of minifigs and also Batman's series of vehicles. Anyone else should also enjoy this set greatly.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sf1378","2013-10-21T08:30:36.913Z","GET THIS SET IF YOU CAN! ","<p>I bought this set yesterday afternoon, (Sunday 20th Oct) along with the new Corporate Alliance Tank Droid set. Having bought the Lex Luthor Power Armour set recently I wanted a Batman mini figure and this was the only lesser value set with one; true, he's 'Arctic Batman' but having built it last night I am very pleased with the purchase and what you receive for £19.99.</p>
<p>Actually, its a refreshing change to have a Batman and vehicle that isn't the usual black or blue&nbsp;with grey suited figure and Batmobile of some sort...</p>
<p>Overall, others have given strong reviews so I can't repeat whats been said before but I will say its all highly playable and has a great missle launching feature as well as the ice trap for Aquaman. I also like the fact you can store either the TWO Batarangs on the side strut clips or use one for a Batarang and the other for Aquaman's&nbsp; Trident as Batman races to the rescue! </p>
<p>I really like the Batski Boat&nbsp; / Bat Ice Blade Cruiser.</p>
<p>100% recommend buying this set either as an AFOL'er or as a parent for a child.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-11T11:29:52.107Z","Freeze, Aquaman and Batman","<p><strong>Set #76000 Arctic&nbsp;Batman vs. Mr. Freeze: Aquaman on Ice: </strong>It's high time I got started on reviewing the thrilling sets from Super Heroes 2013, I of course have reviewed a good chunk of the 2012 sets. Still need to pick up a few to complete my collection, perhaps by the end of the year or before Summer. However I have managed to get everything from 2013 with exception to Arkham (and I may manage to get that set fairly shortly as well).</p>
<p>When Batman was re-introduced as LEGO Super Heroes (DC of course) they started off by giving us a lot of re-designed revists of the 2006 Batman waves. With 2013 LEGO took us down a whole new path, introducing different sets, new characters and new attempts at models. This set is the only one (besides Arkham) that isn't related to one of the DC Movies, read on to find out my thoughts on this 25$ gem.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Not much new to say about the box design here, it hasn't changed too much from the initial 2012 design. Though I do believe there are a few minor cosmetic differences, and once again we have the Free Comic Book included announcement as well as a Mini-Figure checklist on the front of the box.</p>
<p>The Instructions are a good thickness, preventing permanent damage even though there is no cardboard protection. This set also includes a sticker sheet, which you have to be careful of because depending on how it's packed you could have one that suffers warping or creasing. They are simple to follow and look impressive, although they don't have any checklists of Mini-Figures in the back like other Themes.</p>
<p>No indeed even the comic books have changed, 2012 featured an extra page showing off the Mini-Figures and which sets they came in. For 2013 LEGO changed this to be a single shot in the back of each short paged comic showing all of the Mini-Figures available from 2012 on one side and all the new ones from 2013 on the other. I'm not too sure on which version I prefer, on the one hand the extra page showed which sets you could find them in. While on the other it is exciting to see a large action shot of all the various characters available from each year.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has some nice parts, you get a single black LEGO wing/batfin, a nice looking cockpit piece some large ski pieces (really just helicopter blades) and two sides of a sculpted transparent ice element for freezing Mini-Figures and encaseing them in ice. The parts I like the most I have to say are the big Ninjago/Mech sword blades being used as ice skateing pieces on Batman's vehicle, fun looking and versatile enough for any MOC you care to use them in.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>LEGO Continues the trend of great Mini-Figures in the 25$ sets, a fact that many fans appreciate because it means they can pick and choose what to collect from each Theme.</p>
<p>In this set you have two new characters and one new interpretation of Batman, we'll start with the newest villain...</p>
<p>Mr. Freeze: I think I'm one collector who is a bit different from most. I think I am anyway because I really like this interpretation of the character compared with the older 2006 LEGO Batman Freeze. This version has an all around better colour scheme for his torso and legs, I like the icy shade of blue he's wearing in his armour. This version also reminds me more of the old 90's Animated series compared to the original with the Insectoid looking helmet, his double-sided torso print combined with the new Atlantis undersea helmet piece looks like a life-support system that would actually work on a character like Freeze.</p>
<p>His freeze ray accessory is nicer looking too, the build used for it and the inclusion of a Ray gun from LEGO Space's newer Alien Conquest/Galaxy Squad figures is an all around better package in Mini-Figure form for this character. The only real problem I have is the fact that his weapon makes him top heavy and unbalanced, so unless he's attached to some studs he can't point his weapon anywhere except down. His facial expression is pretty fun too, a shame they didn't give him a double-sided face though since he could accomodate such a print, but not all Mini-Figures can have double-sided faces.</p>
<p>To combat his frozen nemesis and rescue his friend Batman dons the Arctic suit. For anyone who grew up in the late 80's early 90's like me you're going to love this Mini-Figure, back during the days of Batman Returns there was a Kenner product line and my all time favorite Batman figure from that line, the only one I ever managed to get really, was the Arctic Suit Batman with the white suit.</p>
<p>LEGO has almost perfectly captured the same look, I say almost because the Kenner toy had some black on it still while the Mini-Figure is just all shades of white and light grey. Arctic Batman looks great, he's the polar opposite of his dark suited counterpart for colours, and the print detail just looks wonderful. The white cowl and cape are excellently matched for this new suit, unfortunately LEGO didn't give him white Batarangs. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been a fun little nod.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how changing his costume from black and dark grey to white and light grey protects him from Freeze, but I don't care, he's just loads of fun.</p>
<p>Aquaman is a member of the Justice League, he's got an orange double-sided torso showing off his muscled scale printed costume and dark green legs. He also has a double-sided face with an angry expression and a frowning face, and carries the golden trident from LEGO Atlantis' Theme. I also think this is a first, if I'm not mistaken his hairpiece is the same we saw on Young Han Solo with The Padawan Menace in blonde. Please correct me if I am wrong, I'm pretty sure this is the same hair though.</p>
<p>All three in this set are great and worth the price.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I don't know what you call it, but this set builds a LEGO Bat vehicle for racing across the ice, or water. I don't think it's a Batboat, I have the Batboat from Hunt for Killer Croc so I don't know if you'd call this a Batboat. Anyway, things to note about this build...</p>
<p>It uses stickers for details.</p>
<p>Does not use numbered bags.</p>
<p>And is a quick build for almsot 200 pieces, I like the build of this set because it's such a different approach compared to the old Batboat of Hunt for Killer Croc plus the instructions don't make it as hard to follow as those old LEGO Batman sets did.</p>
<p>There's also a really fast little build for an icy prison for Aquaman, which is a nice side-build, but not the main attraction of this set.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>I really like the look of this vehicle. The completed model stands out nicely in the fleet of past Batvehicles as something unique and fun, it isn't too hard to play with, it won't be awkward to hold in your hands after you build it and start playing with it and the placement of the stickers isn't a huge problem. (They may need some help applying them for younger builders though because they are pretty small.)</p>
<p>As added play features, you can drop some Batbombs from the back and the front has two push-fire projectiles that remind me of pizzas. Or frisbees, they have energy projectile looking stickers on them making me think these are small energy bursts of heat to thaw the icy heart of Mr. Freeze.</p>
<p>The ice prison is also really fun and has a nice breakapart play feature, push down on the protruding tile and the two ice bricks will fly apart freeing the character you've trapped. (Aquaman or any other Mini-Figures you care to use.)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this is another great excellently priced set, the Mini-Figures are loads of fun, the completed model just looks and feels fun. I especially like the huge gout of flame coming off the back. I think by now a lot of collectors of the Super Heroes Theme own this one, if you haven't gotten it yet or have been waiting I have to wonder why? It's a great set that works perfectly and I strongly recommend picking it up.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<p>The Batboat is a great build that looks great and sleek.
