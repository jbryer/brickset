"kelano28","2012-12-29T21:46:38.9Z","""I'm Gotham's reckoning...""","<p>To get the bias out of the way, let me start by saying I am a sucker for anything Batman. &nbsp;Let me also add that I really like Nolan's incarnation, as well as the Tumbler&nbsp;bat mobile. &nbsp;When I saw this set coming out, I knew for better or worse that I was going to be picking it up.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box has nice artwork, but it is absolutely littered with advertisements and other messages. &nbsp;Between having comics inside and coming with a Lego Batman game code, most of the sides are completely covered in messages. &nbsp;Not a 'simple' box, but effective.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Some cool parts to be had here. &nbsp;The Bat includes many useful black slopes, and some trans light blue grates (nice!). &nbsp;The Tumbler has a few tan slopes and trans-orange tiles, but nothing too spectacular.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Ah, now we're getting to where this set shines.</div><div><br></div><div>Batman - Here we have a Dark Knight version of Batman. &nbsp;His torso is much more detailed, similar to the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=bat024"">previous dark knight version</a>, but as of right now I think this version is exclusive to this set.</div><p>Bane - This is a fantastic minifig. &nbsp;Bane is in his Nolan form, complete with detailed face mask and even jacket from the film. &nbsp;The printing is very well done, and he even features back printing on his head and torso. &nbsp;I can't say enough about how good this minifig is. &nbsp;</p><p>Commissioner Gordon - Gordo looks fantastic as well. &nbsp;The head printing is spot on, especially the facial hair. &nbsp;The dark hairpiece looks great for him as well, though I don't remember him being a S.W.A.T. member like his torso claims.</p><p>Three minifigures, all excellent and exclusive.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>First we build Bane's Tumbler, which was definitely a fun build. &nbsp;It's a chunky little vehicle, but some good detailing and hidden missiles make the build a little more fun. &nbsp;The Bat, admittedly, is a more interesting build. &nbsp;It has lots of joints and hinges but maintains a sturdy structure nonetheless. &nbsp;Overall it was a quick build, but for a $40 set it felt fair and stayed interesting throughout.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>One reservation I had about this set (that was shared by many) was the size of the Tumbler. &nbsp;After finishing the model and playing with it a bit, I've actually grown fond of the size they chose. &nbsp;Sure, it looks a little 'chibi', but overall I think the scale is pretty close to the sweet spot. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I still really want a <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7888-1"">7888</a>, but in terms of minifig scale that one is the size of a house.</p><p>The Bat is quite an interesting model. &nbsp;There's a lot going on here with joints, hinges, propellers, fans, ropes, and fins all over the place. &nbsp;It's certainly playable as you can move all of these parts, and it does have a couple flick fire missiles (ya know, if you're into that kinda thing). &nbsp;The engine(?) section of the Bat is especially cool, with silvery robot arms creating an engine-like look that is simple yet effective. &nbsp;I also admire the fact that the cockpit has room for two minifigs, so Gordo can ride along without always needing to take the rope. &nbsp;Oddly enough, The Bat also has a slightly 'chibi' feel to it in my opinion.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Much like The Dark Knight Rises, I was a little unsure how I felt after completing this. &nbsp;Sure, it's got all of the ingredients of something great, but did it really pull it off? &nbsp;My answer is a resounding 'sort-of'. &nbsp;The minifigs are exclusive and fantastic, so if they interest you just go buy this set and get it done with. &nbsp;If you want two grand, movie-accurate models, you can certainly invest in better sets in that department. &nbsp;</p><p>In the end, this set is all about contrast. &nbsp;Contrast between Nolan's hyper-serious batman and the charming Lego-fied versions of his vehicles. &nbsp;To some this contrast may seem like a con, like this set isn't true to the content it portrays. &nbsp;But in a way, that's exactly what Lego licensed&nbsp;sets are about, isn't it?</p><p>Happy Building!</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3
"zipper","2013-01-06T16:59:12.993Z","The Bat vs a mini camo Tumbler","<p>Personally, I don't have a huge budget for Legos, so I only ""collect"" Lego <br>Batman sets and this year I will be collecting the TMNT sets as well. With that said, last year was a bit of a disappointment due to the fact that Lego virtually remade the 2006 Lego Batman line (with the Joker's Hideout being the exception). Since I own all of the 2006-2008 Batman sets, the 2012 sets were not very interesting to me. I have tried to collect some of the 2012 sets, but very slowly. 2013 appears to be a little like 2012 remake wise (76000 is a remake of the vehicle from 7783 and a great looking new Arkham set), but 76001 offers a new vehicle to the Lego Batman fleet. So, I'll go on.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I'm not very interested in the boxes these days. Back in the day, Lego use to make their large set boxes with flaps on them where you could look inside of the box. How&nbsp;I long for those again. Otherwise, we now have cool looking boxes, but there's nothing exciting about them. The scene on it looks nice, and the back and sides are filled with things to look at.&nbsp;</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of cool parts included in this set. Some of my favorite are the engine parts for the Bat. They were very well executed in the design of the set. There are also a lot of cool flaps and hinges and other parts that can be used for all sorts of things. The guns that are on the ""arms"" of the Bat are kind of cool too.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This is where the set is set apart from pretty much all of the 2012-present Lego Superhero sets. Even though we have PLENTY of Batman minifigures out there, this one is really cool because it looks like a movie costume rather then the normal Lego costumes. Plus the bonus here is that the new mask actually fits his head properly! This is a first for the new mask for me. I first received this mask in the ploybag set (30160), then 6858, then the Lego Batman dictionary minifig, and all of their masks don't fit properly, which is very disappointing. If you don't know what I'm talking about, when you put the new mask on Batman, you can see where the white on his face ends and the skin color begins in the mask's eye holes. This ""new"" new mask seems to have corrected this problem, thankfully!</p><p>The new Gordon figure is a GREAT addition to Lego Batman. This is the first truely new Lego Batman minifig to come out since 2008. My only gripe is that he's in swat gear, but that's minor. He still looks good.</p><p>The new Bane figure is very is good too. I originally thought that they should have given Bane a mask piece, but in the movie the mask could not be removed (don't ask me how he eats). So in the end, this Bane figure is great and I believe that Lego did great with all three figures.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was fun with this set. All of the instructions are easy to understand and there were no problems building this. It was fun seeing both vehicles come together and it was interesting seeing what the designers needed to do in order to make this a $40 set. There were a lot of clever bits to this set and I had a great time building it.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Okay, here's my beef. This set should have been twice as big. I really really WISH that we would have received a camo&nbsp;copy of the 7888 Tumbler. While I realize that one isn't perfect either, it was MUCH better then this Tumbler. Plus this Tumbler doesn't have any studs to place Bane onto once he's inside. He simply floats in the Tumbler, which I thought was kind of odd for Lego to do.</p><p>The Bat was good (even though it should have been a little bit bigger, not much though), and it's cool that you can fit two figures inside. However, it is a little difficult to get Gordon in the back seat (I broke the bottom end of the Bat once just trying to get him inside), plus Batman's cape is hard to manage inside.</p><p>The cool things about this set though is that you do get a Tumbler, and oddly, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. Even though it's small, I like the proportions.</p><p>Many people may disagree with me on this though, but I like all of the blue pieces on the Bat. Sure, it probably would have looked better all black, but this is a fun look and you get some good blue parts.</p><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a well thought out set and is a MUST have for any Lego Batman fan. You'll be happy to own a new and original Batman vehicle, plus you&nbsp;will now&nbsp;own Gordon!&nbsp;Do yourself a favor and buy this set. You won't be sorry.</p><p>…</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"_add_um","2014-01-06T22:05:42.58Z","Good set, despite its movie inaccuracies.","<p>After months of waiting, Lego finally releases a set based off The Dark Knight Rises in the Super Heroes line as I&#39;m a big fan of the movies for their gritty realistic and mature take on Batman. However it isn&#39;t what I expected nor exactly wanted, that being said it&#39;s still good for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like the 2012 DC Super Heroes box the box art remains mostly the same. The logo in the corner of course is the movie logo. What surprises me is the fact Lego is still using the older DC logo when a newer has been introduced a while back (though it does appear on the side of box in the small print).&nbsp;The instructions are as expected all I can say is the use of orange inside the instructions looks odd. A comic is included but unlike 2012 sets where a unique comic appeared in each set, the 2013 set comics are identical to the theme in this case the comic appears in all Batman sets. The comics are very weak and don&#39;t offer much, but I do like the way it shows all the minifigures at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>We do get some nice parts. What stood out to me was the tan and dark tan bricks which are handy for people who want some rare bricks. That being said you get about three of these bricks. All the tan parts are a welcome addition. A nice short rope piece is included too, I don&#39;t know if it was a mistake but I got a second one as a spare part which seems odd for Lego to do. &nbsp;A sticker sheet is included, I wouldn&#39;t recommend putting them unless you&#39;re a set purist like me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three great minifigures are included and are really the highlight and the main reason I got the set. However <strong>all </strong>&nbsp;the minifigures are inaccurate to their The Dark Knight Rises counterpart. For the&nbsp;first time ever Lego have finally produced a James Gordon minifigure! He&#39;s very nice and comes with a double sided head and a bulletproof vest with SWAT on the front and back printing. I imagine the torso will be very handy for collectors. My only gripe is Gordon never had this outfit during this scene nor even in the movie at all. Personally I would have preferred with his coat and tie like in the movie. It can be excused since this is the first version of him. Also I really hope Lego stop using the Space gun in the Super Heroes sets, they look goofy. Up next is Bane and is probably the most accurate of the three figures when comparing them to the movie. The only thing I see wrong is the colour scheme is a little brighter with olive green on the vest and mask. It would have been nice if there was printing on the side of his too. He looks great though, nice and menacing. Finally, Batman. I like the minifigure but I really don&#39;t understand the decision to make his suit grey instead of black (this also happened in 2008 with The Dark Knight suit). The torso print is the exact same as the one used in comic con Batman in 2011, but it&#39;s now grey. Why Lego just make that figure again because it would have been perfectly accurate to the Dark Knight suit (except the eyes, but that&#39;s to pull off them). That being said I really do like the minifigure, in fact I like them all. All of them are great, it&#39;s just my major gripe is with the Batman figure since Lego had made a more accurate one before.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly standard. It took about a half an hour to complete. The stickers on the side of the Tumbler were a bit akward to put on. But other than that it&#39;s fairly easy. You can see as you&#39;re making it how simple it all is, comparing to Star Wars sets which are little more complex. But I guess this was marketed to a slightly younger audience. And it shows after you finish the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I said before the set was marketed to young kids, so the finished model isn&#39;t all that complex or detailed. But it&#39;s only okay I think. Starting with the Tumbler, firstly I don&#39;t mind the size but I wish Lego put more detail in. I mean the Tumbler should have six wheels (two in the front and four in the back) not four like this one has. What&#39;s funny was the first Tumbler was way too big but had detail and now this one is a little too small and lacks detail. But it&#39;s a hard model to get right, especially&nbsp;when it&#39;s not the &quot;star&quot; of the set. Also the stickers are a little goofy too, why would Bane put his mask on it as a logo? Next we have the Bat. I knew going in this model was for kids not going to be super accurate. The Bat which was all black in the movie now has blue highlights with a bit of red and yellow thrown in. While the colors are off. I actually ended up liking the Bat a lot more than I thought. It&#39;s just a really neat vehicle&nbsp;and does have some swoosh factor. I wish it was a tiny bit bigger and all Lego had to do was not make the Tumbler and use more parts on the Bat. Two barriers are included in the set too, they&#39;re nice and are useful for lego city.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I&#39;ve nipicked most of the set by comparing what it was like in The Dark Knight Rises, the set is decent. I just wished it was not as goofy or intended for younger builders since the movie was mature and gritty. Also all the work should have been used to make the Bat instead of the Bat with the Tumbler. Also the minifigures are the best part of the set. Overall it&#39;s disappointing as The Dark Knight Trilogy fan, I still really do like it.&nbsp;</p>

"Rogue_Colonel","2013-03-27T10:27:32.39Z","""And yes Mr Wayne, it does come in black""","<p>As a fan of the Nolan trilogy I bought the original Tumbler (7888) when it first came out back in 2008, it's a great model, capturing the style and aesthetic of it's big screen counterpart but it's too big, put it next to some Lego Police cars and it's a little silly. &nbsp;Upon seeing this set I was intrigued by both vehicles in one box..</p><p><b>The Figures</b></p><p>Batman, Commissioner Gordon and Bane are all of a high quality and look fantastic, Gordon especially.</p><p><b>The Bat</b></p><p>The real reason I wanted this set, the Bat must have been a difficult set to build and from some of the quotes in other reviews it certainly seems to have been. &nbsp;The set looks right but feels too small, I might have preferred to have had a ""Bat"" all by itself and slightly more to it. &nbsp;The build is fairly quick and gets quite repetitive quite quickly but you do end up with a set that is quite swooshable.</p><p><b>The Tumbler</b></p><p>Considerable smaller than it's previously mentioned iteration, this Tumbler only has room for one minifig (just) and gets daubed with some hilarious stickers (it's for the kids I suppose). &nbsp;There are some clever building techniques but ultimately I'm not a fan, the scale is better but I think it's too small now as opposed to being too big.</p><p><b>Pros</b></p>

<p>Concluding then I don't think we've seen a definitive Tumbler or Bat from Lego as yet and would expect them to get re-done and re-released assuming the line survives (along the same lines as the X-Wing from Star Wars has been redone over the years since it's initial release).</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,2

"Berrus_Brickus","2013-02-02T23:04:00.13Z","Does it have your permission to die?","I would assume that anyone who wanted to see ''The Dark Knight Rises'' has by now, especially since this set was released about half a year after that movie, but spoilers are very possible.<br><br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4>I don't find the image of the set itself on the box very appealing. The bat and tumbler are positioned fine, and actually looks like it might have been inspired from a certain scene of the movie. Gordon though, shooting at the tumbler is quite ridiculous. I am also not so found of the background. It looks more like Drab Suburbs, USA rather than Gotham. The top of the box is nice, with a city facade replacing simple dots. Armored Batman is running out of a black ink blot towards it. This is the first cartoon rendering of a LEGO character on a Super Heroes box I actually really like (Spidey's was okay, but just that). There are various other things around the front of the box you can easily see for yourself which I don't want to bother pointing out, like the Minifigure callout and the ''The Dark Knight Rises'' logo.<br><br>The back of the box has switched from a yellow background to an orange one. Orange and blue, being colorwheel opposites, have a better contrast than blue and yellow, and it looks much nicer, though still not as good as the Marvel boxes. As you could expect, it points out the set's ""play features."" More on that later, but I'll give you a taste. You can open cockpits ''and'' shoot missiles!<br><br>There were two instruction booklets, one for each of the vehicles. The inside of the manual has been changed from blue to orange. I don't understand the color change, but it does not bother me either. Superman has been replaced by Aquaman in the corner and Batman and Joker have changed into their movie armor and jumpsuit, respectively. There is nothing else to note about the instruction books, at least in my eyes.<br><br>The comic included had mostly nice artwork but made less sense than usual. The cover combined aspects from all three DC sets this wave. It was kind of odd having the bat against the moon and the tumbler exiting Arkham even though characters like Aquaman and Poison Ivy would have no place in Nola's universe because they are ""unrealistic"" (I disagree with that about Ivy, but no need to go into that).<br><br>Anyway, the story is pretty much Harley Quinn and The Penguin causing a breakout at Arkham Asylum. (Harley also seems to have a problem with deciding whether or not to wear make-up and the jester's hat). Joker, Ivy, Scarecrow, and Mr. Freeze are let out, but Batman and Robin arrive. Batman is quickly frozen by Mr. Freeze, so Robin does all of the fighting, but the inmates still escape.<br><br>Then, the batsignal shines, and since Batman is frozen Aquaman responds. However, Aquaman is frozen too. Then Batman arrives in a new white suit (how did he escape?), defeats Freeze, and saves Aquaman.<br><br>Then Bane is driving through the streets in his tumbler, and Gordon is scared, cowering in the middle of the street between two road barricades. Then, Batman comes and Bane gets out of the tumbler. The bat shoots at Bane, but nothing happens. So, Batman gets out to, punches Bane once, and everyone is happy.<br><br>Really not a very good story, and Aquaman's hair looks awful. :P<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>Inside of the box are supposedly 368 pieces, a sticker sheet, and a little card (more on that later) in addition to the instructions and comic.<br><br>The parts were not too exciting. There were a few, but most of them were simple and I am really not interested in going to detail. Not really a parts pack. I mean, there are not ''too'' many rare pieces, and the ones that are are not the ones I generally would use.<br><br><h4>Minifigures</h4>Batman is Batman. The suit is technically exclusive, but it really isn't too different from the one released in 2008 sets. Sure, I am one of those people who are capable of pointing out difference after difference, but I don't want to bother. For the most part, he is the same. This is kind of disappointing, since it only ends up feeling like an okay representation of Batman's suit from the movies. First of all, the white eyes are too unrealistic. So is dark gray. Very unrealistic. And he has metallic printing. Even more unrealistic. Nolan jabs aside, gray <i>is</i> too light, but I do like the shiny printing. I actually wish that the whole minifigure could be gunmetal (or rather, the torso and legs) if it can't be black. The hips shouldn't be black if the legs and torso are not going to be. I like it for the minifigure, but it isn't true to the source material and is a sorry excuse for no leg printing. The new cowl is nice, but not as different as I thought it would be. It looks nearly the same in the front, it only makes a difference at the sides. Batman comes with no accessories, not even a batarang.<br><br>Bane also gets some shiny printing. His torso is nice, and probably has some reuse (since I hate the luchador coverall-thing the mainstream Bane has, I might even give him this). The minifigure is pretty accurate, to pictures of the costume, but in the movie it never looked olive green to me, more black or dark blue. Bane only wore anything like this in one scene too, I would much rather he have the trench coat. The face desperately needs side printing, and the top of the head could really use it too. I would suggest that they print the flesh on an olive green head, but after Captain America's golden tan, they are probably better off not doing it as such. Once again, Bane has no accessories. I can't really think of anything that he used in the movie though....<br><br>I actually really like Gordon's face, since it looks enough like other appearances, but otherwise that is the only part which looks like Gordon from the movie. I only ever remember him having his hair swept back and he never wore a SWAT vest. Still both are nice to have. Gordon has a gun, an ADU one. Better than none at all, I guess, but I would like to stock up on old revolvers before they switch to those ugly new ones with The Lone Ranger.<br><br><h4>The Build</h4>I was expecting to start on the road barricades, but instead you start right on bag 1 with Bane and the Tumbler. The build progresses pretty quickly and other than a bit of SNOT on the sides and minimal TECHNIC was basic and not very interesting.<br><br>The Bat is not much better (bags 2 and 3), even though it uses more angling, it is more repetitive and looses points there.<br><br>You actually end with the road barricades and those require no experience at all (except maybe applying stickers).<br><br><h4>The Completed Model</h4>I would like to take this moment to share some quotes from LEGO designer Mark Strafford who has worked on several LEGO action themes in the past five years or so (you can see some of his work in <a href=""http://brickset.com/brickLists/?5289"">this Bricklist</a>).<br><br><i>""Just a word in defense of the Tumbler set - this had to be designed over a year ago based only on concept art, the Designer did not have final images from the movie as they were not done yet, things change during filming and in post production. You all have the luxury of having seen the movie and how it was used, all the plot points were top secret and very few of them are shared with toy companies!<br><br>""Also it has to be buildable by kids (and fun to play with), a secondary colour needs to be brought in to differentiate the layers of black and dark grey - blue is very Batman - the original Tumbler had a lot of yellow hidden away inside it, but in a smaller model like this it's not always possible to hide the brighter colour away.""</i><br><br>That would explain the olive on Bane's costume, some images from when the movie was being shot (or whenever) <i>do</i> show him not only in olive, but also with the tactical vest.<br><br>Yes, I know that the blue in the set is not accurate, but I like it anyway. No, they could not have used dark gray, don't give that argument, dark gray does not give a model the splash of color it needs. Blue however does, and I rather it be blue than yellow or red, both of which are more jarring with black.<br><br>The colorscheme <i>is</i> oddly reminiscent of the old TIE fighters which used blue in place of light gray. I honestly liked that. Though the latest TIE fighter is really an amazing model (it takes a lot for me to say that about Star Wars ships) I did like the blue on the originals because it broke up the black. Honestly, black and grey is boring. Sensible (and yes, realistic) but boring. It might help that I never liked the bat in the first place. I mean, what is it? A helicopter? A plane? A hovercraft? Seriously, if I were ever directing a superhero cartoon, I would probably have a UFO modeled after it as an in-joke. The blue makes it cartoony, a place where it actually fits (again, what was it? Certainly not believable in Nolan's augmented reality).<br><br>You could also argue that splitting the set into two or raising the price point, but from what I understand, LEGO orders the budget and price point of a set and if the designers want them raised, they have to take that up with LEGO, and it is not always possible.<br><br>Why were they making a set based on a dark movie for a kid anyway? The answer to that is Warner Brothers made them. Why they had it released six months later, I don't know (though maybe it had something to do with their contract with Disney?) Anyway, Mark Strafford says:<br><br><i>""That was a great challenge for the Designer - how to make a cool and desirable Batman toy for 6 year old kids who have not seen the movie and also make a recognizable scene from TDKR. It's a tough one, particularly while trying to get two iconic Batman vehicles in a $40 set, (compare it a a SW $40, it stacks up quite well). I think it's pretty cool, but I have held one, maybe it's better in person!""</i><br><br>Considering the general incompleteness of Star Wars sets in that range, he does have a point, but I don't think that is saying much. Anyway, this done with, I will actually get into what <i>I</i> think of the set.<br><br>I actually think that the general design of the tumbler is quite good. Don't let the original set from 2008 fool you, this size is way more accurate, and I can't picture them doing a <i>much</i> better job at both this scale and price. They certainly could though. First of all, the stickers. Two of them are logos for Bane, of his mask, which is unutterably ridiculous. The other four are guns on the sides, which if anything, is just as bad. The orange lights are awful, the flaming exhaust is just as ridiculous, the sides are too smooth, there is a blue plate showing in the back, there is only one windshield, and Bane can only hardly fit inside. Still, the problems that irk me the most are the squareness and the single windshield.&nbsp; What is even worse is that the windshield problem could be solved by a sticker, but they filled up the sheet with giant Bane masks and guns. Still, considering the circumstances (I actually blame WB for this set's size<b>/</b>price problems more than LEGO) this part of the set is not too bad.<br><br>Did I mention that I hate the bat? Anyway, I actually do think that LEGO did a good job taking it from the ""realistic"" Nolan-verse and transforming it into something from a cartoon. Even if it is something I hope crashes, burns, and few remaining parts are sold in scrap yards...(cut off, that could have gotten nasty), again, this is a size-accurate depiction of the Bat and while sleeker and more colorful, still looks like it. Though I have less problems with the bat as a final model than the tumbler, it still has some jarring coloration (some of that yellow and red Mark was talking about is here too and is <i>not</i> hidden) and that string in the back makes no sense to me. I really love that there is room for two in it though. However, being an awful vehicle in the first place, I will probably scrap it.<br><br>This leaves the road barricades, right? Usually I wouldn't mention them (what is there to say?) but they are awfully annoying. I think that the stickers in this set are supposed to have transparent backing, but mine had white, so my barricades have white and black stripes on a yellow tile which looks absolutely awful.

The reason I didn't mention this above is because it was a minifigure part, Gordon's head. Batman and Bane don't interest me much (not that they are bad figures) and if this set included the Selina the Cat-Burglar instead of Gordon, I would have skipped it gladly. Still, another figure would be nice and help justify the vehicles more. I would be okay with either Selina or Talia, though I would prefer the latter. (Fox too, but he sounds unlikely.) Batman is not must-have and I don't think Bane is either, unless you are a collector, but they are still pretty good. Not nearly as great as some of last year's figures, like Joker or Poison Ivy, however. 4<b>/</b>5<br><br><b>Value for Money</b>: Alright, if you are American, like me, it isn't too bad and the Batman game pass helps (I suppose, it is probably driving the price up), but I still think that the $35 point would be more appropriate. Aside from that, it is inflated ''really'' badly in other countries, who I am taking into account for once. 2.5<b>/</b>5<br><br><b>Design</b>: Other than a few problems with the tumbler and colors showing through on the bat, I really admire what they did. Yes, there are MOCs that are loads better, but I would expect them to be. Sure, I do believe fully that LEGO could make much better versions of both of these vehicles than most of the MOCs out there, but the MOCers are not hindered by the same things as the designers. They took the bat and made it cartoony. The tumbler also feels like a good base for a MOC. All this at that $40 price point. 4<b>/</b>5<br><br><b>Quality</b>: I had to take a point off not only for the barricade stickers, but also because Gordon's head (that one piece I paid $40 for...) has a smudge. Thankfully it is on the scared side of which I am not counting on using very much. 4<b>/</b>5<br><br><b>Overall</b>:&nbsp; This set really is only okay. I mean, I can't find myself recommending it very much, even though it isn't too bad (in all honestly, I am looking at it as a parts pack though, despite the score I gave the design). I would say get this only if you are a big fan of the Nolan trilogy or are collecting. Othewise, Bricklink Gordon('s face) and possibly Bane.<br>3.5<b>/</b>5<br><br>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,2
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-12T10:33:12.05Z","The Dark Knight shall Rise","<p><strong>Set #76001 The Bat vs. Bane: Tumbler Chase: </strong>Following on in Set number order, the next Super Heroes set of 2013 was based off the highly impressive Dark Knight Rises film, previously in LEGO Batman we saw a set based on Batman Begins and again on Dark Knight, how fitting that this set would capture the iconic looks of the film. Just a shame we haven't seen Catwoman or other Dark Knight Rises characters in Mini-Figure form matching their on-screen counterparts.</p>
<p>This set was really impressive for me, as it was the first time I got to build a LEGO scaled Tumbler, let's see just how the set ranks.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Do I really need to even mention the box at this point? I like the design a lot, it stands out on the shelf, it shows dynamic action shots of the set and it features some decent looking details on the back for the play features. One thing to note, not sure if this is regional or not, but the Mini-Figure checklist isn't on the front of the box, but rather the top flap.</p>
<p>There are two numbered instructions in this set, again not protected by cardboard. You also have a sticker sheet, this is actually kind of fun because you can build each model using one of the instruction manuals without having too many pages. And it cuts down on the size of the manual, 50$ and higher sets usually have really big, thick manuals that keep everything together. Seperating the three numbered bags and two main builds into two smaller instruction manuals prevents creasing, mangling or otherwise damaged manuals for a set with a box this large. At least I think it does... Uh anyway let's move on to the pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are a lot of nice tan pieces in this set from the Tumbler and a great number of black pieces used in the Bat, some parts that stand out for me are the unique click joints for the Bat's arms and some odd looking Technic bit that looks like a cannon or smokestack, I actually got three in the set, not sure if you're meant to get an extra one of these.</p>
<p>One thing to point out is that a piece was missing from my purchase, I don't know how common this is with the set, but one of the 2x4 blue plates was missing. This doesn't mean you can't build the entire thing, as the piece is more for stability and clicking everything together rather than actual necessity. Still it's nice that LEGO Customer Service can easily replace the part if your set is missing it. It was missing from bag 3 where you build the final parts to attach to The Bat, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and before I forget, I just love studs with string attached to them. They are so useful for any type of MOC requiring that piece it's just not even funny. One of these days I really should try to actually MOC something.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set at this price point only includes three Mini-Figures, they are three really important characters to the film and this is the first Commissioner Gordon we've gotten in LEGO form, still at 50$ I can't help but think it would have been nice for Bane to have a goon on his side to fight Gordon, or even include DKR Catwoman and the Batpod, even if it bumped the price up by 5$ or so that would have added a bit more value to the set and got it scoring a full 5 out of 5 in my books.</p>
<p>Anyway, who's here?</p>
<p>We get Batman of course in his Dark Knight Rises costume, he uses the same cowl and cape piece we're familiar with and even the same double-sided head. The torso and legs are the only new elements here, mostly with the print. Like all Batmen he has a double-sided torso, showing off the look of the suit from Nolan's final film in the trilogy. This is the only Batman who doesn't get a Batarang accessory, not counting any from Polybags of course. His print detail looks great and he's also fun to display with the Man of Steel Superman as Movie Batman.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gordon as I said is new to the Theme and features in this set. He has a dark blue double-sided torso with a SWAT vest on and plain black legs, he also has a double-sided facial print, a normal expression on one side and a fearful one on the other. His hair piece isn't new, his accessory however is a LEGO Space blaster from Alien Conquest if I'm not mistaken. I suppose asking for a real Police issue revolver is something you won't see from LEGO, I think I would have preferred if they gave him some other kind of accessory. A pair of handcuffs or something, at least it wouldn't look so odd and high tech, something more Batman than Commissioner Gordon as far as weapons are concerned.</p>
<p>Bane is the third and final Mini-Figure, he has no accessories, a double-sided torso print showing the costume from the film in startling detail and a facial print that includes back printing for his odd looking mask/life support protective thing. He's also got bare pink flesh arms (a rare sight in LEGO) and two mismatched hands, one flesh tone the other a black glove.</p>
<p>I like all three figures included in this set, all of them really capture the look of the film versions of the characters from recent years and look impressive. They would stand out a bit if we hadn't gotten Man of Steel sets last year, fortunately we did so your collection can be made up of Comic inspired Mini-Figures on one side and movie based ones on the other.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There are two builds in the set using three numbered bags. I was pretty satisfied duing the build of the Tumbler and The Bat in this set, both models really do a great job of capturing the look of the vehicles seen on screen. The Bat isn't 100% screen accurate and I've heard others complain that the Tumbler is just too small, but honestly in my opinion both builds are fun and scaled just right next to each other.</p>
<p>The steps in manual one are easily followed and manual two seperates the build for the Bat between bags two and three.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Tumbler has a few stickered details, the cannons on the side and Bane's symbol/logo thing, plus as noted before it's a little on the small side compared to how big the vehicle would be in real life. This is a necessary evil because the Bat would wind up being much larger and harder to hold/play with if they were both to proper scale.</p>
<p>The Tumbler has two hidden flick-fire missiles. This is a great feature, I like that you can hide them so they don't interrupt the look of the model, which is fun to play with and have rush around escaping from The Bat.</p>
<p>The Bat isn't 100% screen accurate as I noted before, of course such a complicated looking flying vehicle would be hard to make in LEGO form because it's like... Well it's like one of the movie designs for The Transformers films, loaded with tiny details, moving parts and loads of curves.</p>
<p>I like The Bat for what it is, a blocky representation of the vehicle as seen in the movie. It captures all of the important details, has moving side-arms, moving wings and a&nbsp;tow cable&nbsp;so it can carry away the bomb. (Not included in this set.) It looks so different compared to the other Batvehicles from the Theme that it just looks fun, I really like this design.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that for 50$ this is a really impressive set. It includes three great looking Mini-Figures (should have at least been four though, I mean the Dynamic Duo Funhouse had 5 figures and was around 45$ if memory serves) and two great looking vehicle builds. Both of which are fun to play with and have flick-fire missiles that remain hidden from obvious sight.</p>
<p>There are some sticker details instead of printed elements, which some may not like. And the scale of the vehicles might be a bit too small for others, I however like and recommend this set strongly.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
