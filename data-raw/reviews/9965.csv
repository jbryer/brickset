"ninjagoyo","2012-12-23T00:42:19.66Z","Everything a LEGO set should be!","<p>I am not a Spiderman fan. I never followed the comic (except during the original Venom arc), I didn't like the movies and I don't plan to see the next movie. Despite that, Spider-Cycle Chase is probably my favorite LEGO set to date as an AFOL (which is only the past three years, but still). In my opinion, it is absolutely flawless.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box looks slick and has a nice heft. The cover scene is dynamic. I love that sturdy, stiff high-quality cardboard... some sets in a similar size box have seemed flimsy to me (Hero Factory comes to mind) and become easily bowed. Not this one. I usually flatten boxes but I am going to keep this one for display because it looks great.</p><p>It comes with a comic that I actually like a lot, much better than most actual Marvel comics of the past 20 years. It is wordless, which is always a nice touch artistically to let the pictures truly carry the story. The fusion of LEGO and four-color comic styles is carried off very effectively. I love it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I admit that I don't have an encyclopedic part knowledge, and the parts lookup for this set doesn't seem to be working on Brickset at the moment to check, but there were tons of pieces in this that were totally new to me, like the Venom back piece with a Technic pin connector, and the four-clip ring that fits on it. Also the 1x2 plate with a Technic pin hole on it. It also comes with tons of pieces that while not unique, are extremely useful. Lots of brackets, lots of nifty Technic pieces, lots of handles in colors I didn't have before. Four silver grills and two silver 1x1 round tiles. It's a parts bonanza. I plan to buy several more just for parts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I only even looked at this set originally because of Venom, the only thing that interests me in the whole Spider-man continuity, and Nick Fury. They are both great-looking figs to me. Neither have as much fancy printing on legs, backs etc as some other figures, but they don't need it. Venom's ingenious back-piece and tentacles make it one of the most innovative and impressive figs I've ever seen.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't care much about the Spider-Man figure, it seems fine though. I love that web-slinging piece, wish it came with an extra.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is ingenious. I'm not going to ruin it for you, it is quick but&nbsp;delightful every step of the way. There is a lot of Technic in it, but also plenty of solid plate-stacking.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The cycle and the car both look super and &nbsp;roll and swoosh fantastically well. The conversion feature works like a charm. They are extremely solid builds, not going to fall apart under any kind of normal play. The playability is excellent with the conversion from ground to flight mode, and the weapon deployment on the car. &nbsp;Not to mention Venom's menacing little satellites.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a set with three highly desirable, licensed minifigs, an absolutely top-rate design featuring a sensational collection of parts, and gives you two sturdy, ultra-playable vehicles at the end. Yet it comes in at well under 10c per piece. Honestly, LEGO has absolutely hit it out of the park with the value of this set. And again, I am saying this not as some Spider-Man fanboy, far from it. I won't be getting any of the other Spidey sets. The set had to win me over on its merits and it did, it really wowed and put a grin on my face. I honestly cannot think of one thing that could be changed about this set to improve it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2013-01-08T10:49:29.523Z","Spider cents tingling. ","<p>I've followed Marvel for a good couple of years now, although perhaps I'm reluctant to call myself a ""true believer"" for lack of a certain encyclopaedic knowledge of the Marvel universe that some people seem to have. Nor am I a particularly avid reader of Spider-Man. However, I think I can say this: although Spider-Man has certainly come a long way from his geeky teenage days, what sets him apart from Batman or Iron Man is his every-man-ness. Peter Parker doesn't have millions of dollars or an international megacorporation at his disposal. He is a guy with spider powers who is trying to do his best.</p><p>But I suppose an unwavering sense of morality doesn't sell toys, so here we are with Spider-Man and his, er, Spider-Cycle, which Peter would have <em>absolutely no use for since he swings easily&nbsp;around the city his webs</em>. Maybe no one else is thinking about that. But I am. </p><p>Personal biases aside, I suppose I should actually talk about this set. I came for the Minifigs: Spider-Man, Venom, and (finally!) Nick Fury in his ""Ultimate""/movie form. I did not buy any of the previous Spider-Man sets, so all three Minifigs are new to me, and they're all of really nice quality. Venom is particularly cool, though the little tendrils attached to his back are slightly finicky. Fury fits in very well with the rest of his Avengers compatriots from the first wave of Marvel sets, so you won't be disappointed with that either. If anything, these guys are definitely the highlight of the set and probably the main reason why you'd buy it at all.</p><p>There's two builds here: the aforementioned Spider-Cycle and the SHIELD flying car thing. Unfortunately, the Spider-Cycle is pretty atrocious in my opinion and probably serves as nothing more than a bolster for the piece count, though my opinion may have already been previously coloured by the fact that I really don't think Spider-Man wants or needs a flying motorcycle, but hey, what do I know. I guess it's made out of a handful of useful pieces that creative minds will surely find a more effective use for, but I think the build as it is is not very good. </p><p>The flying car is a great deal better and actually pretty fun to build and play with, though I wish that it was in dark blue as opposed to green (!?) to match with the Avengers sets. It has a bulky, old-school sort of feel to it, though it sits only one in spite of it being so large. The wheels fold in beneath the car to go into ""flight mode"" and the back folds out to launch a missile, which is pretty cool. The windshield is also cleverly attached using clips to create a more aerodynamic look. I wasn't expecting to be impressed by the car, but I was, and it makes up for the absurdity of the Spider-Cycle. </p><p>Overall, this is a fun little set with great Minifigs and a nice build, though the Spider-Cycle leaves a lot to be desired. If you are drawn to the Minifigs, picking this set up is a no-brainer, and the SHIELD car, at least, will not disappoint. </p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-12T21:25:24.253Z","Flies a Bike, Saves Nick Fury, Does Whatever a Spider Does?","<p><strong>Set #76004 Spider-Man: Spider-Cycle Chase: </strong>Moving right along for the 2013 Super Heroes sets, this time we're talking about the first Marvel set of the year. (Mostly because the numbering sequence breaks up the Man of Steel sets at this point.)</p>
<p>Five sets from Marvel this year just like there were five new Retail sets for DC. (Arkham is exclusive to LEGO Stores, and certain TRU stores that picked it up for the holidays.) And what a group of sets they were, featuring characters from Iron Man 3 and Marvel's Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, all of the sets are real winners. The merits of this set are as follows:</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>This set features the Marvel Ultimate Spider-Man logo on the side of the box, other than that there isn't much different between this year's Marvel Super Hero boxes and the others. Again I like the design for them, the back of this box doesn't have as many images as the others though, which makes sense as there aren't as many features.</p>
<p>The instruction manual is your typical booklet for 25$ LEGO sets, a nice rectangular shaped three step manual showing each of the contents from the three numbered bags and what you build with each. Easy to follow and some great design choices.</p>
<p>The free comic in this set is where you'll find images of all the Mini-Figures from 2012 and 2013 on the back in a nice action shot, the contents show a short story behind the adventures in the two Spider-Man sets from last year. And spoils the presence of all the killer new Mini-Figs from each set. The comics aren't to everybodies tastes, but they do offer LEGO's trademark fun and light hearted touch in storytelling.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has minimal interesting parts, the four-bar c-clip Technic attachment thing is useful (I'm not sure on the proper name), and it has 8 black vine pieces plus a few green parts for the SHIELD vehicle, not much else jumps out at me as being impressive, rare or noteworthy.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set features a Mini-Figure we saw in a Hard to Find set (Which I still need to track down) plus two brand new Mini-Figures. Well new prints for one of them, since SDCC introduced a black suited Spider-Man in 2012 as an exclusive.</p>
<p>Spider-Man: Compared to the LEGO Studios Spidey I used to own this version has a nice semi-classic looking costume, more inspired by the cartoon and comics than the original movie trilogy. He's a pretty fun looking Mini-Fig and has a lot of decent printing. He comes with a single webline, but there are actually two in the set which means you can pose him webswinging between buildings.</p>
<p>Nick Fury Agent of SHIELD: (Or Director whichever you prefer), this Mini-Figure is more based on the cartoon than the movies, he's dressed in a blue SHIELD uniform, not the trench coat and leather ensemble seen in the Avengers. He's a really fun Mini-Fig and this is the first time we've seen him, his print is also great with that double-sided torso. He's got the space gun from Alien Conquest, and while characters in DC comics look wierd using this weapon an Agent of SHIELD would have a futuristic looking blaster gun since they seem to use alien tech when building stuff.</p>
<p>Venom: This is a different Venom from what I'm used to. He's based on the newer cartoon series so he's got some wierd accessories. The print is a solid looking one for the character of Venom, the back bracket piece you attach the black vines to cliped on that four ring of c-clips simulates the symbotes ability of shape changeing and attacking with tendrils rather nicely.</p>
<p>The odd brick accessories with the bits of symbitote attached look very confusing, is he tossing globs of symbiote at the enemy or is he just changing his hands into whirling blade filled menaces? Either way they're pretty cool looking and a fun (if easily misplaced) feature for the younger fans.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Bag 1 builds both Spidey and Venom plus the titular Spider-Cycle, it's a short build and pretty clever actually to add the hovering ability into the vehicle.</p>
<p>Bag 2 and 3 finish off by building a SHIELD car, this set has stickers for details, so once again no printed elements for the SHIELD logo, much like Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape. The build here is nice and fun though, building in another hovering function that really is a simple/neat little gimmick.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Spider-Cycle is a bit off the wall, I mean Spider-Man isn't a character with loads of cash to build vehicles like Tony Stark or Batman, so him having such things like this and the upcoming Spider-Copter or Spider-Trike is purely for the younger fans. Still it's a nice little side-build model and the hover feature is really clever.</p>
<p>The SHIELD Hover Car is the crown jewel of this set, it's a solidly built vehicle with a nice hover feature incorporated into the model (the wheels turn sideways on Technic axles) and has a hidden Flick-Fire missile which I like because it's hidden and doesn't stick out poorly on the model like some sets have. The only downside is sticker details instead of printed elements. We've had four SHIELD vehicles by now in four different Marvel sets, it'd be nice to at least have the SHIELD logo printed on some bricks.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is yet again a winning 25$ priced set from LEGO Super Heroes, LEGO has been doing a great job making 25$ sets with great models, fun and collectible Mini-Figs and some interesting play features. Fans of the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon might appreciate the sets more, still I recommend this for Super Heroes enthusiasts looking for a decent set to compliment their Avengers ones from 2012. Also it's the only way to get Nick Fury yet, recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"NuparuNuva","2013-04-20T13:30:20.677Z","A Venom-ously great set","<p>I bought this set one day for the price of $20. Not only had I been looking at buying this one for a while, but I also noticed the great price/piece ratio.</p><p>And this set does not disappoint. It contains 3 great figs (Spider-Man, Venom, and Nick Fury), 2 of which (Nick Fury and Venom)&nbsp;are exclusive, and 1 of which (Nick Fury) is a must-buy for Avengers completionists.</p><p>Nick is a very good minifig, my only complaint being that he isn't wearing the black trench coat he was wearing in Marvel's The Avengers. Spider-Man is, to my knowledge, the same as in the other 2 recent Spidey sets, but he's still a good fig. And then there's Venom. Venom is one of my favorite figs from&nbsp;2013 so far. He's got great printing, and he has&nbsp;tentacles on his back that make him look totally awesome. If you don't like the tentacles, you can detach them and use them as a web (They're connected to the back via a Technic axle).</p><p>The main builds of this set are Nick's green S.H.I.E.L.D. flying car ad Spidey's flying Spider Cycle. Both are well done, especially the car. It uses some clever techniques (the windshield attachment is a stroke of genius) and has some cool features (the hidden flick-fire is cool, even if it is still just a flick-fire). </p><p>So, onto the pros and cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>

"InspectorEddie","2014-10-11T05:43:13.353Z","My Spider sense is tingling about this one!","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box... not much to say about it, a piece of cardboard that ended&nbsp;up in a recycling center&nbsp;some where in the mid-west United states. As for the instructions&nbsp;I wish they made a Spiderman man movie that was as good as these instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Yes, plenty of parts in them... 237 total, give or take. Noting totally unique.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spiderman... if you don&#39;t have him yet, now is your chance. Nick Fury, agent... I mean Leader of SHIELD, a unique figure&nbsp;to the set.&nbsp;VENOM! Yes, Venom, complete with his extra arms (kind of like Doc Oc) Venom is&nbsp;a Spiderman / Marvel&nbsp;favourite since he made his debut in ASM #299. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, not much to it, little&nbsp;to no curse words muttered during the construction.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is where it ranks high, if there was a higher number than 5 &nbsp;that could be selected for playability I would have chosen it, like maybe 100. I have to admit I wasn&#39;t really on board with this set, it looked uninspiring, boring...until i put it together and gave it to my son. Just the right amount of moving pieces to make it seem more like a &quot;toy&quot; than a &quot;model.&quot; Easy&nbsp;transformation of&nbsp;the spider-cycle and the shield car really made this great . One minute it is&nbsp;a car or motorcycle&nbsp;and with a qucik flip of the wheels you have a hover car/ bike allowing you to take the higher roads through Lego city.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great Set, and as I write this i see it dropping on prices at some major realtors.&nbsp;</p>

"scolioreset","2014-06-12T09:01:11.553Z","The figs make you go for it!","<p>I decided to jump back into Lego because of this kind of sets: cool&nbsp;minifigs that are easy to buy. I like when they give this opportunity for kids, teenagers and adults to buy their most-wanted figures. Now we&#39;re looking at the Spider-Cycle Chase which has the less interesting title... but hides something pretty interesting.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I really expected a smaller box for this kind of sets. Some sets are more expensive and have smaller boxes. I expected to pay 35$ but it was 25$ which is pretty interesting. I wish the instructions would get the colors right. Been 4 years since my last Lego set and I was a bit lost for some gray pieces again... and I&#39;ve good eyes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Venom parts were new to me. I used to play with Lego sets when I was a kid but jumping back as an adult make me wonder why we didn&#39;t get these pieces before. I&#39;m actually impressed with some of them but because it&#39;s a car and a cycle, I didn&#39;t expect much from the parts. It&#39;s basic...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is where it hits perfection. You buy this set for the minifigures. Spider-Man has been in almost every Marvel set but if this is your first Spider-Man themed set, this will be your last because you don&#39;t need him again, again and again... especially if you buy cheaper sets for your kid or yourself. You get this one, you won&#39;t need another and yes, he comes with a white rope. I also wish there&#39;ll be side-printings and printings on the legs too. Nick Fury is here. I&#39;m not a fan of the Ultimate Spider-Man show, I didn&#39;t watch it personally... but I liked The Avengers movie... Hey, it&#39;s Nick Fury! Come on! He&#39;s the man, he&#39;s the director of the S.H.I.E.L.D. and if you love the Avengers and you got all of the Avengers figures like Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man and Thor... then you need your Nick Fury. Sure it&#39;s not based on Samuel L. Jackson but the man is finally here so we can accept it.</p>

<p>For me, Venom steals the show in this set! I LOVE Venom since the 90&#39;s series of Spider-Man. He&#39;s the doppelganger of the webslinger... You can&#39;t hate Venom and we&#39;ve been waiting for him since the first sets of Spider-Man and I do remember the Studios sets with the Green Goblin. But now, Venom is here and that&#39;s all that matters. Great design all around, love the tendrils and the projectiles too thatcan be hold by Venom. I wish there would be a black rope so there could be a fight between Spider-Man and Venom in the air but if you got any net and black ropes in your collection, then it&#39;s great for your stop-motion too. And... Lego... it&#39;s time for The Lizard and Carnage... Just saying...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was easy but some gray pieces in the instructions were a bit confusing. The build was not too complicated but ended to be a bit repetitive and had no much surprise and that&#39;s a bit disappointing. I actually liked building the car because I expected something much smaller for the value. And stickers are definitely not a good thing, especially for these sets when kids will definitely buy them for playing... or parents will offer them...&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car looks great! Besides the stickers, I expected the car to be smaller but I like the details, the spoiler, the missile launcher which is hidden. I do wish an arm piece to hold Fury&#39;s gun. The cycle is fine but... I don&#39;t see Spider-Man in a vehicle anytime but for kids, it&#39;s a good thing for playability. Lot of functions for both vehicles because of the tires.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>20$ in the US, 25$ in Canada... for this set? This is a must for any Spider-Man/Marvel fans who need a specific Lego set to show on the shelve or play with. Great value for pieces, two cool vehicles and, again, you get three excellent minifigures, two of them being exclusive to this set (excluding Venom from the Juniors set but he doesn&#39;t have the backpiece for the tendrils that make him look fantastic)... and you&#39;ll be happy. I say it again! 20-25$ for two vehicles (one that could&#39;ve ended in a 15$ set), three excellent and minifigures, two exclusive ones... This is how you do it, Lego! Kids will want the vehicles, they&#39;ll want Spider-Man and adults will want Nick Fury and Venom but the vehicles are great. Everyone wins with this set.</p>

"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2015-06-27T16:13:58.977Z","""Peter, with great sets come great minfigures.""","<p>I picked this up from a Toysrus&nbsp;mainly for the figures. As a huge Marvel fan, this was a must buy. (Little did I know this would NOT be Spidey&#39;s last appearance in a set. Not by a longshot). And this was only his second set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box contains two or three bags, a sticker sheet, a smaller sized&nbsp;instruction booklet, and the comic book for this set and the Daily Bugle Showdown. The box depicts various play features of the model, and has the glossier texture to it, which I belive makes the opening and untaping easier.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are mainly grey, black, and green, making up the Spidey-cycle, the S.H.I.E.L.D car, and Venom&#39;s venom gobs. The set includes 8 Bionicle vine pieces in black, which are pretty cool pieces. It comes with various pieces such as a green hood, a windshield, and eight of the same tires and rims, which are useful for making custom vehicles.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For many, the main thing that sells this set for people will be the minifigures. All three are easily notable and popular figures among Marvel fans.</p>

<p><strong>Spiderman</strong>: First up is the web-slinging hero. This version has appeared in seven sets as of 2015, making him not very rare. He has a bright cartoonish&nbsp;color scheme of red and blue, with nice back printing of a spider. He does, however, have generic blue legs, which could have been more detailed, but all the same he&#39;s a great, fun minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Nick Fury</strong>: Next up is perhaps the most important minifgure in this set, but not necessarily the coolest. This version from the Ultimate Spiderman Universe dons a navy blue field agent outfit rather than his trench coat. He has his iconic eyepatch&nbsp;printed on his head, and his weapon of choice is the Alien Conquest theme blaster. Nick Fury is a coveted figure, though not hard to get, because of his single appearance in this set. To date, he has only since appeared in the 76042 Helicarrier, his MCU version. This makes him difficult to get in such an expensive set.</p>

<p><strong>Venom</strong>: Perhaps the main sell of this we is the well known for of Spiderman, the symbiote&nbsp;Venom. He is extremely dangerous because Spiderman cannot sense him coming. In this set, his neck bracket connects four BIONICLE vines to his back as tendrils, which look great. His tongue and sharp yellow teeth are emphasized on his face, making him look rabid and crazy. His white spider pattern is expressed on his chest, and sadly he too has generic legs which are black this time. He is equipped with two gobs of symbiote venom goo which can latch onto the car&nbsp;or bike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, the figures included in this set are a nice assortment, though not too rare as venom is included in a 2014 Juniors set, 10665.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took just under half an hour, applying stickers and all, and was interesting using the technic pieces to make the wheels flip up and out. Pieces were built sideways at sometimes, making it a fun build, short and sweet.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model gives you exactly what you&#39;d look for in a set; the good guys versus the bad guys in a nice showdown. You get a flying car &nbsp;which will be a favorite among kids, with a pop up hidden flick missile, and the wheel open out from beneath the car. The build allows you to drive the car and put it into hover mode. As does the spider-cycle, which allows the wheel to open out more and up at some angles. The playability is great, although it slightly difficult to get the driver into the car, be it Nick Fury or someone else. The gobs don&#39;t attach all too easily, though there are places where you can pop it on to either vehicle. Nice playability, and something that could just as easily be used in a city or other display.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A couple years into the future, this set costs slightly more on the secondary market, but is still worth it&#39;s weight in bricks. The set is a must have for Marvel fans hoping to get a collectible without breaking the bank, and the contents themselves are can go wih any theme. Whether you&#39;re buying for an adult or a kid, this is a nice set that I would recommend getting for any age. The minifigure selection is nice, the pices great, and the price per piece is under 10&cent; a piece. The only qualms I have is Lego&#39;s use of random color use for bricks that aren&#39;t easily seen. They may be included just for the sole purpose of piece variety, but they do cause the model to look slightly off from some angles. Otherwise, I d say buy it. Another job well done by Lego!</p>

<p>Happy building!</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-16T23:31:56.267Z","Spider-Man: Spider-Cycle Chase Review","<p>The&nbsp;Spider-Man: Spider-Cycle Chase set is a great set from the Marvel Superheroes&nbsp;theme. It includes the Spider-Cycle, a Shield car, and 3 minifigures. It was released in 2013 for&nbsp;$19.99 and has 237 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><b>Spider-Man- </b>This version of Spider-Man was in 13 sets and I think it was overused. The printing is not that detailed and is boring after you get so many. 5/10</p>

<p><strong>Nick Fury- </strong>This was the first Nick Fury ever released but I like the one in The Shield Helicarrier set released in 2015. This version of Nick Fury has good printing but just a basic Shield outfit. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Venom- </strong>This Minifigure has great printing for Venom. It was the first Venom minifigure released&nbsp;in a set and is a great minifigure. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Shield car has a good design and great play features. The Spider-Cycle also has a pretty good design. On both vehicles the wheels can turn to make it look like they are flying which is a great play feature. The back of the Shield car can turn up to reveal a flick fire missile which is good for playability. 10/10</p>

<p>This set has good designs and great play features. Its a great set for playability but if you don&#39;t care about playability then the designs of the vehicles look good too. The minifigures all look good but Spider-Man is a bit boring because this version of him is in so many sets. In my opinion this is a really good set that offers alot.</p>
