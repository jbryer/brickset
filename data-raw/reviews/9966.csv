 <b>The figures:&nbsp;</b></p>
<div>
 The figures up for grabs in this set are-&nbsp;</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <i>Spiderman </i>is a nice figure but he also appears in 2 other sets so nothing too special here.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <i>Dr Doom</i>&nbsp;is a very nice figure, he has cool printing, and the good thing is he&#39;s exclusive to this set so far.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <i>Nova </i>has a great new molded helmet which isn&#39;t bulky like iron mans helmet, he has a nice new printed torso and a nice new printed head, the head reminds me of cat woman&#39;s.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <i>Beetle </i>has some cool molded wings which I received 2 off in my set, he also has nice printing on his torso and head.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <i>J.Jonah Jameson isn&#39;t</i>&nbsp;the greatest of figures but he has a nice head print.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>Dr.Doom&#39;s flying machine:</b></div>
<div>
 Dr doom&#39;s flying machine looks great and it also has some playability with it which is flick fire missiles, these are pretty meh but oh well, the other play feature is a cool crane grabber that can pick up any figure of the ground and drop them in the sky. The cockpit is very nice and sleek and the windscreen has a nice fit to the cockpit. There are also 2 black turbine pieces which are very nice and give the plane a futuristic look. And to those of you that don&#39;t like stickers there are only a few of them on the plane.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>The Bugle Building:</b></div>
<div>
 The building is the&nbsp;pi&egrave;ce<span dir=""auto""> de r&eacute;sistance</span> to this set. It has a great look, a great feel and is just well worth the money. Alright it might have a few stickers to it but that ain&#39;t bad. On the ground floor it consists of a few doors, windows and a flower pot that looks a bit lonely by itself but I suppose you can&#39;t put much else on the ground floor. On the second floor there is a safe that Dr doom can steal by pushing the red button to launch the window of and he can grab it with his cherry/crane grabber. Theirs also a canvas where Jonah portrays different pictures of spiderman and his alter ego. The is also a fire escape that is a nice little feature. On the third floor there is a desk for Jonah with a nice green chair and lamp with a computer and that&#39;s about it on this floor. On the roof there is quite a few cool play features such as a trap door to drop an unsuspecting figure into Jonah&#39;s office, there&#39;s also a lever which you put spiderman in front off and you flick it to make him swing from one end of the building to the other, this works really well but it all depends on where you place part of his white web/string. The last play feature on the bugle is a big picture of Jonah on the front of the building asking a broadcast message which reads, &quot;who is spiderman?&quot; and if you push a red lever on the roof of the bugle with a bit off force it launches the broadcast message quite a lengthy distance.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>The lamppost and garbage bin:</b></div>
<div>
 There isn&#39;t much to say about these but the lamppost looks nice but doesn&#39;t really do much except just be part of the scenery. The garbage bin can launch figures quite far as long as you give the brick at the back a hard enough push. The only thing that&#39;s bad about the bin is that it looks stupid when in use because the figures have to stand in the bin to be thrown out of it, I suppose at least it hides the catapult.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>Pros:</b></div>
<div>
 You get extra beetle wings.</div>
<div>
 Great price to piece value.</div>
<div>
 Awesome figures.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>Cons:</b></div>
<div>
 None whatsoever.</div>
<div>
 &nbsp;</div>
<div>
 <b>Overall:</b></div>
<div>
 10/10</div>
<div>
 And great value for money to say it&#39;s a &pound;39.99 set for 476 pieces.</div>
<div>
 I&#39;d say if you like spiderman and superheroes this is a definite buy.</div>

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-13T20:36:22.713Z","Spider-Man And Doom","<p><strong>Set #76005 Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown: </strong>Continuing on with the 2013 Super Heroes sets we now come to a really impressive set, and I do mean impressive. This thing has a lot of great fun features, an excellent selection of brand new Mini-Figures never before seen in LEGO form and is an ok model to boot. The only complaints I have concerning this set will be revealed below.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>I really love the look of the images on this box, they really showcase the sheer fun of this set. You get to see all the awesome Mini-Figures in a series of action poses and the action features of the set, then there's more fun on the back with a lot more content than the Spider-Cycle Chase set that's for sure.</p>
<p>The instructions for this set are a bit confusing, mostly because they are seperated into three booklets. I'm not sure why LEGO chose to do this, was it really more cost effective to have the build for the Daily Bugle start in book 1, move to book 2 and put the build for the Doom vehicle in book 3? It would make more sense to just have this seperated by two booklets honestly.</p>
<p>1 and 2 are your standard larger sized manuals for sets of this price range, booklet 1 shows you the build for numbered bag 1 and booklet 2 continues with bags 2 and 3, manual 3 finishes off with 4 and 5, and is a smaller sized manual of the kind found in 25$ set price ranges.</p>
<p>No protection for anything in this set, which really is a nuissance because this set includes a sticker sheet for details, and this time... This time my luck was not with me, the sticker sheet was creased slightly and to this day some of the stickers actually peel slightly off the bricks and plates they're placed on. It's really quite unfortunate as the details really make the set.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has so many parts I'm not entirely sure where to start for the useful parts for MOCing... Ok let's try to highlight a few good parts, first off the office style window pieces are useful and great looking. There's a nice lamppost part, some studs with strings and webline parts. And just so many more parts honestly I could go on for another five paragraphs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set features a load of great Mini-Figures, 4 brand new characters and Spidey of course. It's a really impressive set, although the choice not to include certain characters is a bit curious, I would expect to have seen at least one of the Fantastic Four in this set to help Spidey deal with their nemesis. Still, perhaps we'll see them soon.</p>
<p>Spider-Man is the same Mini-Fig as we saw in Spider-Cycle Chase. Not much more to say about him here honestly, he's the same great figure with the same print details.</p>
<p>J. Jonah Jameson is brand new to this set, he's got a camera accessory and is wearing a nice light grey/blue suit with red tie. There's a double-sided torso print, although the back of the printing is kind of minimal on the details. A few lines showing the cut of the suit and that's pretty much it. He's also got a double-sided face, with a neutral expression on one side and an angry one on the other. His hairpiece is a dark grey version of the Joker's.</p>
<p>Nova is the last hero in the set and has a really impressive looking helmet piece sculpt, he has a nice dark blue body colour with a double-sided torso print for his costume's design, which is pretty impressive. He's useing two red studs to simulate energy blasts and has a double-sided face, with a neutral expression and an angry expression... Hmm I detect a pattern here. The only downside is the fact that his helmet doesn't quite hide the extra face on his back, you can see the bottom of his mouth from certain angles.</p>
<p>Beetle is just awesome, a brand new villain from the Marvel universe he's got a great torso and head print and a fun new insect wing/back accessory piece. He's also useing the alien conquest weapon from LEGO space, and again while DC characters from Earth look odd weilding this weapon I can see Marvel characters in costumes using it because... Well they do use them more often in the comics than realistic weapons.</p>
<p>Doctor Doom truly stands out as one of the best inclusions of a Marvel villain in a LEGO set (until Red Skull and MODOK show up in the new 2014 sets.), Doom is magnificent. Doom is powerful. Doom is the ultimate villain of the Marvel universe, one of the most iconic with an almost Darth Vader vibe. He comes with a nice double-sided torso print on a green coloured body, he has grey arms. His print follows down onto his legs and the look is very neat.</p>
<p>He has a rich dark green cape, a rare colour and also rare is the green hood. his facial print is single-sided, but captures the look of the masked villain pretty nicely. The ruler of Latveria is a welcome addition to this set, and much more impressive honestly than if we'd just gotten another Spidey villain. (Though it might have been nice to see The Kingpin, perhaps in the future.)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I like the build for the Bugle in this set, it's a nice modular build that has you work on each floor one at a time and then connecting them once you've finished each section. The stand out aspect of this set's build though is Doom's ship, it's a nice satisfying flying vehicle to build with a great play feature and a nice swooshable design.</p>
<p>All of the builds are easily worked on in this set, a fun extra is the buildable garbage bin. I do think that more printed elements and less stickers would have been better, some of the logo elements and the window design would have been nice to be printed on the bricks instead of stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Daily Bugle reminds me a little of the build from my old Spider-Man Action Studio Studios set, only this build is ten times better. You have a fuller, more solid looking building (no cardboard cutouts this time) and even though the interior is sparsely populated with furniture it still works quite nicely.</p>
<p>There's a clever build for three balconies on the side of the building making up the fire escape and as I said before it's loaded with fun play features. Pull a pin on the roof and a trap-door sends Mini-Figs tumbling inside. Push another pin and the sign on the top of the building will pop off. A third pin is there so that you can knock Beetle down or (once attached to a webline) send Spidey swinging off the roof into action. (This gimmic doesn't work as well as the others, but it's a nice feature that could have been left out.)</p>
<p>And of course a fourth pin is going to pop one of the windows off so that Doom has access to the Daily Bugle's safe, a clever little micro-build that you make to hide the Secret Identity of Spider-Man, this is what Doom is after. And the claw on his flying ship is meant to grip the safe and pull it away, however it can also be used to grab Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>Doom's vessel also has flick-fire missiles that don't stand out too much, but are still a noticeable distraction from the overall streamlined design. I still like the vehicle enough to ignore this aspect of it, it's fun to hold and fly around the dangling claw is suitably menacing and it's a rare sight indeed to get vertical take-off and landing craft in LEGO form.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this set is pretty impressive for the price range, it's just a little over 10 cents per piece so there's a lot of value there, my one real complaint is the stickers for design. And more importantly the fact that these stickers are not protected so easily damaged during the packing process.</p>
<p>I'm also a little dissapointed we didn't get a Human Torch to help Spidey fight Doom, after all Doom is the nemesis of the Fantastic Four. Other than that I think this is a really solid set, it's got a lot of fun little features and the Mini-Figures really top off a nice looking set. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
