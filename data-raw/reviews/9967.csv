That's not SAYING much, mind you, as this set has its rather obvious flaws, but it's still the greatest of an uneven lot.<div><br></div><div>MINIFIGS<br>The minifigures in 76007, I dare say, are the selling point. For the first time in LEGO Super Heroes we get a dedicated Tony Stark figure (rather than him in one of his armour). Tony is wearing his under-clothes of sort, and it's nice to see the arc reactor printed onto his shirt. He has printing on the back, and two faces - one cocky, one worried. Minor niggle here - they seem to have given Tony brown hair. Does he have brown hair? I thought he had black hair. It's easily replaceable, but still.<br>Pepper Potts is probably the second most pertinent reason for buying the set. Gwyneth Paltrow gets her first minifigure rendition, and it's a fairly flattering one, but the all-white design for her torso makes her look like a nurse if you're not immediately familiar with the character. She had the long cheerleader hair in a Weasley shade of ginger, which is a nice piece of have.<br>The Mandarin (who was not featured in, or party to, this scene in the movie) is a rather resplendent villain. He's decked out in oriental greens with gold detailing, and a dark green cape that's always a welcome addition. The face is where the LEGO design team fall short; instead of the black Draco hair the Mandarin is wearing, the Sumo Wrestler top-knot would have hewed closer to the movie character, and the beard might have been the style used for LOTR's Gandalf rather than the classic wizard beard design. These things are customisable and easily fixable, but still.<br>The Iron Man Mk.47 armour is rather nice too. It's more balanced between gold and red than previous versions have been, and is featured with a blank white head for appropriate display when you've not got Tony wearing it.<br>The last minifigure included is the Extremis soldier. This zombie-ish dude has a head that is both double printed (scowl and EXTRA-ANGRY SCOWL), and glow in the dark for when it's action time. He's not a remarkable figure, but he looks good glowing on display next to similarly-designed Aldrich Killian. 4/5<br><br>PARTS</div><div>Be warned, this set has stickers. If you can tolerate them like I did, you're left with a lot of nifty tech windows and data readouts that might look good for an Avengers Tower MOC. The set also includes what appears to be Tony's armoured suitcase from Iron Man 2, which is a nice nod to that movie. There's a brick-built blender, as well, and some tools for when Tony needs to feel hands-on. Other than that, there's not a lot else beyond some rare white curved pieces for the ceiling. 3/5<br><br>THE BUILD</div><div>The relatively small set comes with two, yes two, manuals. One covers the unamazing AIM helicopter, which is built (and was perhaps designed) rather quickly, and the other details the building. I say 'building' for want of a better word. This set is called the Malibu Mansion, not the Workshop. Such lost potential - the design if it had been within a better price range might have included something other than windows, floors and a kitchen bench. Given that there are now five or so LEGO versions of the Iron Man armour, one might hope the set allows for storage of all them for the motivated collector. The finished set allows for two, the Marks 6 and 7. MOCing the build might allow for more room. The build is short and sweet, with nothing really standing out. 2/5<br><br>GIMMICKS</div><div>The helicopter comes with the obligatory flick-fire missiles, but these are excused as they're technically part of the scene in the movie. The house has a collapsible window and a flicking mechanism to knock down the Iron Man suits. Nothing too obtrusive, which is nice. 3/5<br><br>CONCLUSION</div><div>The minifigures are nice, but the helicopter is unremarkable and the 'mansion' is lacking. The set looks and feels incomplete. I'd recommend it to the completionist, but if you're looking exclusively for the figures, go to the Internet instead. 12/20</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,3

(Eric Savin) attacking the Malibu Mansion with a helicopter, as Tony Stark falls
out Pepper Potts dons the Mark 42 armour to save Tony Stark. This scene depicts
the main highlight of this movie. The Iron Man 3 logo is displayed in the
bottom right hand corner. The back of the box shows comic book style imagery similar
to all the Lego Super Heroes sets displaying all the play features such as
flick-fire missiles and the exploding features.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">You get two instruction manuals one medium sized one for the
helicopter and one larger one for the mansion, the booklet follows a normal
layout of a Lego instruction booklet and it has small confusion they tell you
to put the sticker with the alert screen on the window but on the outside when
it makes sense for it to be on the inside?<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Parts<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This set contains 364 pieces; this set comes with two rare pieces:

blank white head as it is the display armour, but I feel it should have come
with an New Dark Red colour head instead to match with the colour of the
armour.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Tony Stark is awesome minifigure it comes with one exclusive
piece.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Pepper Potts also a great addition to this set with two exclusive
pieces.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-The Mandarin needed a face with his glasses as well he needed a
new/accurate hair and beard piece. He comes with an inaccurate Lego Alien
Conquest gun and should have been replaced with a better or new gun but does
have very good torso printing, while two pieces are exclusive to this
minifigure.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Extremis Solider (Eric Savin) is a cool minifigure but Lego
should have produced a red glow-in-the-dark head piece for his because they are
not ghosts or white. Also he has the same hair piece as Tony Stark and just
looks like Tony Stark is an Extremis Solider and could of not giving him a hair
piece because he is bold in the movie. This minifigure has two exclusive pieces<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Build and Completed Model<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This set contains three numbered bags: bag one builds the
helicopter, bag two makes the left side of the mansion and bag three make the
right side of the mansion. The build is fairly quick after bag two as big moulds
are used e.g. windows and the roofing. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The helicopter is very slim and could have been a little more
bulky, it doesn’t have any controls, and the missiles should have been able to
dip down then fire rather than stick out all the time. Compared to the of Lego
Super Heroes helicopters: the helicopter in Batwing Battle of Gotham City (6863)
is very creative and this helicopter is very similar to the on in the Wolverine’s
Chopper Showdown (6866).<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The robot (JARVIS) is an excellent touch to this set as it refers
to the first Iron Man movie when the robot tries to extinguish him. He also
holds the Mark 5 (suitcase) armour from Iron Man 2 however you have to put two
stickers on to one suitcase piece which could have been printed.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Malibu Mansion contains a small Bright Yellowish Green kitchen
which has two cupboards and clear mugs as well as a mini build of a juice
blender which is very cool as this refers to Iron Man 2. Left to the kitchen is
the Hall of Armour one is for the Mark 6 and one for the Mark 7, this area has
two screens in the walls to represent Tony’s computer screens in the films
which should have been printed bricks as they looked uneven side-to-side. This area
explodes like in the movie but the Mark 6 area always seems to hit the roof.
This feature is very effective as it encourages you to collect all the Iron Man
armours, the reason there is only two areas of the armours is because Mark 6
and mark 7 are in the Hall of Armour, Mark 42 is always in the middle of is
workshop and the Mark 17 (Heartbreaker) is in the lower part of the mansion.
The third window explodes but I think they should have allowed us to explode all
three windows plus the roof like seen in the trailer. The middle shows a small
area of his workshop with some tools and more computer screens.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The stickers made this set pop but it would be much easier if they
were printed e.g. the stickers for the holograms of the armours always varied
in when applying the stickers as they were not parallel.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Summary<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Overall this set is minifigure driven, so if you want the
exclusive variants like Tony Stark, Pepper Potts and the Extremis Solider (Eric
Savin) then this set is a must buy. This is the best set to get out of all
three of the Iron Man 3 line as it is depicted from such an iconic scene. Lego
could have made this set bigger but they wanted this set targeted to younger
kids and make it easy to get this set as they would have a blast playing with
the set as they have some thing to relate to and react out the scene. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Comparison to the Movie Issue<o:p></o:p></p><p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-15T19:56:03.16Z","You'll Never See Me Coming","<p><strong>Set #76007 Iron Man: Malibu Mansion Attack: </strong>This is one of the better sets out of the Super Heroes Theme for 2013, I think it's safe to say that the best one is Arkham, but this is a top set with some great firsts for LEGO and a terrific build. Read on to find out my thoughts on this set, and possibly where some things could stand improvement. (If any.)</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Box, decent size, decent design, fun features showcased on the set and a great action shot on the front. The instructions are numbered, you have a smaller sized one for the Mandarin's helicopter and a larger one for the Mansion build, no protection, beware damaged instructions or sticker sheets. (This set comes with one.)</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has a lot of great looking parts, the helicopter uses long 1x1 slope pieces for the propellor blades (always useful) and there are a lot of window pieces and curved parts to build something with other than the Model proper. That's about all I can see for the pieces </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set features 5 Mini-Figures, technically, it's pretty clever how you get to have Iron Man and Tony Stark without actually having the two as one Mini-Figure. I also would count the robot assistant as an extra buildable character, similar to the Droids from Star Wars. He's a favorite character from the films too apparently.</p>
<p>First of all we'll start with the awesome looking villain, The Mandarin. This is the fully kitted out version with the dark green cape, and an excellent looking print. He's got a double-sided torso and leg printing and a double-sided facial expression, one neutral the other grinning evilly. He also comes with the Alien Conquest blaster... A repeat accessory and my feelings remain the same, in the context of the Marvel universe I can see this type of weapon being broadly in use. Stick it&nbsp;in the DC world, which I've always linked to the stylized Batman Animated Series and it just doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>Flying the helicopter is another glow-in-the dark headed character, he's kind of bland. The Extremis Soldier has a simple torso print and a glow-in-the dark head as I already noted, I suppose he's serviceable. I think I would have preferred another named villain from the film, the woman scientist perhaps or (even though it would make no sense) Whiplash from Iron Man 2. (Mostly because we probably won't be getting any older Movie sets and I'd kind of like more characters in LEGO form from the films.)</p>
<p>Iron Man Mk 42 is the same as the one found in Extremis Sea Port Battle, so I don't have much to add. The only difference here is that you can put a blank white Mini-Figure head on him to put him in the Hall of Armours. (Even though he doesn't have a spot to actually go.)</p>
<p>Tony Stark is without his armour for the first time, this means he get's a fun new torso showing off the ARC reactor in his chest through the black shirt he has on. Double-sided torso printing, no leg printing and a double-sided facial expression (one side scared the other smirking) how can you not love this Mini-Fig? It's Robert Downy Jr. in LEGO form.</p>
<p>The Robot Character is a fun microbuild that get's to carry the Mk 5 Suitcase around (or serve Tony beverages according to the back of the box), he doesn't count as a Mini-Figure still I'm mentioning him here because he's still a character from the film.</p>
<p>Pepper Potts, Tony's girlfriend. Another first for LEGO, I think she's using a CMF hair piece, but it's in a new light red colour. Her legs are not printed, her torso however is a double-printed white suit and she has two expressions, one frightened the other happy. Her face has freckles which is pretty cool. I want to say it's new, it might not be though, still suits the character quite nicely.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set has three numbered bags, there are two for the Manison itself (numbers 2 and 3 respectively) and one for the Mandarin's Helicopter.</p>
<p>No two helicopter builds are the same, each set with a helicopter from the Super Heroes Theme offers up something new as the build, and while certain steps might seem familiar more often than not they aren't. It's all in one manual, meaning you can finish building the helicopter first or last depending on your mood and quickly have the model to play with.</p>
<p>The Mansion build is pretty impressive, it features one half that is a kitchen area and the Hall of Armours (for this set you only have enough space for two) and then the other side features large open bay windows. This build is fun to make, though I do think it is a bit of a let down when you realize that LEGO has given us four or five different versions of Iron Man's armour, but no place to display them all as part of the Hall of Armour except for the two from the Avengers film sets.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The helicopter is a fun model, it's fun to play with, it's a solid looking vehicle that doesn't easily fall apart and you have four flick-fire missiles. The colour combination is a nice solid looking one, you won't confuse this Helicopter with one from LEGO City that's for sure. There are three stickers for some detail work on the front and the logo on top of the pop off cockpit opening.</p>
<p>The Mansion is (obviously) not to scale, it isn't even a fully enclosed building. What we could have gotten if this were one of the Modulars... Ah well, an AFOL can dream can he not? The set is ok, this particular model has a lot of interesting design elements that make it look fairly impressive even if it is just a chunk of a playset pretending at being a full on Mansion.</p>
<p>For starters the little kitchen area is a fun microbuild, you've got some cupboard space and a nifty looking blender build... That's about it. Honestly I like that LEGO included something like this to make it look nicer than it could have, but I do kind of wish that it was just a bit wider for this area of the build.</p>
<p>The Hall of Armour is more like a nook or alcove of armour honestly, you get some impressive stickers to place on&nbsp;two large windows. These are for the Mark 6 and Mark 7 Armours you got from Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape and Quinjet Aerial Battle in 2012. And you can store them here as part of a display. There is one other armour in the set, LEGO gave us a pair of stickers to put on a LEGO Suitcase element to make the compact Mark 5 as seen in Iron Man 2... Kind of would like to see a full version of this armour for Mini-Figures to wear at some point, though it probably won't happen.</p>
<p>The work area in the central section of the build isn't much, you've got a small tool area with space for Tony to work and then you've got this turnstyle piece that has some free-floating pieces with stickers on them to simulate the hologram monitors that Tony has. An interesting feature, unfortunately I think it's just a tiny bit lacking due to the compact squashed together nature of the mansion's build.</p>
<p>The only other area is just the large open front windows that look out upon the ocean from the bluff where Tony's Mansion is situated. With two play features, an exploding window that pops out with a push of a Technic lever and the Hall(Nook)of Armours also having Technic push action which simulates blowing it up it's an ok model. I think my main problem with this is that Tony's mansion is the equivalent of The Batcave for Bruce Wayne, and where DC Super Heroes gives us a much larger set for The Batcave, Marvel Super Heroes has squashed all of the features into one tiny model. I firmly believe LEGO could have made another Quinjet sized set here spreading out the features so the Hall of Armour and the work station could be much larger and grandeur in design, as it is this model is a bit of a dissapointment when compared to The Batcave.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I still highly recommend this set, the Mini-Figures and the Helicopter are some great elements and while the mansion build has certain design flaws it still works well enough as a set for younger fans to play with and enjoy. As far as AFOLs are concerned, it's a good base to start MOCing up a proper mansion, and comes with all the necessary pieces to actually make a go at working on a better build.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"123MrBrick","2013-06-03T12:43:59.207Z","The best of the Iron Man 3 sets.","<p>I was looking everywhere for this set and I finally found it at ToysRUs but of course, it was ten dollars more. Thanks ToysRUs. The box is large and has the same great quality as other sets available now. Tony Stark is a great minifig, and the chest printing is perfect. Pepper is very inaccurate. In the movie, her hair was shorter and lighter. The Mandarin is different from the other one and I like this one better. The Extremis soldier is kind of boring. The MK 42 armor is the same as the one with the boat. The helicopter has a very sleek design and I really like it, I just wish the missiles could fold up into the sides. The mansion itself has lots of detail, but there were SO many stickers!There is even a place to put the MK 6 and 7, but I just keep the extra MK 42 there. I could play with that exploding feature for hours! I have already made a stopmotion with this set. The only downside is that it is a little small. I mostly wanted this set for Tony Stark, Dum-E, and the mansion itself, but it is still an overall great set. I would reccommend that you get it while you can, even if you are just the slightest fan of Iron Man. I was, until I got the Iron Man 3 sets!</p>
