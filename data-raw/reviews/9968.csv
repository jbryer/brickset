"CapnRex101","2013-04-28T17:54:28.367Z","76002 - Superman Metropolis Showdown","<p>As the&nbsp;smallest&nbsp;of the Superman: Man of Steel sets, I held out little hope for this model before I got it. This feeling was perhaps induced by the rather lacklustre Iron Man 3 set 76008, Iron Man vs. The Mandarin: Ultimate Showdown, which it is difficult to avoid comparing this set to&nbsp;given&nbsp;the&nbsp;similar&nbsp;prices, release dates and themes. However, I have been very pleasantly surprised by this set, as while it is small, one gets a fair amount for their money and two brilliant Minifigures are included.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The new,&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;more compact box which has appeared for all sets at this price point over the last few months makes another appearance here, with some action packed cover artwork. As the car goes flying through the air towards him, Superman is using his heat vision. As usual for titanic encounters such as the one here, General Zod is throwing some scenery at Superman, in this instance the aerial included in the set. In the background one can just about make out the wrecked streets of Metropolis and we have a rather nice image of Superman himself hovering along the top of the box, as well as the Superman: Man of Steel logo in the bottom corner. On the back the features are shown, including the car catapult function and collapsing mast.&nbsp;</p><p>Incredibly for a set this small, two instruction booklets are included, one for the Minifigures and mast section, the other for the small car. I was astonished when I tipped the contents of the box out to find two tiny manuals, but they are without mistakes and I have no problem with there being two instruction booklets rather than one (although it does seem bizarre if you ask me).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection in this set is quite good if you ask me given the size of the set. I find the large girder's very useful for MOCs, and in this set we get one in black which is nice. On top of this we also have nice tan 1x1 'cheese' slopes, as well as some dark tan 1x2 slopes, both of which are great for any kind of rock work one might want to create. Last of all is the rather nice curved windscreen included, which has been around for a while but is far from common, and is useful for just about any car you might wish to create. Overall, not a bad selection in my opinion.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only two Minifigures are included in this set, but in another comparison with set 76008, Iron Man vs. The&nbsp;Mandarin: Ultimate Showdown, they are the main hero and villain from the film. The first of these is of course the Man of Steel himself, <b>Superman</b>. The same Minifigure appears in all three sets, with the lovely 'S' curl hairpiece which we saw on the Superman Minifigure released with the first wave of Super Heroes sets in 2012. His face initially appears to be the same as the original Superman Minifigure too, although it is slightly different with more cheek definition and a serious expression. On the other side of his head is printed red eyes for when Superman is using his heat-vision, along with a particularly fierce mouth with bared teeth. He also wears a red cape, which is just the right shade to represent his cape from the film. The torso piece is printed with a huge amount of detail, including some nice silver highlights and muscle definition on the dark blue suit he is wearing (which is very striking and attractive) both front and back. Of course the famous Superman symbol is also present on his chest, resplendent in dark red and gold. His legs are also dark blue, printed with a continuation of the silver lines on his torso.</p><p>The main&nbsp;villain&nbsp;of the film, <b>General Zod</b>, is also included in the set. Unlike his appearance in the other two Superman: Man of Steel models, this Minifigure does not include his armour and helmet, which is a shame, but the Minifigure looks fantastic even without it. His hair is black, identical to that used on the Bruce Wayne Minifigure from set 6860, The Batcave. I adore this mould and it suits the figure very nicely (although General Zod's hair is much shorter in the film judging by his appearance in the trailers). General Zod's head piece is printed on both sides, with a fairly neutral expression on one, and an angry grimace on the other, along with red eyes, a nice beard and bushy eyebrows. His torso is printed with muscles and sliver highlights much like Superman, as well as having his own symbol on his chest, which looks great against the black of his outfit. The silver printing and muscles are continued on to the back of his torso, along with onto the legs just like on the Superman Minifigure. All in all, a great pair of Minifigures, and it is great to get the two protagonists from the film in one set, so if you are on a tight budget, with only a small set you can get your hands on the two most important Minifigures of all.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Being such a small set, the build is of little interest, and I can find no building techniques of particular note to be honest. It is a very simple build, but certainly an enjoyable one, despite its brevity. Perhaps the manner in which the front and rear bumpers are created on the car&nbsp;using&nbsp;SNOT construction might be new to some younger Lego fans, but with a set as small as this one, I anticipated a fairly simple build, and that is indeed what I got.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the set is complete, it is not particularly substantial, nor does it look fantastic. However, the playability for this set is beyond reproach, and for a young child this would make a great gift in my opinion. The car is nice and durable, so great for play, and the features included on the rubble section (for lack of a better term) are quite entertaining. The first of these is very simple indeed, the mast can be tipped over by pressing down on a grey tile which works very well, and this mast can be held by the Minifigures as an item to throw at their opposition.&nbsp;</p><p>The car also has points where it can be held from, which allow the car to act either as a shield, or another offensive weapon. The second feature is that the car can be flipped using a nicely disguised catapult, which I think is a lot of fun as the car can roll over multiple times if you hit it just right.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>From the perspective of playability, this set is as good as it gets for the price in my opinion. We get the two opposing characters from the film who can fight it out in the midst of all kinds of chaos, with a car flipping over, an aerial collapsing, and plenty of ammunition for each character to throw at the other. No stickers are included which only further the appeal of this set. If you are looking for display potential, I would suggest that set 76009, Superman: Black Zero Escape is your best bet, but if you are buying on a budget, or looking for a nice treat or gift for a child, look no further than this set.</p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-12T11:42:40.08Z","Superman vs. Zod","<p><strong>Set #76002 Superman: Metropolis Showdown: </strong>This is not much of a 'Battle Pack' from LEGO DC Super Heroes, it offers up no unique Mini-Figures, no unique characters and the build is rather bland for what it's worth. Basically this is a pointless set for people who aren't interested in completing a Theme to 100%, or for those who want cheap alternatives to expensive sets for the main characters. Honestly though, compared to 2012 the 15.99$ Super Heroes sets suffer a bit. (DC, Marvel at least has the unique character prints going for them, but we'll get to that when we review Ultimate Showdown for Iron Man 3.)</p>
<p>Here are the pros of this set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheapest way to get Man of Steel Superman and General Zod, two Mini-Figures which have really interesting and detailed prints, both have double-sided torsos, minor leg printing and double-sided faces. (Regular expression and Heat Vision Unleashed expression with red eyes.) 
<li>A solid looking model with a car and a piece of a building or something? I'm not sure what it's meant to be, it looks like one of those airplane warning light towers found on large skyscrapers, which is kind of odd to be built into the ground, although I guess it could be the top of a building they're fighting on. 
<li>Smaller box and the price-per-piece ratio is very nice.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Instruction Manual is split into two books, this is a rather pointless idea for such a small set and much like Razcal's Glider I wonder why LEGO even bothered to print the instructions this way, I hardly think it would save on costs. 
<li>Play feature for flipping the car doesn't work very well due to the weight of the car, it was a nice effort on LEGO's part, just needs a bit of modification to get it to lift the car model up better. 
<li>General Zod doesn't come with his armour, which is accurate to the scene in the movie, however some collectors who want to just have Zod with armour might have preferred getting it here too. 
<li>No extra characters, honestly it would have been nice to have seen Ma Kent, Perry White or any of the other characters we didn't get in Mini-Figure form like Dr. Hamilton who is an important character in the film in a set. Since we'll have to wait for the sequel and then some of those characters aren't around anymore, well it might be asking too much it still would be nice to get at least three Mini-Figures in a set of this size.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I think it's a safe bet that you can skip this set unless you're looking for 100% Theme completion. The build in this set is really not useful, you get a lot of cars in LEGO City sets after all and it'd be easy to attach some handles on those models so that Superman and Zod can lift them. (A nice feature of this model.)</p>
<p>There really aren't any unique pieces in the set or even unique characters, in order to keep this set priced reasonably though it may explain why you only get two Mini-Figures in each set, the licensed sets after all aren't all the same company. Star Wars can get away with four Mini-Figures at 15.99$, other license holders might ask more for the licensing fee which is why the DC sets have traditionally only included 2 Mini-Figures in this price range. (I mean look at Ninja Turtles and Lone Ranger, they have 15.99$ sets that are actually 17.99$)</p>
<p>One funny thing to note though is that the manual shows Zod driving the car, that's actually pretty amusing. Still I mildly recommend this set for completists or collectors who are only interested in owning a Zod and Superman Mini-Fig. Otherwise you can skip it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Jon_Brick","2014-04-25T07:39:18.253Z","A Small but Solid Playset","<p>When it comes to sets that are at a lower price point it is often the case that some&nbsp;have features that can only truly be appreciated once they&#39;ve been built and/or played with personally, while other sets may seem like a good buy but are sorely disappointing once constructed. Thankfully <em>76002: Superman: Metropolis Showdown</em>&nbsp;is a solid build and lands safely in the former field of appreciation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The box is pretty standard size and shape for a set at this price point CA $15.99 (&pound;11.99 / US$12.99 / &euro;14.99) and shows some of the play features along with General&nbsp;Zod&nbsp;throwing a car a Superman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are only a few notable parts which is expected in a small set. The largest and most notable pieces are the antenna tower and dark grey car chassis both of &nbsp;are pieces that is always nice to have more of. There are also four black 1X4 bow plates and two yellow&nbsp;2X4 bow plates used to give the vehicle a sleek appearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;are especially well detailed since they&#39;re from a licensed theme. Superman is &nbsp;in his standard <em>Man of Steel&nbsp;</em>suit composed of a stylized dark red &quot;S&quot; emblem on his front chest along with silver highlights printed on earth blue torso and legs. Zod&#39;s printing is similar to Superman and has identical silver trim on the edges of the torso and legs but the printing is all silver on black torso and legs and the symbol on his chest emblem look like a sideways &quot;U&quot; instead of an &quot;S&quot;.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple with some pretty standard sloped bricks used to form rubble around the antenna tower and there isn&#39;t anything special about the car though it is quite wide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></h3>

<p>The final product while small and simple has features which work together with the figures perfectly when they&#39;re battling each other. The car has some nice sidebars to allow the figures to pick it up, the the rubble has a little seesaw-like apparatus that can be used to flip said car and the antenna tower has a little setup at the bottom that can be used to pop it out or it can simply be picked up by one of the figures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><em>76002: Superman: Metropolis Showdown</em>&nbsp;does very well as a small playset with some basic but entertaining play features which go along well with the figures.</p>
