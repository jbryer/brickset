The Superman: Man of Steel sets however have only recently been seen for the first time, and when images were eventually released they divided opinion. I fell on the side who was quite excited by the appearance of the sets. Unfortunately, they have not entirely lived up to my expectations. The largest of the sets, 76003, Superman: Battle of Smallville, was the one I anticipated the most of all, and while I am not too disappointed with it, it hardly sets me alight with excitement.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box for this set is the average size for a set of this price, and has some rather attractive artwork showing the Kryptonian Black Zero Dropship flying over the apocalyptic streets of Smallville, firing lasers and missiles as it goes. Faora and General Zod are fighting Superman on the ground in the centre of the image and on the left Colonel Hardy is approaching in his military off-road vehicle, while launching missiles at the invaders. A small gallery of the five Minifigures included is found at the bottom of the box cover, and on the back are the usual images showing the various features of the set, including the adjustable wings, launching missiles and storage compartments.</p><p>Two instruction booklets are included, one for constructing the military vehicle and the first two sections of the&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Zero Dropship, and the other for completing General Zod's vehicle. We also get a short comic book, which is nice enough, with some attractive artwork and perhaps some inspiration for younger buyers.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is a decent selection of useful parts in this set, including plenty of dark bluish grey slopes of various shapes and sizes, two dark bluish grey canopies, and one large translucent cockpit cover for the crew compartment. Making up Colonel Hardy's off-road vehicle are also some rather nice tan parts, as well as four lovely wheels which are ideal for just about any off-road vehicle you might wish to create.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting though are the two different sets of armour included for General Zod and his henchwoman Faora! The two&nbsp;differing&nbsp;pieces of chest armour are printed with a huge amount of detail on each, and I will discuss the differences between them a little later in the review. They are also equipped with brand new helmets (which are identical) and even some new pistols, which look very nice indeed, but are perhaps a little too&nbsp;unique&nbsp;to use in anything but science fiction MOCs in my opinion. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Beginning with the main man of the set, <b>Superman</b> is a brand new Minifigure, differing greatly from his only appearance in a set so far, 6862, Superman vs. Power Armour Lex. His hairpiece is identical to the first incarnation of this character, with a highly detailed mould, even capturing his trademark 'S' curl which looks fantastic. The head is printed on both sides, on one is a fairly neutral expression, which differs slightly from the faces used by Loki and Bruce Wayne, and on the other is a much angrier face with red eyes, suggesting he is using his heat vision ability. The cape is nice and simple in plain red, but perfect nevertheless. Superman's torso piece is printed with a huge amount of detail on both the front and back, including plenty of muscular detailing and an accurate dark blue colouration for the entire piece. There are some silver highlights on the design (front and back) as well as, of course, Superman's famous symbol, which is striking in red and gold. Finally, the legs and hips are each printed with a continuation of the silver detailing, which, judging from initial images of Superman from the upcoming film is spot on when it comes to accuracy.</p><p>Also on the side of heroes (I presume from the box artwork, having not seen the film at the time of writing) is the tough-looking <b>Colonel Hardy</b>. Starting at the head, we once again receive the standard smiling male Minifigure head, which has appeared on all kinds of&nbsp;characters&nbsp;in the past, from a&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Guard at Arkham Asylum, to a Russian Soldier fighting against Indiana Jones! I would have preferred a unique head for this character, but this is perfectly satisfactory. The torso will be very attractive to any Modern Warfare MOCers out there as this is perhaps the closest Lego have ever come to producing an accurate torso for modern soldiers. It is printed with loads of pouches and pockets, along with a belt, radio, and some nice olive green highlights on the dark tan component, front and back. His legs are also dark tan and are unfortunately left unprinted. Colonel Hardy is equipped with a single weapon, an Alien Conquest gun. I would agree with the general&nbsp;consensus&nbsp;that this piece has been overused, finding its way into sets where it does not belong, and I think this is another occasion sadly.</p><p>Now, moving on to the&nbsp;villains, we begin with the main antagonist of this Superman: Man of Steel film, <b>General Zod</b>. He can either have his helmet or hair placed on his head, both of which look great on the figure. The hair is the same as that found on the Mandarin Minifigure featured in the Iron Man 3 sets, as well as many others, and I like this mould very much. Alternatively, General Zod can wear his helmet, which is highly detailed with piping and vents moulded in. The black, dark bluish grey and silver colour scheme looks excellent, nor is this component lacking in accuracy judging by the trailers.</p><p>The head piece is certainly very accurate, with a nicely detailed goatee beard, bush eyebrows, and some cheek definition on both sides. The expressions on each side of the head piece differ however, with one having a fairly neutral grimace, and the other, red eyes and an angry expression with bared teeth. His chest and neck armour component is as detailed as the helmet, with similar colours and more piping, all of which looks brilliant. His cape is plain black, matching his torso, which is printed with muscles, silver highlighting and a lovely Kryptonian symbol (which is different on each of the three Kryptonians included in this set, as well as Superman of course). Just like all the other Minifigure sin this set, the torso is also printed on the reverse side. The legs are much like Superman's, printed with some more silver lines, and he carries one of the brand new guns, with plenty of moulded detail.</p><p><b>Faora</b> is similar in appearance to General Zod, but is unique nevertheless and looks fantastic. Just like General Zod, she can either wear a helmet (which is identical to that of her commander) or a lovely hairpiece, which is jet black and is the same mould as that of the Sleepyhead from Series 6 of the Collectable Minifigures. Her face is also printed on both sides, with a smiling expression on one, and a scowl on the reverse. Both sides are decorated with a little bit of dark red lipstick and eyelashes. The chest armour is quite different to that of General Zod, with a fin of some sort on the left shoulder, and a large silver segment of shoulder armour on the other. The chest&nbsp;armour&nbsp;does not stretch down as far as it does on General Zod's armour either, leaving half of her torso printing exposed. The torso printing consists of some feminine curves, along with silver line details and a stylised 'F' on her chest, in the same style as found on Superman and the other Kryptonians. Her legs are identical to those of Tor-An and General Zod with silver printing continued on from the torso. Faora also carries the new pistol piece, so we get a total of two in the set.</p><p>The final Minifigure is <b>Tor-An</b>, another henchman for General Zod. He is not equipped with a helmet or armour, but has only the basic hair originally seen on Mutt Williams in the Indiana Jones theme in dark brown. His face is identical to that of Lex Luthor with a serious expression, and is without printing on the reverse side of the head. His torso is exactly the same as that of General Zod, but it has a stylised 'T' on the chest. I love the personalisation of the three Kryptonian&nbsp;villains, which each have different letters on their chest. The legs too are&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;the same as we see on both General Zod and Faora. As the pilot of the Kryptonian Dropship, Tor-An is unarmed.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build process is fairly simple, with few interesting building techniques. However, I like the way in which the turret is mounted beneath the fuselage of the Dropship using SNOT, and some nicely mounted missile launchers are also featured. Beyond that, it is simple brick stacking, which while a little dull, achieves the look required for the vehicle. A single sticker sheet is found inside the box, with six easily applied stickers, so not too many issues from that aspect of the construction if you dislike decals.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When the construction is complete, this set is in fact quite disappointing in my opinion. I&nbsp;anticipated&nbsp;a densely built and weighty model of the Kryptonian Dropship judging by&nbsp;initial&nbsp;images, however instead we have a fairly weak model, which has plenty of playability (being very swooshable) but lacks detail for me. There are some fun features included though, an opening cockpit, with space for two seated Minifigures inside, and a pair of storage areas for the guns included. Two of the large spring-loaded missiles are also included which is excellent, and they can be launched a good four metres at the right angle. The fins found at the end of each wing are adjustable so that they can be configured&nbsp;however you wish. In the comic book it is suggested that the ship can walk on the tips of these fins, although I cannot balance the model on them without the ship leaning on the gun slung beneath the nose. The bodywork for the model is quite attractive, with some lovely curves and a unique appearance.</p><p>The small military off-road vehicle included is very simple indeed, but it is very durable for play and has a pair of flick-fire missiles (which are inexplicably tipped with blue cones) which only add to the fun, but take away from the&nbsp;aesthetics&nbsp;unfortunately. The seating area of the vehicle is a single piece, which has been around for many years but has not been found in any sets recently that I am aware of. I would have preferred a brick-built central section here, although it looks decent, which is as much as I can really say for this little model as far as display is concerned.</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>This is a set which divided opinion initially, and I am still not quite sure what to make of it. There are some great aspects, like the Minifigures for instance, but also some disappointments, most notably the Kryptonian Judgement which lacks substance and structure, being mostly hollow inside. The cockpit has huge gaps around the edge of the canopy, as do the storage&nbsp;compartments&nbsp;on either side. For play, this set is excellent, with loads of superb functions, but for display the model looks a little unfinished unless you get it from just the right angle, as Lego have done on the box artwork. The models may leave a little to be desired (although they are by no means bad), but the Minifigures go a long way to make up for this, all of whom are highly detailed and look spectacular.</p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2013-06-27T14:15:49.09Z","Big trouble in little Smallville.","Superman is back for another try at a big screen adaptation, and though the movies have never been quite been able to step out of Richard Donner's shadow, that doesn't stop Warner Bros. from bankrolling the Man of Steel's adventures again and again. This time around, however, LEGO has its claws deeply entrenched in the superhero world and shows no signs of letting go, so it's only logical that Mr. Kent finally gets a few more sets thrown his way.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Up until now, LEGO's foray into DC's extensive universe has been severely restricted to ""Batman and Friends"", with Power Armor Lex (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6862-2"">6862</a>) being the only non-Batman-related set thus far. As dubious as the film may be, <i>Man of Steel</i> has granted a boon of no fewer than three Superman sets, with the Battle of Smallville being the flagship one to lead the way. Just think: give it another year and we may finally have a retail Green Lantern in our hands! (But probably not.)</div><div><br></div><div>I should state that I am neither a Superman nor a DC fan, for that matter, but I did find this set attractive as soon as I saw the promotional pictures for it. I guess it was something about the curves that really drew me in, and I was not at all disappointed with either the final look or the playability of the completed model. It's quite ""swooshable"" and packs a punch, and it looks good, too. Pre-teens will love it, and fans of unusual-looking spacecraft will enjoy having it around for display for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>LEGO is usually very picky about its Minifig distribution, but I find that you'll get all that you could possibly need from Battle of Smallville. I thought that the Minifigs were quite generous: you get Superman, of course, the hopelessly bland Colonel Hardy, General Zod, and two minions to torment Superman with. The only other Minifig that one is really missing outside of this set is Lois Lane, and given the plethora of licensed redheads running around (seriously, there must be dozens), I think you'll have little trouble finding a substitute for her if you don't feel like springing for Black Zero Escape (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=76009-1"">76009</a>). I like the darker blue on Superman, though I have to confess I miss his red undies. Colonel Hardy is as uninteresting as his movie counterpart, but he'll do for military aficionados. The ""evil"" Kryptonians, though, are really amazingly done and have incredibly detailed accessories, making them look suitably powerful as well as menacing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There's two builds here: the smaller army jeep and the alien ship itself. Unlike small builds in many other sets, the jeep is actually pretty cool and looks nice in spite of being a very simple construction. It's also generic enough that you'll be able to easily include it in any number of displays, so military nuts are sure to be thrilled by it. Of course, it goes without saying that it has the ubiquitous flick-fire missiles on it - LEGO is never going to get tired of them, is it?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The mothership is just flat-out amazing, in my opinion. I think some may quibble that the use of highly specialised pieces to create the curved effects gives off a suspicious whiff of sets from the late 90's/early 2000's, but when compared against the very organic nature of the movie ships, I think that a good balance was struck. There's plenty of room for all foes to sit around and launch missiles at unsuspecting townspeople, which, by the way, is an enormously satisfying thing to do because this is the first time I've come into possession of the really large spring-loaded contraptions in a set, and it's tons of fun. My only disappointment is that, for some reason, the early parts of the build led me to believe that the mothership can split apart into smaller pods, but this is sadly not the case.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you're looking to get one set from the <i>Man of Steel</i> theme, this should definitely be it. It's got a host of great Minifigs and two excellent builds that complement each other well. The overall look of the Kryptonian ship is very unique, and it's also bound to be tons of fun should be so inclined to play with your toys. And the best part? No lens flares.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-12T15:29:33.923Z","Krypton Attacks!","<p><strong>Set #76003 Superman: Battle of Smallville: </strong>Where the Metropolis Showdown suffers this set is actually quite impressive and features a great number of elements that bring it together to make it a must have set. For one thing this is our first Female Kryptonian in Mini-Figure form.</p>
<p>Naturally LEGO would not include a building of any sort to be destroyed because that's a bit too much for them. However they're perfectly fine with including a military jeep and soldier... Hmmm, I think that's a first for LEGO. Anyway let's proceed with the review and discuss the merits of this set and where I feel it falls a little flat.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>This is another larger set which seperates the instructions into two smaller sized numbered manuals, the size you typically find in 25$ sets. This to me seems like an attempt to avoid mangling or otherwise damaging the much larger manuals that LEGO often used to use in all larger sets. If it works, great and so far none of the manuals have been damaged or unuseable.</p>
<p>The box for this set is standard for DC Super Heroes, it does add the Man of Steel Logo in the right hand corner which is pretty nice.</p>
<p>The included Comic is five or six pages of images showing off the sets in dynamic action, and I do mean dynamic, we get to see all three sets showcased starting with this one and moving through the sets from largest price point to smallest sort of telling you the basic story of the film. The Mini-Fig poster in the back has been changed to add the new sets too, it's fun to see them altogether in one place.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I love those cockpit pieces in this set, and the fun doesn't stop there. This set is my first exposure to the large missile launching pieces that LEGO uses and I like the design of them. They work better with Constraction figures like Hero Factor and Bionicle, still they work ok in the build of the Kryptonian ship.</p>
<p>A lot of decent curved and sloped pieces here too, plus some inverted parts, all around a decent number of useful parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>You get 5 Mini-Figures in this set, two which are in every Man of Steel set and three which are unique to this set. I like the overall look of the Man of Steel Minifigs, their design and print implementation really captures the look of the films quite nicely. The new armor pieces for each Kryptonian look equally impressive, unfortunately there are a few things I question about the various figs in this set.</p>
<p>Superman: We'll start with the main Protagonist, the Man of Steel himself if you will. The print is shared between all three versions of him in all three sets, he has the same darker blue costume with the same double-sided torso print and limited leg printing. (I'm not sure what the leg printing is meant to be from the movie costume, probably just some linework and stuff.) He has the same double-sided facial print and the same red cape. In fact this entire body minus the head and hair piece are also used for poor Jor-El, the bonus Mini-Fig you could have gotten by pre-ordering tickets or something like that. He's a great iconic looking Mini-Fig and great to have from this set or any of the others.</p>
<p>General Zod: Zod is also found in all three sets with the exact same printing, his House symbol on his chest and black costume lend him an air of menace. This version includes a black cape and the Kryptonian armour, great new pieces sculpted by LEGO for the film. And considering they have limited use (meaning we probably won't see them re-used unless they make a few more sets based on the first film when the sequel comes out) they are really impressively detailed.</p>
<p>The one complaint I have with the armour is that they can't wear their normal hair while wearing the armour. This may seem like a minor complaint, however a good chunk of shots in the film had them wearing the shoulder/chest armour without helmets. In LEGO form none of the Kryptonians can add the hair. So you have to&nbsp;take off the armour and helmet then put the hair on, which is really kind of unfortunate. I would have liked, especially to include Faroa's hair with her armour on because she was never without the armour during the climax of the film. Oh well, we can't always have everything perfect.</p>
<p>Faora: This is an awesome character to get in Mini-Figure form, she has a fantastic print and her House Crest is included on her chest. The best part is this is a female character (Super Girl may not be as far behind as we initially thought perhaps?) and a Kryptonian. Her hair piece is re-used from the CMF line, it's the same one that the Sleepyhead had, which replicates her hairstyle fairly close. It's also black.</p>
<p>Tor-An: I think this is the only other Kryptonian character to have lines in the movie, that scientist one who found where the Codex was. He doesn't get the fancy armour that Zod and Faora do, but he is in the same black outfit with his House Crest printed on his chest. All of the Kryptonians have a uniform look, which is great. He also doesn't get a cape, unfortunately. He did have a long cloak in the film, it might have been nice to at least have a cape for him.</p>
<p>There are new accessories for the Kryptonians besides the armour and helmets, they also made new gun pieces that replicate the look of the weapons seen in the film, there are two in this set which you can give to Faora and Zod. (Or Tor-An.)</p>
<p>The last Mini-Figure in this set is still a headscratcher on my part. It's Colonel Hardy: He's a character from the film who was present in the Battle of Smallville and also was around for a lot of the huge action scenes involving Superman and his enemies. And he's a pretty decent Mini-Figure, he's the first army character to appear in a set since the days of Indiana Jones.</p>
<p>His printing detail is good looking like what he wore in the helicopter during the battle in Smallville. My main confusion with this character is why LEGO didn't give him any hair. Honestly the character was not bald in the film, being a soldier he did have a crew cut with shorter hair, but he did still have hair. So when I saw him for the first time I was like, is that Lex or something? And it isn't like they couldn't give him a head piece of some sort, they could have re-used the Army Men on Patrol helmet from Toy Story for him, it'd be nice to see that piece in a tan colour to match his uniform. Anything would be better than having a character who is not meant to be bald, bald in Mini-Figure form.</p>
<p>Hardy does get to share a gun with Commissioner Gordon, they gave him the same Alien Conquest Space gun instead of making a new sculpt weapon for him, which is something LEGO doesn't do. I guess in this universe Luthorcorp makes fancy military grade space guns. (It's fun to use your imagination.)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Sorry&nbsp;I think I took a bit too long with the Mini-Figures. The build in this set is great fun, although it is a bit awkward to complete once you start getting the ship fully assembled.</p>
<p>This is a set with 5 numbered bags, each bag builds a section of the ship except for Bag 1 which builds a military jeep with flick-fire missile launcher and Colonel Hardy and Superman. The build is quite satisfying and the design of the jeep is a good one.</p>
<p>The real trouble with the build for me is once you've built up most of the Kryptonian ship, it becomes quite awkward to pick up and hold while you're adding new bits and sections to it. The ship isn't as easy to pick up while you're building it and even worse once it's finished, but it matches the design seen on camera pretty good.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The jeep in this set works well for what it is, a defensive vehicle that Hardy can use to protect Smallville from the Kryptonians attacking. I think it's funner to play with than the actual ship.</p>
<p>The ship is a monster, you have a really hard time finding a spot to pick it up from so you can swoosh it through the air and if you aren't careful you might hit the missile launching switches shooting the huge rubber tipped missiles when you don't want to.</p>
<p>It has movable wings that use hinge plates to fold out and click joints to rotate into any position you want to simulate the way the ship flew in the film. There are also three cockpits so you can put all three Mini-Figs into the ship and a long Technic piece for a front cannon. And it has stickers for details.</p>
<p>Honestly, I like this model because of how close it is to the design in the film, it's a good display piece. I just think that younger builders will have a tough time actually playing with it because holding it can be a bit tricky.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this is a pretty fair set from the LEGO Super Heroes Theme, the Mini-Figures really help sell it because they all look great. (Even if Hardy shouldn't be bald.) The jeep is fun to play with and can shoot flick-fire missiles at the Kryptonian ship, the ship itself unfortunately is a bit awkward to hold once it's finished and not as much fun to play with/simulate flying for younger fans. It's no Batwing or Star Wars Speeder that's for sure.</p>
<p>I still think this is a set worth picking up though because the pieces are great for MOCs or building a different alien ship if you'd like. I recommend this one folks, it's a decently priced set (especially when on sale) and the contents can be fun.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"samalz","2015-03-01T03:01:41.47Z","Almost cool","<p>Despite some great pieces and minifigs, this set is a disappointment in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some great parts, most notably the opaque gray canopies. The jeep has a big pre-molded piece, which seems a little like cheating to me.</p>

<p>One weird thing (not unique to this set) is that unseen pieces on the inside of the model are totally off the main&nbsp;color scheme of the completed model. This means that in subsequent free-builds, those pieces aren&#39;t as useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Very cool, I&#39;d say, and I&#39;m not a minifig fanatic. The bad guys have a great-looking breast plate&nbsp;and helmet combo. It&#39;s designed very nicely so that the helmet aligns perfectly with the design of the armor. It&#39;s funny that Superman&#39;s hair has the little curlie-que&nbsp;in front. That made me chuckle.</p>

<p>Five minifigs for a set of this size is a lot, I&#39;d say. There&#39;s no way they can all fit in the vehicles at once. 3-4 fit&nbsp;okay.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Okay. Pretty straightforward. One cool technique is how the nose&nbsp;cone attaches with some basic technic pieces. Mentally filed away for my future MOCs!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>About 80% through the build of the main ship, the model looks pretty good. But then... it becomes just weird and awkward. Here are my quibbles:</p>

<p>1. The bottom-mounted gun looks neat and I liked it for its asymmetry, BUT it makes the model totally-off balance. They added, almost as an afterthought, a cylindrical piece on the rear bottom to make the model set level on a table. (It&#39;s piece #4194008, which is pretty rare.) But a one-finger nudge knocks the model over. Not cool. Why not two back pieces to make a stable triangle for the model to rest securely??</p>

<p>2. The wing-thingees&nbsp;on the sides of the model look really awkward and strange. They just don&#39;t fit, visually speaking. <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The assemblies themselves are neat, but where they are affixed is odd.&nbsp;</span>Let me put it this way:&nbsp;if you were building this thing yourself,&nbsp;you&#39;d never put them on like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. The gray canopies on either side look neat, but they have very little playability. A minifig can&#39;t fit, not even lying down. The &quot;gun storage&quot; they show on the box is just silly. They could&#39;ve made these spaces more functional somehow. Kryptonite&nbsp;bomb storage? Jail for Superman? Something.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My&nbsp;six year old son likes the model, but I can tell it&#39;s not as playable as other sets because he loses interest quickly. Lots of cool gray pieces. Great minifigs. The design of the main ship is flawed in several ways and could have been a lot better.&nbsp;I&#39;m not a negative guy AT ALL when it comes to LEGO, but I was a bit disappointed.</p>

"JerdaFoks","2015-11-05T02:14:55.41Z","Mediocre Sources Equal Mediocre Variations","<p>I saw Man of Steel in theaters, I&#39;ll admit it; and I had high hopes a darker tone could deliver a rendition of Superman as a character that I could actually care about. I think everyone had high hopes for Man of Steel, for one reason or another. But the movie, as we all realized, was mediocre at best. But this isn&#39;t a review of the film. Rather, this is a review of a Lego set from the film. And as the title of this review suggests, the set falters just enough to keep me thinking about its errors even after they have slid from view.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the minifigs, because even though I usually purchase a set for the thing it is as opposed to buying for specific minifigs, these ones stood out even on my first pass assembling them. Before jumping to my problem issue with the figs, I do like the Superman one. It&#39;s the first Superman I&#39;ve ever owned so my opinion may not count for much, but I appreciate the film consistency for the chest design as well as the hair piece being unique by incorporating the small bang curl rather than using more standard hair and printing the curl onto the forehead. Again, that my be standard for Superman figs, but I still find it a plus in a set that is in desperate need of them. Perhaps more impressive to me is the number of Kryptonians in the set. Since the attack ship (?) has the ability to hold three minifigs and is clearly intended to do so, it&#39;s nice that there are enough of the right minifigures to give it a full crew. This is less of a problem in higher price point sets, but to see it in the mid-range bracket is an incredibly positive point that is honestly one of the highest good notes in the set overall.</p>

<p>Now for the downsides of the Kryptonians. First off, I feel that it speaks to the film&#39;s mediocrity that I couldn&#39;t remember any of their names off the top of my head (granted, I&#39;m not big on Superman and comic book films are wearing thin on me what with how flat I thought Age of Ultron was, but still). Regardless, the minifigs are fine with a subtly unique head for the main villian&nbsp;(Zod as I discovered) and a very cool hair choice for his lieutenant... That is, they&#39;re fine until we get to the armor. My initial impression of the helmets, chest, and shoulder pieces was that they were all made from a different material due to the insanely intricate (albeit amazing) level of detail. Even if they were, that normally would never bother me since Lego has many times included components not made from the familiar plastic. But for a reason I can only partially explain, even after confirming the armor was made of the usual stuff, the armored Kryptonians look more like Megablocks figs than Lego. I atttribute&nbsp;some of this to how similar the armor is to that in Halo in terms of design, but the rest of the odd vibe from these figs set the build&#39;s tone.</p>

<p>For the ship itself, it&nbsp;<em>looks&nbsp;</em>on model when completed. I emphasize my uncertainty due to it having been some time since seeing the film, only having seen it once, and if memory serves, there never being any real &#39;display&#39; shots for the ship that truly showed it off. The similarity to Covenant design philosophy (Halo universe again for those unaware) with the curves on top and hard edges beneath, carries a stronger association to that world than the one in Man of Steel. Personally, I find the Halo design lean quite enjoyable as a fan of that mythos; however, when watching the film I got no such invocation of similarity when the ships appeared on screen. So despite my personal acceptance of the deviation, I have to dock it on principle as someone who favors Superman to Master Chief would definitely find these vibes frustrating (as if Man of Steel wasn&#39;t enough already).</p>

<p>The construction of the set was on par with the quality and solid design I expect of Lego, at least for the upper portions. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the base of the ship, nor for its rear landing support and gun. I hesitate to call the base flimsy, as that description calls more to mind things like the main wings on the original (&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7259-1/ARC-170-Fighter"">http://brickset.com/sets/7259-1/ARC-170-Fighter</a>&nbsp;) ARC-170 Starfighter. No, the base doesn&#39;t drop in two if touched the wrong way. I think a better term would be &#39;unsupported&#39;. The larger grid squares that form the bottom of the upper part are not attached to the base with enough area. The result is some bend and give in the set during construction until enough of the rest of the model comes together to more evenly distribute build pressure. As much as I like the design of the Kryptonian&nbsp;vessel, my absolute biggest pet peeve with Lego is solid pieces giving way beneath either weight or build pressure. I&#39;ll go further into this with my review of the (&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70146-1/Flying-Phoenix-Fire-Temple"">http://brickset.com/sets/70146-1/Flying-Phoenix-Fire-Temple</a>&nbsp;) Chima set, Flying Phoenix Fire Temple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gun and rear landing strut suffer from a different issue; which is really more an ill-advised piece choice oversight than design flaw. Both use the cylinder component with a 2x2 stud set on one end and the central axle hole on the other. The problem is just that the hole on the cylinder is a hair deeper than half a type-2 length axle which parts use. The end result is a very poor connection from the ship to the strut and the main gun barrel to gun body. Arguably, the weaker strut connection allows snappier removal and addition for better simulation of landing and take-off; but it seems rather inexcusable in the case of the canon.</p>

<p>And finally, a small blurb for the ancillary car before wrapping up this review. Put simply, it&#39;s fantastic. Well, perhaps that&#39;s a bit strong and only appropriate by comparison with the set it&#39;s in. Still, it hits all the right notes from feeling at the right scale to blend well with City vehicles to invoking great call-back design to the cars from Johnny Thunder era Adventure theme sets. The turret also capitalizes on a budget design, being free spinning: getting across a sense of speed and urgency accomplished by an increased number of projectiles or other weapons in sets with turrets as the main focus.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set mirrors Man of Steel to a tee. It has good high points and more than its share of lows, but those lows linger just long enough to keep you from allowing the highs to carry you through satisfied. The ship would seem to have excellent display promise, but the sleek shape hides a lot of its interest from a glance. And as for play, there&#39;s really only one good handling point and even a slip of the fingers will set off the launchers. So despite what likely looks to be a rather scathing review, I can recommend this set with the caveats&nbsp;of a discount (got mine ten dollars off from Amazon) and the buyer being interested more in the ship&#39;s design than its association with Superman.&nbsp;</p>
