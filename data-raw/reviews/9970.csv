"Odeinoichus","2014-01-14T18:25:43.467Z","Extremis Sea Port?","<p><strong>Set #76006 Iron Man: Extremis Sea Port Battle: </strong>Continuing on with the 2013 Super Heroes sets, let's discuss the Iron Man 3 Marvel based sets and what's good about them and what's not so good. LEGO has done a pretty good job adding onto the Avengers sets with new Marvel Movie Properties sets, there are new versions of Iron Man, new villains and some pretty fun play features. Not to mention some interesting design choices, there are however certain things that aren't entirely movie accurate, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Iron Man 3's logo graces the side of the box leaving very little else changed between the overall design of the box between this and the Avengers based sets. The back of the box has changed slightly, using less space for the images showing off the features of the set compared to previous 25$ sets, it's a nice change as it doesn't clutter the box up with empty space. (As some images featured more empty space than actual set images.)</p>
<p>The manual is your standard sized manual for this price range, it includes all of the same details we've come to expected in LEGO manuals, cross-promotions, detailed and easily followed steps for building the models and piece lists.</p>
<p>The new comic adventure for Iron Man 3 shows the story of the film in simplified version, taking certain liberties to showcase all three sets as two of the sets are based more on fanciful ideas and not what actually happened. Like the DC comics they've changed to include images of all the Mini-Figures for both years of Marvel Super Heroes. Also they've made them all the same size, 2012 featured larger (much larger almost comic sized booklets) in the bigger sets, now they're all the same size and the same basic storyline.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This isn't a huge set for parts obviously, there aren't as many rare or interesting pieces in this set. There are however some nice dark green coloured pieces that aren't very common in that colour, also there are some really long 1x1 sloped pieces which I believe were also used for Deadpool's helicopter in 2012.</p>
<p>No printed elements in this set, all sticker details here folks.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>3 Mini-Figures is standard in 25$ LEGO sets, this one features two unique and one less unique Mini-Fig, some really great looking ones too. The Iron Man helmet isn't new, we've seen it in past Avengers sets, some people don't like it all that much. I however love the look of it, the sculpt, the detail and the fact that you can have the character wearing the helmet with the face shield up so you can see their face.</p>
<p>Iron Man is in his Mark 42 armour, the print details are new, this figure is in both this set and the Malibu Mansion Attack. He uses transparent&nbsp;blue studs and cylinders for repuslor blasts from his hands and feet and Tony has a double-sided facial print. (I believe it's the same one from Avengers sets.) The rich level of detail is a really great aspect&nbsp;of this Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>War Machine is only available in this set, he uses the same head seen in the Iron Patriot polybag, he uses red studs and cylinders for repulsor effects and has an all grey/metallic colour scheme with detailed printing. He uses a back bracket for the gun build over one shoulder, this is an awesome Mini-Figure and the first time for the character too.</p>
<p>Aldritch Killian is the main villain of the Iron Man 3 film, his Mini-Figure isn't as&nbsp;impressive as the Mandarin when it comes to villains, still he is an important character from the actual film. To simulate the Extremis effect LEGO has given him a glow-in-the dark head with double-sided facial print. This head is a bit tricky for the hair piece, it's a really tight fit and hard to swap out between the two expressions. Speaking of the hair piece, I believe this is a light brown/red toned version of Bruce Wayne's hair.</p>
<p>Killian has a double-sided torso, again the back is pretty plain on the details, just like Jameson's. He's also using the sci-fi blaster from Alien Conquest... Not accurate to how he fights in the film, I think it'd be better if he'd used LEGO electrical elements in fire colour to simulate blasting Extremis flames from his hands.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The main build of the set is a large speedboat which the comic shows Killian using to escape, this isn't much for a Sea Port named set. The scene in the film was fought on a large cargo ship and I don't remember any speedboats being around at all. But I suppose to make this set at this price point and without spoiling the film LEGO had to take some liberties.</p>
<p>The build is a nice solid looking model, fuller and more detailed than the boat found in the Stealth Shell set for Ninja Turtles and&nbsp;just as impressive. Then there's the small Buoy build, this has a play feature, sticker details and doesn't use more than 10-12 parts if memory serves. It's a nice set piece for the boat, but the main model is the better build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>With hidden flick-fire missiles, a nice dark green and black colour scheme and a fun playable boat (that doesn't float) it's a good model. It's not movie accurate, and the name of the set implies that this is meant to be some kind of big Sea Port battle, but really it's more like a Speedboat battle.</p>
<p>There's a hidden compartment with a stick of dynamite as well, other than that not much else in the way of play features. I feel that the model works for what LEGO is trying to do here, make a fun and engaging action set for the younger fans while still giving us some great Mini-Figures for us older collectors.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set for the Mini-Figures and the model, it's a nice combination of decent model, decent price point and decent selection of Mini-Figures. Even though Killian is a bit of a weaker draw compared to Iron Man Mk42 and War Machine. It is nowhere near movie accurate as far as what actually happens, and that's ok, you wouldn't want to spoil the ultimate climax of the film by buying a LEGO set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2013-07-02T09:51:02.77Z","Take her to sea, Mr. Stark. ","Okay. Hmm. This set. I have somewhat ambivalent feelings about this set, feelings that really have little to do with the fact that it really has almost nothing to do with the <i>Iron Man 3</i> film. The Minifigs are superb - there's no doubt about that. But that boat? (And that buoy?) On some days, it seems cool, and on other days, it seems like a frightful abomination. I'm really not sure.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I am a Marvel fan, and I am very happy that War Machine has a Minifig incarnation, and honestly, although it annoys me tremendously that the only way (as of typing this review) to get the infamous Iron Patriot is by pre-ordering a video game from a specific chain of stores, I'm glad that the ""classic"" War Machine armour was included here as opposed to the movie one. It looks absolutely fantastic, and the machine gun attachment is so simple but so elegant and conveys exactly that <a href=""http://images.wikia.com/marveldatabase/images/3/31/Iron_Man_2.0_Vol_1_1_Textless.jpg"">iconic look</a> without resorting to the use of special pieces. Really nicely done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>LEGO Guy Pearce aka Aldritch Killian is a pretty sweet addition, and yes, the glowing head is a little weird, but not enough to be distracting, I don't think. The reverse head is Guy Pearce all doped up on Extremis, and it's kind of scary, actually. In any case, I feel like there's a paucity of LEGO Marvel villains, so having him around is nice. The gun, however, is completely unnecessary. The man breathes fire.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Iron Man is, well, Iron Man. His armour is unique to this set, I think? I'm not sure. At any rate, the torso prints are certainly very different from those in the first wave of Marvel sets, so even if you already have Mr. Stark, you won't be sorry to get a different set of armour. I don't really like the pearl-gold hands, though, so I swapped them out for dark red ones and I think he looks much better, but I'll leave that up to you. Either way, it's very detailed and very cool.</div><div><br></div><div>And now the boat. Oh, this boat. Honestly, I want to like it. There's a lot to play with here - a removable hood (do boats have hoods?), a cool flick-fire missile contraption that sets it apart from the usual flick-fire gimmick, and a sleek look overall. Yet, there are bits about it that just don't seem right: the curvy piece at the front is forced to protrude slightly, the HUGE empty space that's designed for only one Minifig (Killian), and that colour scheme - dark green? Why? Because of the Mandarin? Look, disregarding the movie and remaining within the context of the LEGO sets, there is nothing to suggest that the boat belongs to anyone other than Killian. And if it's just meant to be a souped-up speedboat, keep it white or something. Dark green is just not right. The stickers are not necessary. And the buoy...it's a buoy. I guess it'll look good if you have some of the other City <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Harbour"">harbour</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Coast%20Guard"">coast guard</a> sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You're going to want this set for the Minifigs - that much I can guarantee. Maybe I'm being harsh on the boat, but it just seems like a wasted opportunity somehow. Find this set on discount if you can, and I think the awesomeness of the Minifigs will supersede the somewhat lackluster build, at least in my opinion.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,3
"123MrBrick","2013-05-14T21:12:51.853Z","Great Set.","<p>LEGO set 76006-1 is a truly amazing masterpiece. I would recommend it to any fan of LEGO. The box is of high quality and the back of the box shows all of the features of the set. The front shows all of the sets components in a fantasy situation. On to the minifigures. I will start with Iron Man. The variant included in this set is the Mark 42 emergency use armor, which is also featured in the Malibu Mansion Attack. The mask can be lifted up to reveal Tony Stark's double-sided head; one side scared, the other determined. The helmet itself is the same as the one featured on Iron Man in the early Avengers sets. The body is crimson red with gold plating on both the front and back. The front also features Iron Man's iconic Arc Reactor. The legs are also crimson red with gold plating. The hips even feature printing! To add the appearance that Iron Man is flying, two turquoise transparent studs are in his hands and on his feet. It is my favorite of the three included minifigures. Next up is War Machine. His helmet is the same as Iron Man's, but in gray and silver. Underneath the helmet is Rhodes' face, which is also double-sided. One side is frowning, while the other is mad. War Machine differs from Iron Man because he has a shoulder cannon as an extra weapon. It looks fairly similar to its appearance in the movies, and it is made with four bricks. War Machine's body is similar to Iron Man's, but it is gray and silver. Printing is on both the front and the back. The legs and the hips also both feature printing. It is an overall great minifigure. Last we have Aldrich Killian. He is a minion of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. He has a special ginger hair piece only seen on a few other minifigures. His face is double-sided as well, one side normal, the other his evil Extremis face. His torso is a tan business suit with matching pants. He carries a gray gun also featured in the Galaxy Squad theme. He also has a stick of dynamite. His head can glow in the dark. Now, for the set itself. I will start with the buoy because it is smaller than the speedboat. The buoy has a blue base to make it look like it is on water. Two stickers, which both read JC82 must be applied to the buoy itself which is red. It also has an exploding feature when you push down on the gray four by two. Even though it is small, it adds a lot of playability to the set. On to the speedboat, the main part of the set. The boat was much larger than what I first expected. It is mainly green, black, and yellow. You can fit one minifigure in the furnished cockpit, or you can hide one in the secret compartment in the hull. The stickers on the boat are two missile launchers and the Ten Rings insignia. The boat can also fire twin flick missiles by the pull of a lever which is a MAJOR improvement from previous sets. It is a very fun boat to play with. This set also features a small comic which basically gives away the plot of the movie. The price to piece ratio is almost perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>Complaints:</p><p>1. Aldrich Killian's head is green, while his hands are flesh tone. This looks odd.</p><p>2. Why was War Machine included in this set if he is not even in the movie? It should have been Iron Patriot while War Machine was the preorder exclusive.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an overall great set. 15/10. Love It. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Berrus_Brickus","2014-04-14T23:31:59.93Z","And now, the negative review","<p>This is the mid-priced set from the <i>Iron Man 3</i> range featuring, surprise, Iron Man (whose variation also appears in the larger 76007 Malibu Mansion Attack) plus his sidekick War Machine and his wannabe of the week, Aldrich Killian, both exclusive to this set, as they race across the water for...I have no idea what. The <i>Iron Man 3</i> sets are really a big question mark. The largest one, based on the iconic cliff-side mansion attack, is clearly from the movie. The other two, not so much. I guess that Tony and Rhodey <i>were</i> in a speedboat at one point, but it didn&#39;t quite resemble this. But that&#39;s okay, the movie really didn&#39;t offer much else to make sets on. But then, the movie didn&#39;t have much substance which a movie should have been based on....</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""The_Box_and_Contents"">The Box and Contents</span></strong></h3>

<p>I usually like artwork featuring water and sunsets, which would look great with the red coloring that Marvel boxes have, but the green boat is in such a stark contrast (pun unintended) to the reds and oranges that it&#39;s striking, but also rather ugly. The cartoon image of Iron Man in the corner is cool, and I really like the ink splash and city border that the Super Heroes sets had in 2013.</p>

<p>There are two bags, a comic book, an instruction manual, and sticker sheet stuffed (perhaps &quot;stuffed&quot; isn&#39;t too accurate) inside.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""The_Build"">The Build</span></strong></h3>

<p>The build starts with the boat, which makes up a majority, as I&#39;m sure you can imagine. There is a pause when the frame is completed to move onto bag two. The build is very simple, and there are no surprises at all. Other than a little TECHNIC mechanism in the back for some flick-fire missiles, it is all bricklaying and feels really drawn out. While this could be good for a casual fan just looking for a souvenir from the movie, this set not actually looking like anything in the movie probably would work against that decision.</p>

<p>The buoy is at the end of the build, which is sort of strange because these sort of things seem to come first as a &quot;warmup&quot;. Like the speedboat, there is nothing notable about the build, but it&#39;s more forgivable because it is so small.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Parts"">Parts</span></strong></h3>

<p>Minifigures will come later, but aside from them, there really aren&#39;t that many notable parts. The most obvious is the bow which is exclusive in dark green. It&#39;s not particularly useful, but if you are looking for it, this is the only place for it. Otherwise, there are a couple of dark green slopes, four long black bows, but the only other pieces that are particularly rare are a pair of inverted angled slopes in dark gray (which only appear in one other set) and a pair of odd shell/armor bricks in light gray (also only appearing in one other set).</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t really recommend this one for the pieces, unless you <i>really</i> need that dark green bow.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Final_Model"">Final Model</span></strong></h3>

<p>The boat has a good shape. It&#39;s really oversized though. The only play feature it has is a couple of flick-fire missiles which can be launched by a lever in the back. This is actually a good integration of flick-fires I think, so that&#39;s okay. Actually, the boat looks <i>just</i> okay. Dark green, black, and yellow isn&#39;t a bad colorscheme, but it isn&#39;t particularly striking or interesting.</p>

<p>LEGO also seems to be trying to pass off the cavity under the bow as a play feature, since images show Aldrich hiding there. The instructions say to place a stick of dynamite inside. I guess that domestic terrorists are having budget cuts?</p>

<p>There really isn&#39;t anything to say about the buoy. It &quot;explodes,&quot; but so would most LEGO sets if you drop them.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Minifigures"">Minifigures</span></strong></h3>

<p>As already mentioned, this set includes Iron Man in his Mark 42 armor, War Machine, and Aldrich Killian.</p>

<p>Iron Man&#39;s armor is based on the one he wears in the movie and is also included in 76007, but this set costs less. Mentioning that it is movie based might seem like an obvious thing to point out to someone who hasn&#39;t seen it, but if you have, then you&#39;ll know it&#39;s almost stranger to see something accurate in these sets. Anyway, I&#39;m not a fan of the minifigure itself. The Mark 42 itself is less stylish than the Marks 6 and 7, but even then printing a mostly gold suit on a mostly red body comes off looking <i>really</i> cheap. The way which the bobblehead helmet opens is cool and the helmet looks better in real life than in images, but I still think that including the armor pieces from the old Hockey sets would have helped to offset the strange proportions and made the figure look better.</p>

<p>War Machine kinda sorta didn&#39;t really appear in the movie. The man inside of the suit, Iron Man&#39;s friend Rhodey, did, but he had adopted the Iron Patriot armor because Captain America wasn&#39;t interesting enough to play Mr. Propaganda in today&#39;s world. Still, despite basically being an Iron Man recolor, War Machine is a nicer figure than the Mark 42 and I would personally rather have it than Iron Patriot (who was available with the pre-order with <i>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</i>, for anyone wondering). The face is useful, since dark skinned heads are rare, especially in sets of this size (and when they are included, their use is limited by eye-patches, right Director Fury?). All-in-all, War Machine is a pretty cool minifigure and I&#39;d say that he is the only worthwhile reason to get this set.</p>

<p>And then there is Aldrich Killian who is overshadowed by the heroes of the set, and rightfully so I&#39;d say. He&#39;s a weird figure, his character in the movie was rather poorly executed, in my opinion, and he is such a minor character in the comics that he really doesn&#39;t have much going for him. His hairpiece is useful, having previously been included with Hawkeye, but makes more sense here. The torso is also exclusive, pretty versatile, and he actually wore it in the movie. The glow in the dark head is really useless and doesn&#39;t even make sense in the movie&#39;s context. The men and women infected with Extremis did light up, but it was orange/red, not green. Not to mention, it looks like a mess with the blond eyebrows and flesh hands. It just doesn&#39;t mesh well, and isn&#39;t how I&#39;d design these characters, but I suppose there is a reason for that....</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Conclusion"">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>

<p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t like <i>Iron Man 3</i> (for reasons unrelated to the Mandarin), but this set is nothing like the movie and-<big><big>PLOT TWIST</big></big>-I still don&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>The boat is stylish, but is a really boring build and very oversized for a speedboat. I&#39;m not a big fan of 2/3 of the minifigures, either. War Machine is the only thing about this set that I actually like, though fans of the movie will probably want the main antagonist too. 76007 Malibu Mansion attack really seems like a much better value, with more recognizable and better minifigures, scenes, and a nicer build. Of course that set also costs twice as much, but the speedboat really is undesirable, a waste of money for anyone but a completionist, and Killian is only for <i>big</i> fans of the movie....</p>

<p>My rating may seem harsh especially since the set itself might not be <i>that</i> bad, but really, I feel that it is just filler which is not worth the money.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-03-22T21:22:27.12Z","Sink or Swim?","<p>In the years since the 2013 release of sets based on&nbsp;<em>Iron Man 3</em>, Lego fans frequently tease the line for its inaccuracies and issues. While I have enjoyed all of Marvel&#39;s films; this set does leave much to be desired.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the dark green color Lego uses; and getting them as pieces in this set is fun. However it is not a particularly rare color. The boat/airplane pieces used to assemble the model will are more desirable, yet not particularly rare either.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As with a lot of Marvel Superhero sets; the minifigures are the meat and potatoes of the set; two of the figures are among the favorites in my collection although one of them leaves a lot to be desired.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iron Man Mark 42 Armor</strong>, this suit of armor was the main suit used by Tony Stark through out the film. In the film the armor was an experimental prototype, prone to failure; and an attitude of its own. The Lego version is equally interesting, only being found in this set and set 76007 Malibu Mansion Attack. The Mark 42 armor has a unique head print for Tony Stark; one side showing a wide smile and the other an expression of fear or shock.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>War Machine Mark 2 Armor</strong>, exclusive to this set is the armor used by James Rhodes in...&nbsp;<em>The Avengers Age of Ultron.</em>&nbsp;Yes, this armor when seen in the film&nbsp;<em>Iron Man 3</em>, sported a red-white-blue paint job that made it into the Iron Patriot Armor; and it would be a full two years before it appeared on the silver screen in War Machine&#39;s traditional metallic colors. While it would have been nice to have received the Iron Patriot Armor in a retail set (The exclusive polybag&nbsp;30168 costs an arm and a leg on Bricklink), I would argue that War Machine is a far more versatile figure. The figure is molded in a dark bley plastic, a choice that has irked a lot of FOL&#39;s (the new War Machine that has been released in 2016 comes in black plastic). However, Rhode&#39;s armor is well printed and detailed and looks spectacular next to Tony&#39;s armor sets.</p>

<p><strong>Aldrich Killian</strong>, the main villain of the film is my least favorite figure in this set. Why? His head was molded in glow in the dark plastic. This is highly detrimental to the figure&#39;s appearance. I feel that Lego should avoid using glow in the dark material for licensed figures; as the minifigure has very little resemblance to the actor on screen. (the 2001 figure for Severus Snape in the Harry Potter sets suffered the same effect). Fortunately this being Lego, a head swap is easy to perform. I have at times swapped the glowing head with the normal flesh head of Harry Osborn from the 2004 set 4857; and have found this greatly enhances the appearance of the figure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>So there is really nothing surprising about the build, it is just a quick boat that comes together and that is pretty much it. There will be no surprises to seasoned Lego builders.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So the final model is rather; plain in my opinion. Sure it looks like a boat, but it doesn&#39;t do much other than offer a place for minifigures to stand and a few flick fire missiles. The lack of a astonishing model is further hampered by the fact that this boat isn&#39;t really in the movie. Yes there is a speed boat in the film, but it is a normal recreational model and not some sort of tricked out attack boat. To complicate the issue even more; Killian is not manning the boat in the film, it is actually Tony and Rhodes in plain clothes; with Tony using some fancy glasses to remotely pilot his suit.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I will admire this set for giving me two of my favorite minifigures; Iron Man Mark 42 and War Machine Mark 2. However; there really isn&#39;t anything else noteworthy in this set. The boat is currently &quot;deadlined&quot; in an increasing pile of &quot;Marvel Vehicles and Things,&quot; a pile of models that includes Ultron&#39;s glider thing, the three sided Hulk trap,&nbsp;and the Mandarian&#39;&#39;s flaming Golf Cart. It is one of the sad realities that the Marvel Superhero line has offered so many vehicles and small builds it is getting hard to give them each a purpose. My Iron Man and War Machine figures from this set are more fun with modular buildings than they are with the boat they were packaged with... Yet I can also see how this &quot;vehicle&quot; approach is a good thing for the Marvel line, as these small sets offer a good price point for children and families; it just gets annoying for the serious collector who begins to amass a fleet of odd vehicle sets.&nbsp;Furthermore the parts in the set don&#39;t offer much to build MOC&#39;s with. Although I am glad to own this set, I feel like giving it a two star rating as it lacks any substance to it.</p>
