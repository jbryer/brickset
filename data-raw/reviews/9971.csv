I build the three Iron Man 3 sets 2 weeks ago, I was waiting to see the related movie to post a review of these sets and I did see it last night so here I am, reviewing.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigs 4/5</b></div><div>The Heartbreaker armor, the mark 15, is really the only reason you would buy this set, it's really well done. It has a different visor as the past armors, the torso and back details make it accurate to the real armor.</div><div>You get a Mandarin, he's okay althought I think the cape version from [76007 Malibu Mansion Attack] is better looking.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Building Experience 4/5</b></div><div>Really not much to say on such a small set concerning the building experience. It's a simply designed vehicle.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall 2/5</b></div><div>You're going to say 2 is a low rating but honestly, I gave it a 2 out of 5 only because of the Heartbreaker armor. Now, if you haven't seen the movie, you're only going to say that this set doesn't deserve the name ""Ultimate Showdown"" beacause it's really small. If you saw the movie like me, you're going to say ""What is this set? Where's this coming from?"" because this set makes no sense at all, it doesn't represent anything from the movie (See spoiler below for more details).</div><div><br></div><div>/// <i>Spoiler</i> ///</div><div>1) I paid a lot of attention to the movie and I can say this: Stark never wears the Heartbreaker armor, it only appears at the end along with all the other armors that are remotely controlled by Jarvis.</div><div>2) According to wikipedia, the Mandarin is the arch-enemy of Iron Man. In the movie, the Mandarin is just a character created by Aldrich Killian and played by a junky. So if this set is meant to be the final battle, it should be Stark against Killian.</div><div>3) This vehicle simply never appears in the movie.</div>",TRUE,2,4,4,4,4
"123MrBrick","2013-05-25T10:30:39.12Z","Great set, very inaccurate.","<p>I just got this set yesterday for my birthday and I decided to build it right away. The box was of high quality like most of the 2013 LEGO sets, and the instructions are small but easy to follow. There are two minifigures: the Heartbreaker Iron Man and the Mandarin, which is different from the one in the Malibu Mansion attack. The Mandarin has great face and body printing, which are both new, but sadly the legs are blank. The Heartbreaker Iron Man looks great, and the helmet is a different mold. The face is also different from the one in the other two sets. The buggy itself has a few parts I had never seen before, and shoots twin flick fire missiles. This is the only Ten Rings vehicle without their insignia. It is an overall great set, but I wanted it mostly for the Heartbreaker.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Complaints:</div>

<div>1. Tony Stark never actually wears the Heartbreaker in the movie.</div>

<div>2. This buggy is not in the movie.</div>

<div>3. The Mandarin was not real. He was just a character created by Aldrich Killian. If anyone should be in the &#39;Final Battle&#39; it should be him.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>8/10, Mostly for the inaccuracy.</div>

Not really.","<p><strong>Set #76008 Iron Man vs. The Mandarin: Ultimate Showdown: </strong>When it comes to the smaller price range sets&nbsp;I think 2012 had a better overall selection compared to 2013, with the DC side of things we got a bland buildable car and fall-apart antenna thing and two Mini-Figures found in all three Man of Steel sets. With this one, while the Mini-Figures are more unique, the build is still quite unusual and not even accurate to the film that LEGO is trying to use as a cross promotion.</p>
<p>Granted the sets were okayed and meant to be for younger fans, on top of that they didn't want to spoil the storyline of the film and if these were just generic Iron Man sets I wouldn't really have a problem with this one too much. Unfortunately when you tie something in to a film you eventually want to see some of what we saw on screen actually available in LEGO form, sad to say only the Mansion set is even close to something from the movie while the other two are more like embellishments.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unique Mandarin Mini-Figure with bare-arms, and no cape. This is a pro mostly because this version of the Mandarin truly looks like he's ready to go toe-to-toe with Iron Man, even without the goofy looking vehicle. 
<li>Heartbreaker Iron Man Armour is new and unique to this set. Adds more armour for your collection and is a great deal compared to the DC set. 
<li>The build is a solid looking little vehicle and I do believe it appears in the LEGO Marvel Game, not 100% sure on that as I haven't been able to play it yet. Still the vehicle is an improvement over the DC set, though honestly not by much.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The vehicle is just a goofy looking thing that you'd expect to see in cartoons or comic books, not the actual films that Marvel has produced. Also the flame shooting gadget on the top is a bit too short and doesn't aim very well for hitting Mini-Figs with the flick-fire missiles. 
<li>Flick-Fire Missiles, a minor complaint, I just hate the placement of them in this build. I think if Mandarin was using a slightly different type of vehicle, which actually flies so he can keep up with Iron Man the missiles would work better. Especially if they were on or under the wings. 
<li>Nowhere close to accurate to the film.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this set is worth picking up if only for the Mini-Figures. I find the vehicle to be a bit too outlandish compared to some of the other stuff we've gotten in much better Marvel based sets. It's complete fabrication, as in not in the actual movie, is a real blow to it because personally I would have much preferred to see a huge Cargo Docking area with cranes and things as The Ultimate Showdown, especially if more armours had been included.</p>
<p>I still recommend this for younger fans, it's actually a fun little set to play with. I just think the older fans would prefer just to get the Mini-Figures, so they might go to Bricklink or other sites and buy them that way instead of picking up the set. Ok set, just not necessary if you aren't completing the Theme.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3

suit while battling the Mandarin with his buggy. It’s clearly indicated that
this is a final battle at a cargo bay. The Iron Man 3 logo is displayed in the bottom
right hand corner. The back of the box shows comic book style imagery similar
to all the Lego Super Heroes sets displaying all the play features such as flick-fire
missiles and the rotating flamethrower cannons well as lifting up the visor on
the Iron Man minifigure.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">You get a small instruction booklet however it comes bent; the
booklet follows a normal layout of a Lego instruction booklet and it has no
mistakes.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Parts<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This set contains 91 pieces, this set comes with two rare pieces: <span style=""background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">Roof Front 6X4X1</span> which only

Three pieces are exclusive to this minifigure.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-The Mandarin needed a face with his glasses as well he needed a
new/accurate hair and beard piece. He comes with an inaccurate Lego Alien

have very good torso printing, while two pieces are exclusive to this
minifigure.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Build and Completed Model<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This set contains two bags which are not numbered with a very
simple build of a buggy. The buggy has lame inaccurate Lego City wheels but this
set has play features which make this set good for younger kids.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Summary<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Overall this set is minifigure driven, so if you want the exclusive
variant like Iron Man and the Mandarin the this set is a must buy. This is
currently the cheapest way to get an Iron Man minifigure in retail stores (not
including polybags) this set should have retailed between £8-10 instead of £12.
This set is clearly not an ultimate showdown but the minifigures are the
highlight of the set.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Comparison to the Movie Issue<o:p></o:p></p><p>
