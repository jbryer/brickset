Hey guys. :) </p><p>Today I'll be reviewing this set, one I have a hate/love relationship with. </p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>This is a really cool set, great value for $20!</li><li>The minifigures are really detailed. Superman looks exactly like Henry Cavill (sans the red boots) and Zod has really cool armor. Lois is a cool figure as well. </li><li>This set has lots of play features, such as the movable ladder platform, the (flickless?) flick fire missiles, the adjustable computer screen, the sliding door, the opening cockpit on the escape pod, the adjustable chair,&nbsp;and the adjustable rockets on the pod. Very cool indeed. </li><li>The sliding door is a really cool build!

It can't even sit on the ladder platform! </li><li>The lights on the ladder platform aren't symmetrical. Also, I think there should have been an extra sliding door. Which brings me to my next problem: </li><li>Why put in a sliding door if there's nothing there anyways?!? </li><li>The platform with sliding door and flick missiles looks way too much like a separate ship itself, and also, isn't even in the movie! </li><li>The rockets in the back look really ugly and unnecessary. Like seriously.</li><li>Lois Lane looks like Black Widow in a different outfit. Come on! </li><li>On the escape pod there are pieces that are useless since they get covered up anyways! You could have saved this set 10 pieces! </li><li>Seriously, whatever happened to symmetry in LEGO sets? </li><li>The glass window on the pod has a very awkward shape. </li><li>When you try to fire the flick missiles, you have to hold the set down. Otherwise, the entire thing falls over.</li><li>There's a piece that sticks out awkwardly in the back. </li></ul><p>So as you can see, I'm kind of on the fence with this set. I was really excited by it before but now I'm thinking it's just OK. I think you guys should just wait till it goes on sale or something. You can decide for yourself.

"_add_um","2013-12-15T23:09:11.333Z","Underwhelming Super Heroes Set","<p>Black Zero Escape is one of the three DC Super Heroes sets based off the new Superman movie:&nbsp;<i>Man of Steel</i>. &nbsp;How does it turn out? Well, it's a mixed bag..&nbsp;<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Like the 2012 DC Super Heroes box the box art remains mostly the same. The logo in the corner of course is the movie logo. What surprises me is the fact lego is still using the older DC logo when a newer has been introduced a while back (though it does appear on the side of box in the small print). It won't be until 2014 when they finally use it on the front of the box. The instructions are as expected all I can say is the use of orange inside the instructions looks odd. A comic is included but unlike 2012 sets where a unique comic appeared in each set, the 2013 set comics are identical to the theme in this case the comic appears in all Superman sets. The comics are very weak and don't offer much, but I do like the way it shows all the minifigures at the back.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>In terms of interesting parts, we get a few noteworthy additions. Zod's kyptonian armour is very well done. Two alien conquest pistols appear in this set (most Super Heroes set do) but thankfully they aren't accessories for a figure. Zod also gets a gun in a brand new mold and I hope this piece carries on because it's a lot better than the alien conquest guns. There's a nice grey wall piece that can be useful. In fact most of the big pieces are handy if you're into collecting parts. Overall though there's not a lot of pieces gone into making this set and leaves this set very plain.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Despite two of the minifigures appearing in all Man of Steel sets, the figs are brilliant and honestly it is 99% of the reason people will buy this set. The figures included are Superman in his Man of Steel outfit, General Zod with battle armour and Lois Lane; all with double sided heads. Firstly Superman is fantastic, I love the use of dark blue instead of the light blue used for the comic Superman (set 6862). The doubled sided head is great, one side is the stern face and other one has Superman in a rage while using heat vision. His eyes are red and it looks really threatening. It should be noted while the stern face looks the same as the comic Superman's face they actually are different. The hair piece has been used on the other Superman and again here it looks awesome but it is inaccurate as Henry Cavill's Superman doesn't have the lick of hair on the forehead. Zod similarly comes with his ""normal"" gruff face and his heat vision face, the expression is mostly the same as Superman. What sets this one apart from 76001 is this Zod comes with a cape, battle armour and a gun. The amour is amazing and there's so much detail in it. The use of multiple colours for the armour is very welcome. The only negative thing I can say is the hair piece can't be put on while the chest piece is on too. Finally Lois Lane is very well done too but I don't think the face looks like Amy Adams and the cheekbones just look off on her. Other than that these figures are great, all include back printing and a lot of detail. I like how Zod's and Superman's outfits have the same basic design with the belts and their own unique kryptonian family crests, due to their common origin.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was fairly straight forward and quick. It only took about 15 to 20 minutes to complete. While I prefer not to have sticker I think the set would look too plain without them, it's already plain as it is. Most of the work is spent making the pod. Not very exciting.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once completed you'll how underwhelming the set really is. The launch pad/artillery missile don't even look like it's a section of a ship (called the Black Zero), it's too vague looking. I do like how you fire the flick fire missiles by pulling back the tab&nbsp;&nbsp;and releasing it (which can be done because of the rubber pieces). And the sliding door is a nice inclusion. But the ladder part it just stupid I assume it's for placing the pod on but doesn't fit on it properly all it does is just awkwardly stand on it. The escape pod itself is very well done, I like how you can move the seat. Not much else can be said. It's okay.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall fantastic minifigures but the model is just hit and miss, mostly being miss. The price however isn't extremely steep and it's worth it for the figures. As a Super Heros fan I recommend it for Lois Lane and Zod's extra parts provided you don't want 76003, as a casual lego fan stay away from it. It's just acceptable as a set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"Hobie819","2016-12-24T03:06:40.23Z","Not a standout, but the playability is good for kids","<p>All in all, the set wasn&#39;t a bad set. As a disclaimer, I have not seen this Superman movie.. even 3-4 years later so I can&#39;t compare it to the movie in terms of realism, etc...</p>

<p><strong>Box and Contents: </strong></p>

<p>This review was done 3 years after we purchased the set, so I no longer remember the packaging for the set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The parts themselves aren&#39;t anything spectacular. It&#39;s a very grey set, with most parts being either dark grey or light grey.Theer are a few other colors here or there but no special pieces.</p>

<p>The minifigures are where the good parts come into play for me and my children. Superman is a pretty good representation of superman. Everything about it is classic superman. The torso even has printing on it. Louis is mediocre, but the bad guy (General Zod I presume based&nbsp;on&nbsp; the brickset description)&nbsp;is pretty nice indeed. The amount of things that come with him are comparable, or even exceeding those of the collectable minifigs. His torso is also printed. In addition, he comes with a black cape and a 2 part helmet and an extra hair piece for when he&#39;s not wearing the helmet anymore. Both Superman and General Zod have two sided head pieces. One is a fairly normal head - the other side has glowing red eyes which presumably shoot lasers (that&#39;s what my son and daughter think anyway).</p>

<p><strong>Final Model:</strong></p>

<p>The final model has good playability for my kids. The escape pod swooshes and has rockets and while as a parent and AFOL I hate the rubber flick missiles, my kids enjoy playing with them. The model also has a sliding back door which I assume is a secret passageway of sorts which my kids find uses for. They have added this to their superhero collection and the set gets included in their battles, which as a parent means the set meets its primary purpose.</p>

"Berrus_Brickus","2014-04-14T23:49:50.653Z","This set is not our enemy","<p><i>Man of Steel</i> was a divisive movie and while I did like it, I see why others did not and the sets LEGO released, which are surprisingly accurate, do show one of their qualms with the movie. They are just colorless, bland, and seem much less playable than Spider-Man and Venom with a flying car or even Iron Man fighting a flamethrowing bumper cart. The most visually striking character in the movie is Superman, and even he is wearing a costume with muted reds and blues. Now, I personally was not bothered by the movie&#39;s dull palette and found it an interesting direction as it amplifies Superman&#39;s position as a beacon in a world which needs hope, but it does not do the toys based on the film much good.</p>

<p>That said, this set, which seems rather bad at first, actually surprised me. Aside from the aforementioned Spider-Man vs. Venom set and the Lex Luthor mech from the first DC wave, this is actually my favorite of the $20/&pound;20 Super Hero sets when it comes to playability, which is saying something, because those sets are usually the best in the line. However, it does have a number of other flaws holding it back.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""The_Box_and_Contents"">The Box and Contents</span></strong></h3>

<p>I personally like the box art, at least the part on the left with the foggy Metropolis below Lois&#39; escape pod, but once you shift to the right, there is a random floating platform and a still of the Black Zero command ship, which honestly comes off as looking cheap. The muted colors also do not do much to help it standout on the store shelf, the most eye catching things are the logos and the &quot;COMIC BOOK INCLUDED&quot; callout, which is pretty sad. Speaking of which, I really like the banner with Superman against an ink blot background and a blue, comic-book city.</p>

<p>There are two bags inside, an instruction manual, a comic book, and everyone&#39;s favorite, the sticker sheet. Naturally the manual came bent.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""The_Build"">The Build</span></strong></h3>

<p>We start off with the Black Zero platform, and there are no surprises. Given the pieces, I am sure that most experienced builders could guess exactly how to build it, and be pretty close.</p>

<p>The pod is a little better. It is a complete build and manages to stay fairly interesting because it has actually been designed well.</p>

<p>The build is not too exciting at all, but it is easy and decent. Usually you can&#39;t expect much better from the sets in this range.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Parts"">Parts</span></strong></h3>

<p>Do you like black and dark gray? I hope so, because pretty much every piece here is. Still, black and gray are useful colors which can be applied nearly anywhere, even if they are not the most exciting. Black Zero Escape also includes some of my favorite piece types, rare, but useful, and in a set that I am not going to regret taking apart. Admittedly, the palette does help here. Those panels on the sides of the pod are much more useful in gray than green, and there are two of them included, to boot. I have an idea for a MOC which I would love to use those for. Aside from those, though there are only a few dark tan pieces, but they are all rare (aside from the TECHNIC axle with stud) and therefore desirable. Some of my other favorite parts here are the rubber pieces with axle connections, the transparent windscreen, some rounded transparent plates, the vertical hinged plates, the tall smokey glass, various SNOT plates (three types), some SNOT bricks, a dark green chair, the wall panel, the ladder with dual clips, the five black shells, anything silver, and of course, the rarest piece in the set, a smokey 2x3 plate with clips (the only other set this appears in is 79102 Stealth Shell in Pursuit).</p>

<p>There are also a few other rare parts which aren&#39;t quite as useful, including the large, black triangle plate and the two saucer quarters.</p>

<p>Though it does not hit a great price to part ratio (169 parts for $20/&pound;20) there are plenty of larger and unique pieces which may make it worth your while, and we have not even gotten to the minifigures yet...</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Final_Model"">Final Model</span></strong></h3>

<p>...but the final model comes first. The only thing there is to see that official pictures do not show is the back of the pod, which I am glad to see has had some care put into it with a cool thruster-thing. The green exhaust, while not present in the movie, is reminiscent of Kryptonite and a cool detail which adds some life to the muted set.</p>

<p>So, I did mention before that I think this set is fun to play with. While there is not much to the model, the opening door is a unique feature which reminds me of the opening scenes of <i>A New Hope</i>, for whatever reason. It provides a way to allow Zod to make a dramatic entrance at a pivotal moment. The flick-fire missiles, which use axles instead of the traditional piece, are on a turret of sorts which can be swung back to shoot them forward. Personally, I find this much more fun than pushing a TECHNIC pin.</p>

<p>The pod has an adjustable seat for Lois (though I could not tell you why, but it provides more bars and clips) and the panels can be removed to show battle damage. I also find that the unique shape it has (for something LEGO usually releases, at least) makes it more fun to swoosh around than another helicopter or attack plane. Then, of course, it has Superman and an enemy just as powerful as he is.</p>

<p>The set&#39;s looks are not too exciting, however. The platform is sparse and really just a way to use up pieces. I do like the pod, but it is not going to get anyone too riled up, I imagine.</p>

<p>This set is pretty accurate to <i>Man of Steel</i>, aside from the minifigure inclusions. There was no catwalk, of course, nor was there a turret in the pod&#39;s room. Lois makes perfect sense in the scene and Superman makes some, as he was there to rescue her when she hurled towards Earth, but, in terms of accuracy and not marketing, Faora should have replaced Zod and Jor-El was more important here than Supes. Still though, this is very close considering some of the odd lineups we get in movie sets, and it can actually be traced back to a specific part of the film.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Minifigures"">Minifigures</span></strong></h3>

<p>Three minifigures are included: Superman, Lois Lane, and General Zod. All three are based on their appearances in <i>Man of Steel</i>.</p>

<p>I did not care for Superman&#39;s costume at first, but it has grown on me since. The silver printing and bright cape create a nice look together with the darker logo, gold, and muted blue. The hair is inaccurate to the film, but I&#39;m not too bothered. Non-purists can clip off the curl and it would be just about perfect. The new face with the red eyes for heat vision is also a nice touch. I wish we could get a new one for Batman now. Really, the only problem I have with this figure is that it needs boots to really put it over the top. They would help balance the colors even more and make him a really great figure.</p>

<p>Lois is less successful. People have said that she looks like a civilian Black Widow, and that&#39;s sadly true. The hairpiece is not very accurate, first of all, and while it is one of my favorites (over used or not) the Nurse or Pop Star&#39;s in dark orange would have looked more like Lois in the film. But what is worse is the face. It is ruined by a pair of terrible cheekbones which are huge and just look awful, and the problems do not stop there. Though the scared side would be among the best without the cheekbones, the smirk is still ruined with a strange sassy look which just comes off as evil. The torso is quite good, however. I like Amy Adams and don&#39;t mind Lois looking like her (read: I don&#39;t care that she did not color her hair for the movie) but, I would prefer that the minifigure also looked like Amy Adams and not a way for people who could not afford the Quinjet to make a budget Black Widow with Catwoman&#39;s body.</p>

<p>General Zod is probably the figure of most interest to people who are not a fan of Superman or his movie, with his unique armor, helmet, and gun, which are all spectacular. I do question the need for the gun, I think that the Alien Conquest one would have worked well enough, but it looks really cool in conjunction with the armor. My only problem with them is that the way in which the armor is designed makes it so that Zod cannot have a hairpiece with it on, which is a shame because his helmet was destroyed early on in the film, but he still continued to wear the armor up until he ripped it off before the &quot;Metropolis Showdown&quot;. The face is good and fairly accurate, though the mouth and eyes are too far apart on the non-angry side. The choice of a hairpiece is strange too; It is black, even though the goatee is brown. Still though, the hairpiece which was included is pretty rare, and my replacement of choice (just the standard &quot;Mutt Williams&quot; hair in dark brown) is pretty common. Again, those red eyes for heat vision are great. Zod isn&#39;t quite as interesting of a minifigure as Superman is without his armor, because he has literally no color, but I am excited to own him because non-Bat villains have been lacking in the DC line, and Nolanverse aside, Zod and his lackeys are possibly my favorite villains in a comicbook movie yet.</p>

<h3><strong><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Conclusion"">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>

<p>I would like to say that even though I like the movie, I do not feel that is affecting my feelings for this set, since I bought, built, and even played with it a little a couple weeks before seeing <i>Man of Steel</i>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I went in to this set with low expectations, thinking that it was just for the sub-par Lois figure, and it did surprise me. No, it did not completely blow me away: This is by no means an award winning set. It just is not attention-grabbing and the Black Zero platform comes off as pretty uninspired; a way to inflate the piece count and attach a couple of play features (even if they are ones I enjoy), but I still think it is underrated. Once it is in hand, I find that it does spark imagination quite well, possibly even better than Spidey/Venom and Superman/Lex when you consider that those are better sets, but yet I don&#39;t find this too far behind when it comes to being fun when actually playing with it. The pieces are better than most sets in this range, too.</p>

<p>This set has been on sale for ~25% off in my neck of the woods recently, and if you can find it at that price and do not mind the muted colors, I do recommend it. There is a nice part selection and Zod and Lois&#39; figures both have other applications outside of the DC Universe. Personally, I think it is also a much better set than the budget Metropolis Showdown which really does not include anything of interest if you can afford this or the larger Battle of Smallville (a review on that coming later).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-18T11:09:24.167Z","Kneel Before Zod?","<p><strong>Set #76009 Superman: Black Zero Escape: </strong>The final 2013 LEGO Super Heroes set in numerical sequence left to review is Black Zero Escape, the 25$&nbsp; CND Retail priced LEGO set from the Man of Steel sub-line. It's another unfortunate case of Mini-Figures making up a weaker selection compared to the Marvel equivalent, however it's still a nifty looking set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box really has some fun showing off Superman in action, as the flick-fire missiles launched by Zod fall apart as soon as they touch Superman in all his indestructible glory. The set has few features to showcase, the back does a fine job showing off what you get in the set and that's about it.</p>
<p>The instruction manual is the same size as we've come to expect in this price point, and a fun design with easy to follow steps for each build. The cross promotions in the back are a bit lacking, you don't get to see much in the way of actual sets and LEGO devoted an entire page to the LEGO Batman LEGO Game, which I think was either very limited in certain parts of the world or outright cancelled, because I don't remember seeing it anywhere at all.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set uses a lot of various types of sloped pieces, large bricks, small bricks, tiles, plates and any number of other useful parts for minor modification. Provided you don't apply the stickers to them. Nothing too unique or rare in the set colour or parts wise.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set once again features our famous duo, you have Man of Steel Superman and General Zod, the only unique figure in the set is Lois Lane. Our first ever Lois Mini-Fig and that's about it.</p>
<p>I won't spend too much time discussing the Kryptonians, this is the same printing found on both characters from the other two Man of Steel sets. The same capes, and the same armour from Battle of Smallville for Zod, this is a cheaper alternative to getting the armour wearing Zod if you aren't planning on picking up the larger set and that's about it honestly.</p>
<p>Lois has a great double-sided torso print showing off the costume most often worn by the character in the film. There's no Leg printing and I believe she's using the same hairpiece as Black Widow from the Quinjet set. Not sure if it's the exact same colour, however I do think it's the same piece/sculpt.</p>
<p>Not much else to say, it's a bad set for Mini-Figs unless you aren't picking up Battle of Smallville for Zod and Superman, it's great for fans of Lois and I believe this is the first character played by Amy Adams (The Actress) in LEGO form. So that's a fun fact.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There are two bags in the set, one builds a small section of the Black Zero (Zod's ship), little more than a doorway and some kind of gun emplacement to attack Superman. The other bag, number 2, builds a Kryptonian escape pod and this is the real seller of the set in my opinion.</p>
<p>They are both very fast and simple to build, nothing tricky or anything like that.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The escape pod is a really fun little build, it stands out as one of the better types of escape pods from LEGO. You can fit the Mini-Figure inside and there's a large transparent cockpit window so she can see out of it. Stickers are used for all the alien details, there are no printed elements at all.</p>
<p>The small section of Zod's ship does look nice, it matches the design of the Escape Pod and the Landing Craft from Battle of Smallville at least, there's just sadly not much to it. A flick-fire missile station for play features and a very cleverly built sliding open door, which is the best feature from the model I think. Other than that there isn't much to tell.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this is a pretty medium level set, by which I mean it isn't bad and it isn't great, it's just good. If you're a completist or want to collect all the Mini-Figures in the line and enjoy fun looking designs for your escape pods than you'll want to pick up this set.</p>
<p>If you're just interested in Lois and can take or leave the build I'd suggest looking for her on Bricklink and other such sites. Mildly recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
