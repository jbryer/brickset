<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent parts selection w/ 4 headlamps, 2 SNOT 90's, 2 L plates, no big ""one use only"" parts&nbsp;</li><li>A large lot of extra pieces.</li><li>Great model quality. The detail in such a small model is&nbsp;astounding.&nbsp;</li><li>Fun to build, fun to play with</li><li>Great colors</li><li>3 different models to build</li><li>â€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Might not be the best brick/price ratio. I found mine on clearance at the grocery store for $4.95</li><li>Some people might miss having larger plates or wings&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Definitely worth picking this one up. Especially if you're on a budget, this set will easily satisfy your LEGO cravings.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
