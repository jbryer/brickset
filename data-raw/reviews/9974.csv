"Dragon_Master_48","2012-12-29T17:05:21.27Z","Better than you might think, for its size...","<p>The ""Creator Canister"" sets, while usually very small, still manage to fit into the multiple-build 'approach'&nbsp;present in other sets in the same theme, such as <strong>31001 Mini Skyflyer</strong>.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Amazing detail through building styles.</li><li>Like three sets in one!</li><li>Amazing rebuildable possibilities.</li><li>Variety of pieces, something which contributes to the three above pros.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>None</li></ul>
<p>The incredible detail in this set is outstanding, and shows how even 62 pieces can be built- and rebuilt, and rebuilt, again and again- into a work of LEGO-art.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"hackedhead","2013-04-26T23:14:11.99Z","Excellent Mini and Great Parts","<p>Bought this a few weeks ago, very pleased. One of my first sets coming out of my dark ages.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Minis that comes in these pop-top plastic canisters are my new favorite. I'm using the canister to cart parts back and forth to work for lunchtime building.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Angle-sided plates in two sizes and colors. Four SNOT (studs not on top) supporting bricks. Good sampling of translucent stud-bricks for decorating builds. Excellent overall.<br></p><h4>Build</h4>I'll just leave this here....<br><a href=""http://youtu.be/994yXUJzGrc"">http://youtu.be/994yXUJzGrc</a><br><br><b>The completed model</b><p>Swept wing fighter is highly swooshable, as already noted by others. 
Fixed wing variant is 9/10. Shuttle/rocket version I did not get to 
before these pieces were consumed by MOCs.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Phenomenal set. Fully and highly recommended.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"RuneLar","2013-09-18T17:13:39.39Z","Nice little set","I have a call center job where I can build Lego sets while working. I found this set to be the perfect level of complexity to build within a ten minute time period. I occupy myself by memorizing the build so I can do it from memory. The main build was by far my favorite.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I didn't like how may pieces were left over from the other two models, the space shuttle especially.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would recommend this model if you are looking for a quick fun build.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
