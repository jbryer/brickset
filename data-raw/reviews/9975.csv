"fxdl96","2012-12-02T15:53:11.167Z","Great for MOC","<p>I'm a Lego Creator set collector and I own&nbsp; many sets from 2011 and 2012. I was please to see the new Creator sets line up for 2013. So on november 30, when they became available at my local TRU I went and grabbed this new baby for $17.99 CAD (same price at shop.lego.com). <br></p><p>I built all 3 models and I found the building to be very enjoyable for each one. All three model look good but the main model is the coolest (it happens almost all the time with 3 in 1 sets) . I was extremely please to see the wheels element to be compatible with technic cross-axle beam. I've been wanting this type of wheels in this size for a while to use&nbsp; in my MOC. <br></p><p>I read a blog somewhere on Lego.com about the creative design process of a Lego Creator set saying something like this ""Design, functionality, creativity"" well dont look for cool functionality in this one because it has none. If they can pack cool functions on a 56 pieces Creator set like the Mini digger, why not in this one? I'm not asking for&nbsp; a steering system but something like adjusting ailerons would be a great addition.<br></p><p> As for playability, it is equal to a hot-wheel car that you push and pull around making engine sound with your mouth. But then again the playability of most Creator sets is in the building process. obviously, you buy Creator sets because you are a Lego builder, not a&nbsp; minifig or Star-Wars fan!&nbsp; <br></p><p>If you are looking for great side building elements and some nice yellow parts for your MOC you might like this set as much as I do. Since it has no cool functions and only 121 pieces, $14,99 CAD would be a much more decent price. <br>
</p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The pieces selection is excellent for MOC</li><li>All the models look great<br></li><li>The new wheel rims with cross axle are just awesome!</li><li>Some nice side building parts<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No minifig and not minifig compatible</li><li>Limited playability<br></li><li>Except for the turning wheels, there is no functionality<br></li><li>Not a&nbsp; good price per piece ratio for Canada (17.99 CAD)<br></li></ul>
The day Lego will decide to make their Creator vehicles minifig compatible and throw in a few nice ones in te box, is the day they will sell twice as much Creator Sets!<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,2

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>All builds are real solid, unlike some Creator sets where the 3rd build is pretty weak<br></li><li>Racecar looks fast due to many covered studs and flowing surface<br></li><li>8 of those nice SNOT pieces, 10 bricks with bow</li><li>Cool air intake, sideview mirrors, and spoiler detail</li><li>Quad is neat, like a chunky <span class=""st""> Bombardier</span></li><li><span class=""st"">Color combo is pretty cool<br></span></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Technic axle sticks out of wheels, this could have been fixed by suppling a Technic Axle 7 instead of 8<br></li><li>Steering wheel looks awkward, could be set back further somehow</li></ul>
<p>This is my second favorite build of 2013 so far :)<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

<p>As usual with racing cars,&nbsp;I get it not because I wanted this particular model, but just because I wanted to get some Lego. I didn&#39;t even build&nbsp;it, though I must say that&nbsp;the main model and it&#39;s alternatives look&nbsp;very good.</p>

<p>But my, oh my, what a cool selection of pieces&nbsp;it has! They are ideal for making little space ships and futuristic aircrafts. When I opened the box, I started to assemble them randomly and couldn&#39;t stop.</p>

<p>Overall, pretty straightforward set with great variety of diverse and useful parts. If it was 2013, I&#39;d recommend it with no hesitation, but nowadays I don&#39;t think it has any special value.</p>
