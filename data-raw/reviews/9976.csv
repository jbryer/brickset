<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Sleekness of finished model, only the exposed studs on rotors detract from smoothness<br></li><li>Like most Creator series you get three models to build</li><li>Plenty of good parts</li><li>Awesome swooshability<br></li><li>Working door on helicopter</li><li>Fighter plane is a fun short build</li><li>Very solid construction of body, will survive kids playing with it<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Hovercraft build is pretty meh<br></li><li>Exposed studs on rotors could have been a 1x6 plate<br></li></ul>
<p>This has been my favorite build of 2013, granted its only my 5th 2013 set ;)<br></p><p><br></p><h4><br></h4>",TRUE,5,2,3,5,5
"PeteM","2014-06-24T19:31:59.457Z","Small, but perfectly formed","<p>I do love these little Creator sets &ndash; as someone who struggles with MOC&rsquo;ing, seeing what can be achieved with so few pieces is an inspiration. And the chance to build three different models from the same pieces (give or take) always makes a set feel good value! For a &lsquo;small&rsquo; set, it still contains quite a variety of pieces, many of which are useful for studless building &ndash; not least a decent amount of 1x1 and 1x2 slopes &ndash; so long as you like red&hellip;!</p>

<h3>Main Build</h3>

<p>A nameless tandem-blade helicopter that is nevertheless clearly based on a Chinook &ndash; as the main model this doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, with the compact design still offering up plenty of interest. The opening rear ramp was a nice surprise, allowing access to an admittedly tiny hold space and the integration of the orange accents to the body is neatly done. Despite the small size of the model, there are plenty of details included, such as engine ventilation grills and small transparent 1x1 bricks for windows. In terms of SNOT work, there is some deceptively simple sideways building to create the nose, and the method of offsetting the rotor blades using two of standard propeller clips and a technic bracket for each one is ingenious (at least to someone not used to such techniques!). It&rsquo;s a lovely little model when finished, and looks good on a shelf if you&rsquo;re of the &lsquo;build and display&rsquo; mindset.</p>

<h3>Additional Builds</h3>

<p>Of the secondary builds, the small fighter plane is the better of the two. Solid and colourful, it&rsquo;s a charming model, albeit with what are clearly supposed to be forward-mounted guns synchronised to fire through the propeller. The small propeller is positioned centrally on the front using the same method as the main build. While not as elegant as the helicopter, this is still an eminently &#39;swooshable&#39; model!</p>

<p>The hovercraft is serviceable and mostly unremarkable, though the construction of the sideways-build &lsquo;skirt&rsquo; at the front was interesting, even if it doesn&rsquo;t look completely convincing on the final model.</p>

<p>There are instructions for a &lsquo;bonus&rsquo; fourth speedboat build available online, but I found this to be disposable and uninteresting compared to the others.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Definitely worth a purchase, especially for those who need a bit of inspiration, or just have their eyes opened as to the possibilities in effective utilisation of just a few simple parts to create something small but perfectly formed. As I believe should happen with all the best creator sets, I defy anyone, after having built the three models, not to break it all up, try a bit of free building and see what happens!</p>

"mafon2","2017-06-16T01:48:00.33Z","Flying house","<p>I have two main gripes with this set:</p>

<p>1. I don&#39;t like the shape of Chinook. And in red execution it starts to remind me of a flying brick house:&nbsp;just look at these square windows and red tiling on the roof. And the bottom is just flat, like it took off from foundation.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;d benefited from some exaggeration.</p>

<p>2. Rotors are very shaky, and scrape&nbsp;against plastic, making rattling&nbsp;noise and do not rotate properly. I admire unusual way of adjusting them, but it doesn&#39;t work that well.</p>

<p>Also, the back door opens revealing a 2x1 piece depicting a lamp or a signal light, but sadly there&#39;s no sensible way to put something inside.</p>

<p>The plane as an alternative build looks to me more interesting and engaging. Again, sadly it has a drawback: minifig don&#39;t fit into nacelle. Boat, on the other hand, looks meh, but has a space for minifig. So there&#39;s no win-win scenario.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a &quot;C&quot; set for me and &quot;B&quot; set for&nbsp;Chinook&nbsp;enthusiasts.</p>
