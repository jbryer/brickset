Somehow it felt ""different""... Also, it just so happens that my son has been watching a lot of those Yakari cartoons lately, with native Indians, eagles, beavers and even scorpions in it.&nbsp;Then as we were roaming the hypermarket and passed the LEGO counters together, we collectively fell in love with it and we just ""had to"" buy it immediately. On the way home my 5-year was constantly exulting over how it would be his first thing to do building it once we're back.</p><p>I must admit this set looked bigger and even better in reality than on picture. This does not hold for the box itself that got shrunk quite a bit compared to sets with similar number of pieces&nbsp;from past years.&nbsp;The building process took a while (45 minutes) because my son got a little bored with the eagle's legs in the end. The box says ""from age 7 to 12"" and although a 5-year old can easily handle most of the phases, it's only that they not necessarily have patience to wait until the model is finished.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>all 3 models are equally excellent</li><li>great playability</li><li>a couple of rare bricks and colours</li><li>the usual spare parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>those brown colours on the instructions are a bit too dark for such a small&nbsp;booklet</li><li>nothing else really!</li></ul>
<p>All in all, a wonderful set, especially for little boys! Lots of fun to build and then to play both for kids and adults.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Nesquik","2013-04-15T08:05:18.31Z","Fierce Flyer, Silly Scorpion and Boring Beaver","Although the Creator product line is made up of sub themes (as with other lines), animals and creatures still seem something of a rarity. This isn't too surprising when one considers the difficulties are using blocks to portray organic shapes, but it's not all together out of the question. Part and parcel of the fun - strangely - is how our smaller and larger friends look in stacked fashion.<div><br></div><div>Fierce Flyer is one of a kind, and it's clear that the designers understood how plates, hinges and slopes could make an effective feathered creature. The resulting model is immense fun to look at, and a perfect compliment to sit on any desk that may pass you by. It's because of the strength in personality that this product really shines - you can pose Fierce the Eagle in many different ways, including vertical joints between the wings and body, horizontal joints to move them forwards or backwards, and more vertical joints on his legs and claws to finish the effect. This includes his individual talons and feet, too.</div><div><br></div><div>As he sits proudly on the surface, you may want to go for a composed look with his wings tucked against his body and leaning upwards. Predators about? Then go for the action shot and spread those mighty wings out, combined with the feet open for attack. Whatever his mood, you've pretty much got it covered, and the model looks even more effective if hung from the ceiling with fishing wire.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One <i>minor</i>&nbsp;niggle would be that his head wasn't placed between some Technics pins so that it could move back and forth, but part of the Creator joy is the ease to which you can modify your models. Lego are encouraging the user to do just that, and I think it's great because this is an element of play that has been missing from other product lines (in particular, City) for some time.</div><div><br></div><div>I bought this product for the Eagle, and as expected, the other two models are pretty boring. The Beaver is somewhat acceptable purely for the building process, but the scorpion just doesn't look right at all. The eyes may have something to do with this, but again, I always consider the 'other two' Creator models expendable to the primary design.</div><div><br></div><div>£9.99 for 166 pieces and the final model scale (Eagle) is very decent, making it affordable to pretty much every Lego fan. It would also be ideal for a small gift!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"jimred","2013-03-14T07:51:59.763Z","One of those unexpected gems","<p>When I saw early images of this set it got put on my Brickset want list for further&nbsp;investigation. Not usually a fan of the creator stuff, but this looked interesting.&nbsp;As soon as it appeared in the local Lego shop I tried unsuccessfully for a couple of months to get my son to say he wanted it, but he's having a city thing at the mo, so fair enough. I then tried to justify it as a parts pack. For £9.99&nbsp;with lots of lovely brown, plus of course claw ideas for that dragon I am going to make one day, it was approved.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The build is straightforward, not really anything ground breaking, but there are some nice bits around the wings and the body shape is very&nbsp;pleasing.&nbsp;The real standout aspect of this set is the posability of the final model. You can have the wings arched and the claws outstretched as though it's about to pounce on it's prey, or you can sweep back the wings and tuck back the claws for regular flight. It also stands well unsupported, so maximum marks for playability. Also, grab yourself an Attack of the Wargs set and you have all the components for your Hobbit scene re-enactment. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>I haven't made the&nbsp;alternative models yet. Mainly because they just don't look as appealing as the eagle. </p>
<p>In summary - for ten quid it's a well designed and highly playable model. Get one. <o:p></o:p></p>

"Vaclav_Mesaros","2013-10-07T08:13:47.06Z","One of the Best","The real value of this set is much higher even if there are no red bricks or wheels. I bough it for myself with the only aim - to build an alternative out of it. You can find the result on my moc page.<div>...and of course I would recommend it to anybody else!</div>",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
"iuliand","2014-02-15T21:35:18.19Z","Bigger and better than I thought would be","<p>I will only comment the main model as I only built that and I&#39;m not really interested in the B and C models.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard Creator inventory, nothing special. In the box there are two leaflets (one for the main model and one for the other two) and three un-numbered bags.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Overall an interesting collection of parts. I personally haven&#39;t seen before the tail part #92692 but I see it is mainly used in Ninjago and Chima sets and I was never interested in those.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Interesting build. A little repetitive for the second wing and leg.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks awesome! It is bigger than I expected. All the joints really help the looks and playability. It can fold the wing, adjust the tail and close the claws.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:<br />
- Large model (larger than the box suggest)<br />
- Sturdy build<br />
- Good playability<br />
- Awesome looks<br />
- Good price</p>

<p>Cons:<br />
- Could use a way to attach a minifig on it&#39;s back. The only spot available is too close to the tail.<br />
- A joint for the neck would have been nice (to rotate the head a little).</p>

<p>Actually this model is close to perfection. It doesn&#39;t really have any major cons and as it can be seen I was struggling to find those &quot;cons&quot;...</p>

"Cake_Crafted","2014-09-13T11:13:27.117Z","The Eagle Has Landed","<p>I got this set last year from the Lego Shop in Cardiff. It is the only animal set I have wanted to get apart from&nbsp;4994 Fierce Creatures, which I failed to get.</p>

<p>It looks really good, a lot better than other animal sets (although some of the newer ones don&#39;t look too bad). The wings and legs are also poseable, which&nbsp;makes it even better.</p>

<p>As with most Creator sets, this has two other builds, a Scorpion and a Squirrel, however I still have not built these. I just think that they look terrible when compared to the Eagle.<span class=""rangySelectionBoundary"" id=""selectionBoundary_1410603075815_6125652049668133"" style=""line-height: 0; display: none;"">?</span></p>

<p>Overall this set is definitely worth the money, and looks good in any collection.&nbsp;</p>
