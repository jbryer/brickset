"TinyHippo","2013-01-04T13:37:05.5Z","Price Point Perfect","To kick this off: I love Lego. I'm completely biased, a lot of the time. So when my friends (who are almost 30, like me) whine about how Lego isn't as good as when we were young, about how it's all too new and expensive, I argue with them it's not. They refuse to see reason, and in that sense they would refuse to see this set for what it is. Three models, clever construction, a lovely selection of parts, including the 2x1 cheese slope in white (I've never seen that before), and cheap..! <br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great part selection<br></li><li>Some unique parts</li><li>Clever construction</li><li>Super cost-effective<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not as many functions on the two secondary models<br></li><li>The eponymous model looks a little too blocky from one angle. Barely.</li></ul><p>I don't use mini-figures and I don't love licensed sets accordingly, but if you want a neat model, with awesome parts, for a good price? This is it. Welcome to 2013. It looks good.<br></p>

A great set for small detail pieces, cheese slopes, curved slopes, tiles and plates. Would definitely buy several copies in different colours to pad out my collection.<br><br>Buying in Malaysia I usually have a shortage of interesting set choices, TRU usually carries the branded sets at way above their UK or US listed price. This creator set was only 100 Malaysian Ringit, still 33% above the converted UK price, but I picked up 2.<br><br>Half the pieces are small, but I lack these detail pieces in quantity and was happy to add them to the collection.<br><br>The main model was somewhat fun to build but nothing out of the ordinary. The finished car was great looking externally and I pushed it around the desk for 10 minutes before making some quick mods including extending the doors and dropping the floor pan to make it look more realistic.<br><br>Great little set and a recommended buy as a present for fan or non fan alike. Please Lego Group make it in some more colours and you'll get a repeat customer.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"TECHNIC222","2013-07-10T14:12:35.36Z","It's a neat Creator sports car, pretty but boring to build and play.","<p>highway speedster is a new set within the launch of the new Creator line. The box sports a huge blue seaside road with a blue sea stretching out until the edge of the box. speaking of&nbsp; &quot;box side&quot;, the left side&nbsp;of the box features a view of the two dissapointing alternate moddels. (Truck and caterham). the oppisite features a handy parts list. and it also tells us a story of the car being six studs wide&nbsp;proving by&nbsp;showing a nice wheel fit for MT&#39;s and six stud cars.&nbsp;(was expecting sparkling silver) The back features the sleek speedster and it&#39;s alternate builds (it still has the frosty blue\white background).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>contents.</p>

<p>inside, a full three instruction manuals are accompained by one big bag and two polys. in common with most basic brick creator sets,&nbsp; NO stickers. (hooray!!) one of the manuals features a ad for city Great vehicles whilst all manuals dont feature WIN!! instead a disturbingly faced mascot that.&nbsp;ushers you to go log on to Lego club. (short answer Max, no) there is quite a variety of curves&nbsp;and bows inside the bags too. the wheels look inviting...</p>

<p>Build.</p>

<p>The build isn&#39;t (to me) a time consuming build. the main model is a rubix cube of building strategeys and the main model has a huge bug bear; high chassis=no minifig space. build 2 has a sneaky lift system.......built into the rear axle! no.3 is another mode of&nbsp;a &quot;classic racer&quot;, last seen in the blue roadster in 2012.</p>

<p>conclusion</p>

<p>i think personaly that the highway speedster is a little dissapointing (boring to play) and it is a bit pricey. the alt modes gently fix this but, the truck is limited by its failed tow hook and the main and C model are just a bit puke. but its well worth it compared to thunder wings...</p>

Then i build the truck which has a very good look in my opinion. I saved the main build for last. And it was a good build. You can open the engine cover to reveal the big V6 engine, open the doors (vertically!) and remove the T-roof. The model looks so nice. Well done LEGO!</p>

<p>The best part, there are so many MOC&#39;s for this set, available on the internet with instructions.</p>

<p>Good set and many special parts. I recommend this set.</p>
