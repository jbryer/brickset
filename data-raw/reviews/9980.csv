This wasn't ever possible back then, due to the lack of high-friction joints. Even the high friction technic bushings at the time could only support micro scale bipeds before succumbing to the weight of the torso. This build revisits the bipedal idea with more recent joints and the result is excellent.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Like all recent Creators of this size, the box shows the full parts list break down on the spine in addition to action shots of the 3 builds. Three separate booklets inside, one for each build.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Great parts. Handful of nice arches and bows and slopes. Several SNOT (studs not on top) supporting bricks and the JOINTS! Ball joints in the arms and high-friction dual axis joints at the hips, in addition to two more center pieces of this joint style hidden in the body of the bot (non functioning in the bot build, but present in the box nonetheless). Bad robot arms for fingers are great. and you get six! good selection of other rod-and-clip parts as well. The first time I saw this set, I was put off by the green, but it's already growing on me. Variety and all that.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special to note. Left and right arm, leg and foot builds are instructed individually. Save time by just mirror-building each off instructions for one.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Main model is extremely pose-able. High friction hip joints make it able to support the torso weight at fairly steep angles. Arms are slightly limited by shoulder/upper arm construction. Can easily and simply be thinned down to support more range. Fingers are not very strong for grasping, but look great.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Glad I bought it. Over 200 pcs for $20USD gives it a great value. Main model is everything I wanted out of a bot from childhood.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"omnius","2019-03-20T04:21:40.267Z","Great for Transformers fans!","<p>I got this set not long after it came out, and I cannot recommend it enough. You can build a robot, 4WD truck or helicopter, with the implication being that the robot can transform into either of these (sound familiar?). Even if the robot mode doesn&#39;t do it for you, it&#39;s worth picking up if you&#39;re a fan of trucks or helicopters as these builds are excellent. You get a lot of lime green parts, and the robot mode is very posable thanks to a combination of hinge, ball and friction joints.</p>

<p>For a fun bit of background, this is very similar to the character Bulkhead from the <em>Transformers: Prime</em> series. A burly-looking robot that transforms into a 4WD truck, the resemblance is immediately apparent:</p>

<p>The helicopter mode calls back to an earlier version of Bulkhead, from the&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Energon</em>&nbsp;series, where he turned into a &#39;copter.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of Transformers, a fan of robots, trucks, helicopters or just good sets, I highly recommend tracking this one down.</p>
