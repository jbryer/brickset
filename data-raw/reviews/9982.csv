With the usual 3 in 1, you can build a new model everytime you get bored. Great playability and is good for kids and adults.<br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is pretty good and shows all of the models several times. It is also a pretty good size. Lego have finally decided to make their boxes a bit smaller compared to last year which is good but good box size for this set anyway.<br><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set contains some great parts as well as using many basic bricks. It comes with a door, two large glass windows and a few smaller glass windows as well. Some special parts are: skateboard, cup, hot dog and nice navy-blue coloured roof tiles.&nbsp;</p><h4>Price</h4><p>Fairly decent price but here in oz we pay a lot more than the US, but I was lucky enough to purchase it 20% off the original price.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Just the one minifig for this one, fairly plain but good figure anyway to add to the population of your town/city. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not much to say here but a fairly enjoyable build for all three models. I enjoyed making the roof of all models and of course installing that famous sliding door.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p> All models are good, however my favourite one is probably the main one displayed on the box. It includes some great features and I especially love the sliding door and spinning chair. The house also has a large garden area with a grill, pond and table for backyard picnics. Also great how it opens up at the back for easy playability. <br></p><p>Model 2 (the skaters house) is also really good. It has two rooms in it: in one room there is a desk with a lamp (love the use of the sausage here). The other room has a spinning chair just like the first house. This model can close up as well but it looks better open. The front of the house features a nice garden and a tap.<br></p><p>Instead of including another house for the final model of this set, LEGO decided to make it a windmill which I reckon was a fairly good idea. It has good detail and a nice garden area like both other models. All 3 buildings make good use of the base plates included.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall great set and definitely a must buy if you have a town of some sort. You can put it in any town whether your near the beach or at the top of a mountain. It's pretty rare to have a creator house set under $40 Aus or $25 US so make sure you get your hands on it ASAP cause it's another 2013 set well worth getting. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"CherryRose","2015-10-10T21:03:46.667Z","Let's Relax and Get all Cozy","<p>Houses have been around since the inception of, well, just about everything in human society. From hunter-gatherers in caves to sky-high apartments, just about everyone needs one of these things, and Lego is no exception, from little microscale pieces to giant sets like the Pet Shop. This set may be small, but it packs in just about every necessity you need, but most importantly, it&#39;s really cute and cozy, and almost feels like a vacation home you&#39;d want to live in.</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>It&#39;s kinda surprising how large the set is for the price point, taking up 16x22 studs in length and width. It&#39;s not giant or anything, but it&#39;s enough to have a good spot for natural alone time (which is nice given there&#39;s only 1 person), having a delicious barbecue to relax and eat by the lake, and when you&#39;re done with all your desktop work, you can go out to skateboard down to the park. But what&#39;s really neat is the full-sized sliding door,</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>The set is rather simple in it&#39;s appearance, it&#39;s only modestly sized and rather basic. While generously closed up on all 4 sides, the windows everywhere still allow for plenty of light to shine through, but no so much as to reduce it&#39;s warm, fuzzy feeling, and it&#39;s quite adorably stereotypical.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>Much of the parts in this set are generic to be used for other homes, and are in only a few colors--red, white and navy blue, and they&#39;re merely varying dimensions of bricks, windows and loads of roof tiles respectively. It may not seem like much, but it&#39;s good for using to just make whatever building you want to make without having to worry about small details, and it gives a large enough quantity to give a nice, consistent appearance no matter what you do.</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>Simple yet sweet. It&#39;s long enough so that it feels accomplished, but not so long that it can&#39;t be quickly taken apart to make the other models (see below). Just simple, brick-upon-brick construction that while not new or educating, is relaxing.</p>

<h3>The Alternate Models</h3>

<p>Alongside the main cottage build, there&#39;s a Windmill and a Skater&#39;s House. The Skater&#39;s house is not dramatically different from the main model, in that it still takes it&#39;s basic square/pentagon shape when closed up, only this time, there&#39;s the option of opening it up completely to get a wider appearance from the front, and gives full access to the interior (which even includes a clever little sausage-lamp). From the outside, the only significant change is the use of the sliding door element to make a good-size skating ramp. As of yet, I have not built the Windmill, but it does seem the same way, only more vertical and mish-moshed (although it&#39;s kinda cheating to include a technic brick solely to attach the blades :p).</p>

<h3>Overall Value</h3>

<p>For a mere $25, you get just about all you would ever want for a calm, classic house that lies right in the Goldilocks zone. It&#39;s a great example of how less really is more, and I would definitely recommend it for even those on the tightest of budgets and experience--or even the largest for that matter.</p>
