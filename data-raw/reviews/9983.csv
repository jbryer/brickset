Suprisingly, they actually had a few new sets, such as this one. This was the only Speedor they had, so this is the one I got. Simple, right? </p>
<p>I took this home, and of course, built it.</p>
<p>The build was very simple, beginning with the minifigure, then moving on to the flames cones, followed by the golden weapon.next to be built was the Speedor, more on that later, with a pictoral tutorial of how to use the ripcord and Speedor.Then you build and attach the power-up.</p>
<p>Next up are the Jungle Gates. These begin with making a ""pillar"" on top of a boulder half. Then, you attach the lion statue face and the arch piece. next, you create a mirror image of the pillar with lion statue face and attach the sections.Finally, you add some flames and large leaf pieces.</p>
<p>Minifig</p>
<p>Lennox: This lion tribe minifigure has the standard head piece mold for his tribe.This has an angry, fanged mouth with a beard. He has a Dark Blue headband of sorts with a black outline and a brown mane. He has a silver Chima breastplate with a trans light blue 1x1 round tile on the front and 2 empty studs on the back.Under the headpiece is a standardminifig head with a happy, lionlike face. On the other side is a determined battle ready face. His torso printing consists of some muscle outline and a shoulder strap with a Chi orb printed on. The back has the rest of the strap. In terms of printing, the torso and legs are connected by a lion tribe beltm with goes down to a blue ""skirt"" and lion kneepads. His feet have toes and claws printed on them. The weapons are a silver spear and a golden chainsaw with a large white spick and small gold spicke, plus a trans&nbsp;light blue 1x1 round tile.</p>
<p>Cards </p>
<p>Lennox Character Card: Instinct: 50, Speed: 40 or 60, Courage: 30 or 50, Strength:20</p>
<p>Defendor VI Speedor Card: Instinct: 10 or 40, Speed: 10 or 40, Courage: 30 or 60, Strength: 20</p>
<p>Decalius Weapon Card: Instinct: 30 or 70, Speed: 20, Courage: 40, Strength: 10</p>
<p>Jabaka Weapon Card: Instinct: 20, Speed: 10, Courage: 50, Strength: 40 or&nbsp;50</p>
<p>Rototo Power-up card: Instinct: 30 or 50, Speed: 20, Courage: 20, Strength: 10 or 30</p>
<p>Speedor:</p>
<p>Defendor VI: This is a yellow lion speedor with a chrome silver eye, exhaust vents, and one side of the mouth on each side. There is a brown mane with a silver lion tribe logo on either side. The powerup is very simply, 2 wheels, which works better than two blades dragging on the floor.</p>
<p>Accessories:</p>
<p>This set includes a yellow ripcord, 6 Chi crystals, and 2 dark grey 2x2 round dishes with small flames for cones.</p>
<p>Gates:</p>
<p>First of all, there are 2 gates. So yeah.</p>
<p>Each gate is 16 studs wide, excluding the extra width of the boulders. The pieces in general are mentioned in the build section. They are a fairly simple arch design.The object is to send your Speedor through the Jungle Gates and between the flame cones.</p>
<p>Verdict:</p>
<p>Great set for any fan of Chima, Speddorz, or Lego in general.</p>
<p>Bye for now!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-13T17:54:14.413Z","Pass Through the Gates, Mighty Lion Warrior Lennox.","<p><strong>Set #70104 Jungle Gates: </strong>We&rsquo;re coming to the end of the Speedorz reviews for what I own, and I have to say a lot of them are either hit or meh, really meh in some cases. And yet they&rsquo;re great for weapons, Minifigures and the cards, those wonderful cards really stand out. Today we&rsquo;re discussing Lennox&rsquo;s individual Speedor set.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>As always when it comes to LEGO instructions the steps are done quite nicely with easy to follow instructions and include numerous cross-promotional images in the back. As well as the instructions for the game play in numerous languages, it&rsquo;s your standard design and works perfectly without any issues.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Lennox: In this set you&rsquo;ll find this wonderfully designed member of the lion tribe, he has a double-sided torso and standard leg printing, the head piece is the same and he has a double-sided facial print. One side is smiling and the other he&rsquo;s gritting his teeth and angry.</p>

<p>His weapons are a simple spear, or Jabaka as it&rsquo;s called, and the Decalius built weapon using a gold saw, a gold small tooth, a white large tooth and a gold Ninjago hilt piece. They&rsquo;re nice enough weapons, though not as special as some of the others that are offered in similar sets.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>Lennox is unique, for whatever reason LEGO included him twice in sets with Speedorz, so he has a speedor in this set and in the Eagle&rsquo;s Castle set. It&rsquo;s your standard lion tribe looking speedor with the printing on either side showing the eyes, whiskers and mane of a lion.</p>

<p>The add-on in the back for this Speedor is a pair of extra wheels. This is an odd choice, on the one hand it helps to balance the speedor when on the shelf, on the other it&rsquo;s a curious play feature. Why would the character want or need an extra pair of wheels? It looks like it would add more drag to the vehicle, making it move slower rather than faster.</p>

<p>Ah well, it&rsquo;s a nice looking speedor at least.</p>

<p>The Model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>With Jungle Gates you get a model that is pretty much more of a set piece for your Speedor than most anything else. Not much of an obstacle, you get two identically built wooden archways, with leafy fronds added on top and some small plants built into the rock sides of each &lsquo;gate&rsquo;. The models are built exactly the same, include some nice stone lion-faces pieces and the tops of LEGO boulders. Just the tops though, so you can&rsquo;t combine them to make any actual boulders.</p>

<p>To add some obstacles to the play feature, you get two trash lids with fire attached to it that you can place in front of, or in between the gates to trip up a speedor. Unfortunately they aren&rsquo;t much to look at.</p>

<p>In this set you get the Lennox card, Defendor VI the Speedor card, Decalius and Jabaka weapon cards and Rototo card, for the add-on wheels to the speedor. These cards are always impressive, the artwork and the individual names are just fun. I enjoy collecting them, just sad LEGO doesn&rsquo;t try to get into the trading card game world, it&rsquo;d be pretty impressive to include builds with each card set as some kind of add-on for the game.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a really nice Speedor set, the gate build might be repetitive to build, but they make some decent display scenery for a Chima shelf and work well as a fun game element, it&rsquo;s a blast trying to get your speedor through the gates and they don&rsquo;t fall apart as easily as some of the other play features. As always I love the cards. The weapons for Lennox aren&rsquo;t too special unfortunately and the added &lsquo;obstacles&rsquo; are a joke, but I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this set over some of the others as a great fun little build.</p>

<p>Lennox is also a great looking Minifigure. I&rsquo;m curious to know why LEGO chose him to include twice in the speedor sets instead of giving Crooler one.</p>

"RandOpossum","2022-02-22T00:19:36.54Z","One of the best looking speedorz builds","<p>This build looks incredible for a speedorz set! These gates are awesome and wide enough for the Speedorz to run through. The final product&nbsp;was very satisfying, and I felt great assembling the pieces. However, the rest is pretty lackluser, as the side decors are just flames and, in my opinion, lion Speedorz look pretty basic, which is unfortunate because this &quot;same looking Speedorz syndrome&quot; as I like to call it is very common between the sets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m&nbsp;not a very big fan of the Lion minifigures, but this is the best set to buy Lennox, whereas the other sets are either expensive or come with a book. Retail price is a bit overpriced and its preferable to buy it in its current value of 8 bucks.</p>
