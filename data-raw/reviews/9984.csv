<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box (which is actually a blister pack)&nbsp;has some very nice detailing and shows&nbsp;Eglor speeding up the&nbsp;leaf ramp and hitting the nest.&nbsp;(Which for some reason has the Chi in it.) the Speedor and cards are&nbsp;packaged&nbsp;similarly to&nbsp;the Spinners and&nbsp;cards in the Ninjago spinners line.&nbsp;one thing noteworthy is that the picture on&nbsp;here shows&nbsp;blue 2x1 bricks in the&nbsp;clear space at the bottom left corner of the box, whereas in reality there are no blue 2x1 bricks in this set.</p><p>The instructions come folded in the box and are well done as always and show how to play this challenge. (More on that later.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are quite good and include a lot brown 3x4 plates W/angles. It also has for lime green leaf pieces, and a few dish pieces.</p><p>The <strong>Speedor</strong> is well designed and has some nice eagle detailing&nbsp;and runs extremely well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The single minifig included in this set is the eagle <strong>Eglor</strong>, is very nice, and is packed with detail. His torso is printed with a dark blue jumpsuit, with a pair of printed silver eagle wings for decoration.&nbsp;He also has two straps connecting to his belt. His back is printed with a continuation of his&nbsp;front printing. His legs are also printed with some more straps and feathers. on his feet are some yellow talons which are accurate to an eagle IRL. Eglor's head&nbsp;is light blue and double-sided. One side&nbsp;is printed with a generic eagle face, and the other features a monocle. His 'mask' is the standard eagle 'mask' with three feathers sticking out at the back of&nbsp;the 'mask'.&nbsp;The 'mask' is also&nbsp;printed with some silver feather detailing. His&nbsp;Chi harness is silver and is the same mold as any other Chi harness. His wings are also the same mold as any other Chima wings. Overall an excellent minifig, but what makes him even better is that&nbsp;this is the first time this minifig appears&nbsp;in a&nbsp;set that is not hard-to-find.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build takes about ten minutes and is enjoyable however there are no techniques of intrest unlike some other&nbsp;Speedorz.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is great and easy to play. If you don't&nbsp;get how to play I will explain it below:</p><p>(Anybody who already knows how to play can skip this.)</p><p>1. Unleash your&nbsp;Speedorz&nbsp;at the same time.</p><p>2. Aim for the leaf ramp facing you.</p><p>3. Try and get your&nbsp;Speedor into the nest. Or you can do it the easier way witch is trying to get your Speedor OVER the nest.</p><p>4. Whoever&nbsp;gets their Speedor into the nest first wins.</p><p>For the cards you do the following:</p><p>1.&nbsp;Whoever wins&nbsp;the challenge picks a card first, and&nbsp;if they can play it, (which is decided by if the animal symbol in the top right corner matches yours) they choose one of the stats to play: Instinct (yellow), speed (red), courage (green), and strength (purple). That player&nbsp;then announces what they chose. E.g. 40 speed. However a player cannot play a stat if&nbsp;it is greater than the one on their character card.</p><p>2. The other player&nbsp;has to pick a card and if it is higher than 40 speed then he wins, if not player 1 wins. If it's a tie keep repeating this process until somebody wins.</p><p>3. Once somebody wins the winner takes two&nbsp;Chi , the first person to six Chi wins. Get it?</p><p>Anyway once you get to know how to play the game is very fun! I also really like the detailing on the nest!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>This set is certainly a Speedorz worth buying and all these great&nbsp;points give this set a...</p><p>5/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2016-06-27T16:43:38.353Z","Giant Nest Fails at Speedorz Gameplay.","<p><strong>Set #70105 Nest Dive: </strong>The Speedorz as a whole are either hit or miss, there are a lot of potential bad points or good points you can find in these sets. Aside from the fact that the price is always a bit of a downer, the contents are perfect for creating your own Speedorz challenges either for your Legends of Chima Display or just to play the game.</p>

<p>The big draw for me for these sets, besides the Minifigures and the Speedorz Chariots which can be fun to just collect and display, are the cards for the game. I dig the collectible cards in these. My past reviews were a bit more, for the purposes of the new Speedorz reviews from me we&rsquo;ll discuss the pros and cons of each set before discussing the overall opinion.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eglor&rsquo;s Unique Speedorz includes two extra wings and has an awesome print detail for it.</li>
	<li>Six Chi crystals are included like with all Speedorz sets.</li>
	<li>Main build of the set can work as a nest for the eagle tribe to display alongside.</li>
	<li>Includes Eglor, Shreekor 390, Lightnix, Jabahak and Aerozor collectible game cards.</li>
	<li>Eglor Minifigure is brilliantly detailed, double-sided torso print, leg printing, double-sided face and twin weapons designed for maximum offense.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Main model features few pieces considering the price.</li>
	<li>Model is also weakly designed for the game, lacks decent execution for use with Speedorz, requiring blind luck for the Speedor to land inside the nest.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I find this set to be fairly decent if you can get it on sale, however as far as the game is concerned it suffers a great deal for the contents of the build and the piece count. I&rsquo;d recommend the set to hard core collectors of the Theme, fans of the game would get more out of some of the other sets. Eglor is a decent Minifigure though, the nice dark blue colour stands out compared to the rest of the tribe and his availability is limited appearing mostly in unique sets. This is the cheapest alternative to any official vehicle builds.</p>
