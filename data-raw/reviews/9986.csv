We&rsquo;ll go over the pros and cons now and then make final thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Winzar&rsquo;s Speedor is included in this set and looks pretty impressive, I like the print on this one it stands out and really matches the character well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes the Winzar, Huntor W4, Chi Jahak, Flamious and Dikut Collectible Cards.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Main model uses a lot of nice white and clear blue parts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Winzar minifigure has double-sided torso print, double-sided facial print, leg printing and great looking head piece.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Winzar&rsquo;s accessories are again not as impressive for weapons as other Speedorz sets. Also he doesn&rsquo;t have his chest armour piece.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Main model build in the set is decent but uses fewer pieces than it should for a decent sized tower and it looks like it could use a better designed base.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I feel that this Speedorz set is pretty nice for what it is, a cheap method to get Winzar and his Speedor, however recommending it is more for completists or fans of the game. I will admit that this set works as a decent challenge for the Speedorz game, it&rsquo;s a tower and you need to knock it over to get the CHI Orb, which is included in this set. So for this one I&rsquo;m recommending it only for completists and only if you can find it on sale, full price is not worth it for this one.</p>
