"Phrea","2013-01-20T17:42:03.76Z","Impressive Moto Cross Bike that looks the part !","<p>When I saw the bike online, I knew I had to have it, to compliment my <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9392-1"">9392 Quad Bike</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the two aren't exactly the same scale, but they do look very nice together on a shelf.&nbsp;</p><p>The build was a lot of fun, you build the center first, then the back, and finally the front of the bike.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun to build</li><li>Great pieces [2+1 springs, chain, the wheels and tires are absolutely brilliant, motor block, exhaust system, etc]</li><li>I also love the colour scheme, I know it's not everybody's taste, but I love the orange/black combination</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The price, I got it at a discount, but a MSRP of €29,99 / £24.99 / US$39.99 it is a bit steep, even considering the pieces used</li><li>When playing with it, you should be a little careful pushing it down to play with the suspension because it seems to put a bit of stress on the two spring pieces at the front</li></ul>
<p>Although the two above cons, it's a very good set and lots of fun to play around with. Even for an AFOL, it's fun to ride it a bit, and play with the suspension and to see the motor block work. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I would certainly recommend this set, but you might want to wait until you find it on sale somewhere.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Duq","2013-02-09T19:46:33.7Z","Just not good enough","<p>The previous off-road bike, 8291 from 2008 was a pleasant surprise so when I saw the first pictures of a new off-roader in striking orange I knew I was going to buy the set. Oh, being a biker may also have had something to do with it...<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>As usual there's not much to say about the box; main model on the front, alternative on the back, little inset showing the play functions. The instructions are clear; a 9-year-old should have no problems with them.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Opening the box reveals 3 bags of parts, two large knobly tyres and a sticker sheet that looks like it had been intimate with one of those tyres... I've said this before: Lego put stickers and instructions in a separate bag for sets over a certain parts count. I believe they should do so for sets that have large parts that are loose in the box.</p><p>The parts are mostly what you'd expect; black studless beams, some axles and connectors in light grey and black. Surprisingly there are only 9 orange parts! Oh, and of course those gorgeous new rugged tyres.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>Building wasn't hard. You start with the engine and frame, then add rear forks, tank/panels, exhaust and front forks. The connection of the forks is using different parts than I've seen on previous bikes which is always nice to see. I was surprised to see a double gear only halfway onto an axle. Granted, it's held in place, but it's unusual.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once completed you have a bike that, like on the box, is quite striking. It's when you look closer and start playing that trouble starts...</p><p>The engine is once again an unusual type for an off-roader: a transverse V-twin. It revs slower than on the previous bike because of a 12/20 gear reduction. The gear for the rear wheel is on the outside of the forks which is odd. No brake-discs this time.</p><p>The fuel tank looks wrong; it's too low, too wide and there's nothing on top. On a positive note the number plate and mudgeard on the front look pretty good.</p><p>Technic motorbikes tend to have the same set of play functions; revving engine, steering, suspension and a stand. And here we have the biggest problem: one of those functions does not work. When you press down on the handle bars the front forks bend instead of 'telescoping in'.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Love at first sight with this bike didn't last very long. She's got those great tyres but she's lacking details. And worse: she doesn't do what it says on the tin. Err.. box.</p><p>The price has gone up about 30% since the last bike. That's a fair bit more than inflation over 5 years. The parts count has only gone up 2% or 5 parts which is bad news for value for money.</p><p>Unless you're a Technic bike collector I can't really recommend this set.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,2
"Bob_Clear","2013-12-11T22:05:38.363Z","Great set, kind of high price","<p>This set is awesome. I can't recall such a detailed motocross bike being produced by Lego, the only other one I can think of is the one from '05 or '06.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Working Pistons <br></li><li>Detail!</li><li>interesting to see how it comes together as it's different from other Technic builds</li><li>lots of useful parts for custom creations<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Hard to put tires on wheels<br></li><li>Alternate model is too similar</li><li>$39 hefty for a model this size<br></li></ul>
<p>As I said in the beginning, this set is great. It's quite different from other Technic models as it's built in an inside -&gt; out order instead of top to bottom. <br>The price is a bit high though.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"kaans","2013-08-16T21:26:58.553Z","Cute set","I have a KTM 450EXC, so this set made a lot of sense :)<br><br>The bike has double cylinders, so it's not similar to any cross bike I've seen lately<br><br>The chains aren't very smooth, however the feeling of the bike is great, the springs are really well placed.<br><br>The build is fun and the model would make a great display piece<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
