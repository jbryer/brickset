"Jskelton1994","2013-08-12T06:08:10.647Z","Really enjoyed building and racing this model","<p>'Review is by my Girlfriend as she built this model'</p>
<p>My boyfriend bought this model as well as the 42011 race car so that we could have a race to see who could build theirs the fastest. This was because I challenged him and said I would win in which he proved me wrong, as he managed to build his faster; but in my defence he&nbsp;does have&nbsp;years of experience in building lego technic models and I have hardly any. I enjoyed building my model regardless of how long it took me and the fact I couldn’t put the wheels on correctly was quite funny,&nbsp;my boyfriend&nbsp;soon helped me fix that as he knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>I think the instructions could therefore be a bit more clearer on how to put the wheels together and which way they should go on the model. </p>
<p>When it came to us having a race between the two models I say I won but my boyfriend says he won. We both know I won and my model made it to the finish line first; his model didn’t even go in a straight line and veered off course past where the finish line actually was. </p>
<p>no sabotage i promise ;)</p>
<p><br/>Overall I really enjoyed building and racing my model and would recommend buying&nbsp;it to anyone.<br/></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Pretty heavy box, wheels cause this mainly. Good manual, only one. The combined racer you can build if you have the 42011 is burried as PDF on the Lego site.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set has great parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 mini blue wing panels (2x5)</li>
	<li>4 black wing panels (3x5 and 3x7)</li>
	<li>4 3x7 angled blue beams and a bunch of other blue liftarms</li>
	<li>a worm wheel (for the combined model)</li>
	<li>a lot of angled black connectors</li>
	<li>black 56145 Rim Wide W.Cross 30/20 rims (always needed to upgrade models with grey rims)</li>
	<li>6 pieces of 10197 Beam 1M W. 2 Cross Axles 90&deg;. I did not know this piece: very handy!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>This off road racer looks simply stunning. Leave the stickers off, it is perfect without them. The black with blue accents is very very cool, and the nice red accents (chair and wheel fixings) finish it. It is a big pitty this model does not combine with the other killer model of the series, the 42026 Black Champion Racer. Now you have to buy the two way inferior cars (42011 and 42027) as well to make one of the combo-racers.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The pull back racers are not hard to build. IMO, these Technic sets are the best LEGO after the kids finish the DUPLO years. It is way more inviting to 4 year olds than LEGO City for example. My kid build it with no assistance in understanding the instructions. Only hard part is when one beam has to be stuck on 4 pins in a row. These are the only moments when dad comes in.</p>

<p>With Lego city you get tons of tiny pieces, in zillion colours and shapes, that fall apart when playing all the time, and allow close to 0 other things to build with them. Technic sets like this invite to fantasy vehicles over and over and over again. So my suggestion as parent: DUPLO --&gt; Technic</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The 42010 is an excellent pull-back racer. It gives a lot of fun, and the 2 year old can play perfectly with the builder. They drive back and forth with lots of laughs. The model is sturdy, only the roof is a little flimsy and gets loose now and then. The roof can be opened a full 90 degrees, much more realistic than the roof on the 42027 which hardly opens.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Lego&#39;s Technic pull-back racers are the BEST advertisement Lego has to offer. These cars make kids want more Technic and get rid of their Duplo. Grab this 42010 or the equally great 42026 Black Champion Racer. Skip the 42011 or 42027 unless the kids have a big urge to build the combined models. Next up: Mindstorms</p>
