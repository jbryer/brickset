"tkettle9719","2013-01-19T20:16:16.897Z","Zoooooooom!","<p>I got this set with my most recent purchase from shop.lego.com, and I must say that this is an excellent reintroduction to Technic after almost a six-year break from the theme. I am glad to get this set (though my wallet might not be)&nbsp; because it has sparked a new love of Technic for me. This is an excellent example of what I want in my Technic sets. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>One of my big problems with Technic is that sometimes models seem very skeletal or incomplete, maybe more suited towards a frame that could be surrounded by System pieces; the case is not applicable here. It's solid and looks almost final. <br></li><li>I just love how this car looks; the design is clean and simple, but it's so beautiful that it caught my eye like no Technic set had in years. Also, the design revolves around the excellent pull back engine, which makes it have an even better sign. <br></li><li>I'm also in love with the color scheme here; red is a classic race car color, and this particular red is the correct embodiment of a race car.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons<br></h4>
<ul><li>Oh, stickers; usually, I'm fine with stickers in small amounts (with the exception of Exo-Force - but I was too young to really care since they were my first Lego sets with stickers), but twelve stickers in a 20 dollar set is a bit much for my tastes; however, they do have detail, so I'm fine with it. <br></li><li>I also am not a fan of the bottom of the set; although it looks excellent, there is a gap in the middle of the floor which really annoys me, but this is minor. <br></li><li>I also know that this is extremely minor, but I do wish that the steering wheel was a full circle rather than the piece given here, but, like the other cons, I don't find it all that necessary. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent reintroduction to the Technic line; it's inexpensive, it looks very solid compared to some skeletal models, and it is made for kids. I think that this set is an excellent reason to buy Technic and skip some System sets; this is far more awesome than just a standard Lego race car because it is a Technic set. IF you have the chance, get this set. Kids and adults will love it. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"S_Tac_Warrior_","2013-02-21T21:00:48.71Z","Go forth with the pull-back! ","<p>The review that was written earlier by Bobszaar pretty much covered all the main pros and cons to this set. I just got around to build it, and I thought I would add a little more of what I think of this set.&nbsp;</p><p>The design of this set is very neat. It packs quite a lot of details into such a small set. The low ground clearance and the super-low profile rear tires are what really attracted me. Talking about low profile tires, I like how they included two different sizes for the front and rear tires (I know race cars are supposed to have larger rear tires, but some sets will just put in four of the same sized tires). The pull-back motor is also a great piece.</p><p>The low ground clearance can prove to be a pain if you want to push the set around on carpet as it get snagged with all the crud you have on your carpet (my carpet is really dirty :( ). The lack of a second model and very (and I mean VERY) limited playability are the main drawbacks of this set. Steering would be such a welcoming addition. I also feel that the price is a little bit high. One last con of this set is the little red tube that is put in front. Personally, I do not like to bend the tube back every time I want it to be straight again. They should have included a more flexible piece.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, I think the earlier review talked about all the technical points of this set. My review is more of what I think about it. It is a pretty cool set, I can tell you that, but if you were to pick this up, I suggest you should find a deal on it or wait till the price goes down (hopefully). Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

<p>These two models were fantastic fun to build and race, even for me as a relatively experienced lego technic builder. Quite nice to look at too, so would compliment a LEGO collection nicely.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;little bit pricy for both of them, but good in a sale like '2 for 1'. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Matthias_K","2016-10-30T22:51:00.04Z","Vrooom!","<p>I never had a set with a pullback motor before and selected this set to try it. I was surprised by the power of the pullback motor and by the great look the designer managed to get out of so few parts.</p>

<p>A small downside of this set is that the pullback motor is the only function on the car, but that&#39;s&nbsp;understandable at this scale. A bigger downside (and a bit of a dissapointment)&nbsp;is that there is no B model available for this set at all.</p>
