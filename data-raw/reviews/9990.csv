At first glance I was disappointed seeing that the vehicles are build on full wheel platforms but then I realized this is actually an advantage, leaving more space in the piece count for more interesting pieces. And indeed the set shines by it&#39;s little pieces and the great playability value. My kid is involving the cars in a lot of stunts scenarios ending in crushed cars and injured minifigs - the spikes and flames really help in this regard... :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are miserable. Absolutely the worst building instructions I ever seen in a Lego set. That is because they claim they enclosed &quot;easy to build&quot; instructions printed on three small cardboard cards. On each of the little cards it is explained in a very brief way how to assemble one of the three car models. It is very hard to spot the details and on one model (the red one) it is impossible to see how to build the back end part. I was lucky to see the completed model in the pictures posted on brickset and I finally completed the model properly.</p>

<p>The only excuse for the miserable instructions is that the set is intended to make the kids explore various free builds using imagination rather than just build following the instructions. On the box there are other build models showcased but there are no instructions enclosed for them, thus implying that you have to free build when playing with this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is some significant number of parts that are not used in the actual models built using the instructions. The set is intended to provoke you to use the remaining pieces to modify the existing models or to create various stunts settings.</p>

<p>I found some various parts quite interesting, but nothing to die for. For instance the parts composing the crane of the tow vehicle and the micro turntable. Also you will get a trophy cup, some flags, a chain...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three victims, err... I mean minifigs:<br />
- a pilot with black suit and helmet that has two faces printed on it&#39;s head;<br />
- some sort of a stunts driver with red suit but a hat instead of a proper helmet;<br />
- a repair and maintenance guy (or saboteur) that drives the tow vehicle.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun if you make up the builds but frustrating if you try to follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Simply fun to play. It is perfect for kids but nothing to see for AFOLs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good for the purpose.</p>
