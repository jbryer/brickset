The box consists of 88 parts plus 7 extras. With it you can build hurdles used in equestrian sports or some bedroom furniture for the princess minifig that is included. Or anything else you can imagine given the array of bricks and small parts that are included.<br></p><p>The set is labelled 'for young builders' with the additions <i>easy to build</i> and <i>inspiration included</i>. The latter refers to the small folded booklet which indeed gives the young builder at least 8 different options for building a thing.</p><p><b>Minifig</b></p><p>The minifig included is a princess from the Castle theme and doesn't appear in any other sets. Special about her is that you can build her with either black legs or with a dress. Nice feature!<br></p><p><b>Notable parts</b></p><p>Parts you may like especially are the pearl gold window panes latticed, the horse with moveable legs and the 12 (!) round 1 x 1 plate with flower edge. You also get a carrot and a hairbrush. And of course many bricks and plates in the Friends colour scheme.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Price per piece ratio<br></li><li>Nice colours: bright pink, dark pink, medium azure, lime<br></li><li>Minifig<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Couldn't find any cons, but the least useful brick is probably the 2 x 4 x 3 window frame. Any AFOL using that brick today?<br></li></ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Buy it for the parts especially when you like the Friends theme.<br></p><p>So this was my very first review. I chose this set to practise... and hope you like it nevertheless ;-) <br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,5

I thought my 6-year-old, who is not totally out of the princess stage, would be excited about it, but she thought the princess in this set -- being a traditional LEGO minifigure -- looked ""weird"". It sort of makes sense, since the only LEGO figures she knows are Friends mini-dolls. I can see her point there. I know there was a revolt of the traditionalists againt the mini-dolls, but let's face it, they are cute.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The set was thus given to the yonger daughter who has had blast (having dabbled in DUPLO already) assembing and reassembling it according to the instruction booklet and her own imagination.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I have not seen the girls play with the assembled set much, probably because it does not stay assembled for very long.
