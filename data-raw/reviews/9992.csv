"T79","2014-04-25T13:15:49.107Z","A crane! Now I want the excavator! Now the cherry picker!","<p>The first lego my children received, and no review yet so why don&#39;t I try one? It&#39;s obviously very basic so I&#39;m rating this&nbsp;with (very)&nbsp;young children in mind.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very nice, made from sturdy cardboard and the lid&nbsp;serves as&nbsp;a baseplate. Tiny parts can get stuck under the flaps on the bottom though but some tape can solve that. The instructions are very basic, just 2 or 3 steps for each vehicle, and leaving some things to be inferred rather than being outright shown in steps. Rather annoying for me at first&nbsp;but then again, this might be a way to foster creativity so&nbsp;you <em>cannot just follow instructions</em> so actually a good move!</p>

<p>One thing though, the instructions can&#39;t stand up to the handling of a young child, much less two...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A wide variety of parts to create an equally wide variety of construction vehicles. It&#39;s not a big set but there is a good variation of colours and parts here. Favourites are of course the digger bucket and the crane, but there are some nice printed parts (no stickers) and utensils (crate! jackhammer!) too. While the car chassis part is big and a bit limiting it does make it easier for young children to actually create something, the only real downside is that there is no other set of wheels so you&#39;re limited to one truck at a time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just one, a (surprise) construction worker in orange with reflective stripes, definitely a step up from the blue coverall with white pockets of my childhood but nothing fancy although it fits the set well enough and more is not really needed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple enough that with a little guidance a 4 year old child can build away, the results aren&#39;t much to look at but that doesn&#39;t matter in this case, all vehicles are recognizable and playable:</p>

<p>1) a truck (a dump truck is missing and would be easy to do by adding some hinges) and crane with a &#39;house&#39; (a wall with a door) under construction</p>

<p>2) an excavator</p>

<p>3) a cherry picker and a lantern post to be fixed (with... a hammer?)</p>

<p>4) a cement or asphalt&nbsp;mixer</p>

<p>5) a dozer</p>

<p>and some assorted items like traffic cones, signs, a service station&nbsp;etc.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I said, nothing fancy. But the point here is not to have a beautifully detailed model but something easy to create, play with and take it apart again to make something else (or, more accurately, have dad make something else). Some items shown are enough to fire their imagination and don&#39;t really need a build, like the worker fixing a road with some cones and plants or debris spread around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With some young children around fascinated by construction equipment this set is very much a hit, and later on it would still serve as a parts pack to create better things with it so just a few parts away from perfection (as seen through a 4-year-old&#39;s eyes;)!</p>
