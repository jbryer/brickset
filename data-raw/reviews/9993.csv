It's priced very nicely, well below the retail for City vehicles and even the smallest themed sets. The set includes a good variety of basic and specialised pieces and an 'inspiration' book which shows how to build a fire truck, a helicopter, a hot rod with flames out the back (great appeal for the rev-heads there) and a windmill. It's a little ironic that the instructions aimed at very young builders contain fewer steps for each model, which is what some AFOLs request in more complex Lego sets!<div><br>The 'Fire Station' is pretty much just an archway built from 2 x 2 and 2 x 4 bricks, with a speaker/retro rocket piece, and the young builder can also make some bushes out of green and brown 2 x 2 bricks, and set them on fire with transparent orange flame pieces and 1 x 1 cones. I was able to make a fire engine resembling the one on the box, and what I decided was a cell phone tower, on fire of course, to use up the rest of the pieces.<div><br></div><div>The minifigure is a smartly printed fire fighter (front of torso only) with a very professional expression on his face and a silver helmet. He comes with the new style of dog, with printed body. I am confident that any fires in my Lego town will be put out smartly and safely!</div><div><br></div><div>The main thing that makes or breaks this kit for AFOL parents is the chassis piece. It's a 4 x 8 chassis in red, with wheel arches and axles all moulded in one. It makes it very easy to build a truck or car, but in only one size. This set is marketed at first builders of Lego, so it's not a bad thing, but it means that the young builders aren't coming up with ways to make vehicles by themselves.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, it's a great selection of pieces, including a nice fire fighter and dog, but that chassis limits possibilities for vehicle construction. The box shows the pieces and possibilities very clearly and should help you decide whether it's suitable.</div></div>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4
