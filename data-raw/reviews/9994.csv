<p>Today I take a look at the smallest, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79106-1"" title=""View set details"">79106</a>: Cavalry Builder Set which consists of four minifigs including the Lone Ranger and Silver, left, a cannon and a few other bits and bobs.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>The front of the box looks fantastic The red logo, yellow header and blue minifigs really make it &#39;pop&#39; and should make it jump off the shelf.</p>

<p>Inside, there are two bags of parts, one instruction manual and a new style poseable back-leg horse. Is this the first time it&#39;s appeared in white? I&#39;m not sure, because for some reason the horse is always missing from LEGO&#39;s set inventories so I can&#39;t look up the details. Let me know in the comments if you&#39;re a LEGO&nbsp;equine expert!</p>

<p>There are a couple of new parts: (1)&nbsp;the pistols which look a whole lot better than previous versions. They come in two colours: the Lone Ranger has two silver ones, and one of the cavalry has a gun-metal one, which has come out looking more like black in the photo below but is actually metallic. The set also contains two spares, one of each, and&nbsp;(2) the Lone Ranger&#39;s stetson, see below.</p>

<h2>The minifigs</h2>

<p>The set contains three cavalrymen and the Lone Ranger, below. As you can see his torso is very detailed, and&nbsp;his jacket and waistcoat extend onto his legs. The <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8567832129/in/set-72157633022681233"">back of the torso is also printed</a>. Onm first glance his hat looks the same as the old stetson, but it actually has a slightly wider brim: about 1mm diamater larger, and no bow on the side.</p>

<p>When I was at the Toy Fair in January the guy showing the Lone Ranger&nbsp;sets said that the LR fig would be different in every set, but from what I can see from the sets in my possession, there are only two variants: this one, and one with a&nbsp;different head -- sporting a &#39;grimace&#39; --&nbsp;in the mine set.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8568929746/"" title=""79106 Lone Ranger Cavalry Builder Set by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79106 Lone Ranger Cavalry Builder Set"" height=""500"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8568929746_dde7353a80.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The cavalry share the same torso, which is also <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8568930156/in/set-72157633022681233/"">printed on the back</a>, but have different heads. One comes with a pistol and messenger bag, the other two have rifles and back packs. None have double-sided heads because, obviously, it would not be obscured by their hats.</p>

<p>This one&nbsp;(the leader?)&nbsp; also has a telescope. The hats are the same as those used in the 1996 Western sets, but are dark blue instead of normal blue. The figs look great, don&#39;t they...</p>

<h2>The rest of the set</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll mainly be buying this for the figs, but the rest of the set is fairly interesting and useful:&nbsp;it features a small section of wall to sheter behind, a camp-fire with chicken leg, and...</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>This is&nbsp;a great introduction to the Lone Ranger theme. The minifigs are, as we&#39;ve come to expect lately, superb, and the rest of the set is pretty good too.</p>

<p>It was probably sensible from a marketing point of view&nbsp;to put the Lone Ranger in the smallest set, but&nbsp;given that it&#39;s being pitched as a &#39;cavalry builder set&#39;, if you buy multiples you&#39;ll obviously&nbsp;end up with a surfeit of Lone Rangers. Maybe it would have been better to have four cavalrymen instead.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will review <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79107-1"" title=""View set details"">79107</a> Commanche Camp <em>(and I&#39;ll take more care at removing the pesky spots on the images caused by dust on the sensor and shooting at f32: they aren&#39;t visible at normal&nbsp;apertures)</em></p>

<p>What do you think? Are you looking forward to these sets coming out?</p>

"Branko","2013-05-17T00:21:40.747Z","Great army builder, but not much of a building set.","<p>It's hard to give a single rating for this set because it depends how you look at it. As a minifigure collection or as a Lego construction set. <br></p><p>The minifigures are very nice and the finished set looks nice and just asks to be played with so it nails it in that regard. It's a pity there isn't an army officer instead of the Lone Range but I'm sure that has to do with the movie tie-in.</p><p>There isn't much to build in this set which, for me, limits its value as a Lego set.<br></p><p><b>Pros</b>
</p><ul><li>Very nice minifigures that are all a little bit different despite being essentially the same soldiers.<br></li><li>Accessories; cannon, horse chicken, fireplace, wall</li><li>Nice play experience (who doesn't love a shooting cannon?)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not much to build, it's just a minifigure pack (not really a con if you are looking for that)<br></li><li>No officer but a Lone Ranger instead.</li></ul>
<p>If you are looking for some Lego building experience this set isn't really a good idea. If you are looking for a nice group of minifigures with some accessories, or ways to expand your Western army this is a great purchase. The figures look very good and the decorations make it a well rounded kit.</p><p>As army builder I would rate this at 5/5 (reflected in my parts and playability rating), as generic Lego set I cannot rate it higher than 4/5.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
"Lint","2013-06-20T05:39:45Z","After many long years LEGO delivers a decent army builder once again","<h4>The Skinny</h4><p>The title of my review is not quite true, Lego has been consistently putting out army builders in the Star Wars line year by year, however that set this Cavalry Builder Set beats recent Star Wars army builders hands down. In this set you get three American Cavalrymen, The Lone Ranger, his horse Silver, a stockade wall and a firing cannon.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Love the new wild west pistols. They are far better than the classic lego six shooters which look very cartoony. Also they are cast in beautiful gunmetal for the soldiers and metallic silver for the Lone Ranger.<br></li><li>A great assortment of wild west parts plus a generous amount of spare parts, one spare rifle, two spare pistols of each colour, clear circle stud, flame and 'cannonball'.<br></li><li>A cannon! In beautiful gunmetal grey!</li><li>One of those new design horses! I love em.<br></li><li>You get three soldiers with identical uniforms. They really look the part and are printed on both sides. Snazzy!</li><li>The stockade wall is simple yet does the trick. Lining these up with other walls and cannons would look like a real battle line.</li><li>Playability=maximum<br></li><li>Overall great value for what you pay.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Building experience is next to nil<br></li><li>If you were doing this to army build soliders you would end up with a lot of Lone Rangers. It's understandable why he is included but as others have said, an 'officer' fig would have been much more 'useful'.</li><li>This will sound petty but the black wheels for the cannon are neither historically accurate nor good looking... *quick google images search* ... oh they are historically accurate. Well it still looks awful!</li><li>This will sound even pettier but if it's a <b>Cavalry</b> builder set, shouldn't these guys be the one with horse/s?<br></li><li>If you're going by price per piece this one is on the hefty side.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Conclusion<br></h4><p>Overall this is great army builder set outside of Star Wars, the last one I remember was the green army men from Toy Story. Although I have made a longer cons list than I usually do, the set is still worth the buy for the cannon, the horse and the extra weapons. A must buy for Wild West builders and a worthy recommendation to parents looking for something fun to buy the kids after the movie while on a budget. Although knowing Johnny Depp they're probably gonna want a Tonto minfiig as well.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-21T19:37:40.113Z","HI HO SILVER, AWAY","<p><strong>Set # 79106 Cavalry Builder Set: </strong>The Lone Ranger, a fun and exciting film from Disney that re-introduced another classic LEGO Theme to the world of LEGO collectors just as it tried to re-introduce a classic movie Theme to the world of film audiences in a modern setting. High speed, action packed westerns.</p>
<p>This is the introductory set, it's priced at 17.99$ in Canada, a terrible price for a battle pack even if it does include the Lone Ranger's horse. However it is to be expected as not all licensed products can follow the Star Wars model of pricing. On to the Pros and Cons of the set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheapest method of obtaining the Lone Ranger and his horse, only available in this set and Constitution Train Chase. 
<li>The Mini-Figures in this set are very impressive, the three Cavalry soldiers are a vast upgrade from the older Western Theme of LEGO with their impressive printed detail work and accessories. The Lone Ranger is also a great looking print and Mini-Figure, a shame he's in every single set except one polybag. 
<li>New revolver sculpt accessories for the Mini-Figures in this Theme are a real improvement, they look great and even more realistic/accurate to the design of the real weapon. It's a great new piece and this set includes about four of them. 
<li>Printed flag piece hasn't been seen in ages and it looks great. Including a cannon is a nice play feature and the small outpost build works for what it is.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The build is a bit on the small/mediocre side compared to other Battle Packs. I half expect to find more in these types of sets, considering the piece count is only 69 pieces though I'm not too surprised. 
<li>Army building with this set means you get a slew of Lone Rangers and Silver, a bit unfortunate as this Mini-Figure, while excellently detailed and fun is abundant in all of the other larger sets so most collectors aren't really in the market for one.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I find this set to be a pretty decent one if you only buy one of it, it's a great way to get three Cavalry Soldiers and a Lone Ranger Mini-Figure, plus it is a cheaper method of purchasing Silver, the Lone Ranger's horse.</p>
<p>On the down side, this is a pretty poor excuse for an army builder set, it includes The Lone Ranger. Making an army of him even more insane than it currently is in the Theme, also the price. For the number of pieces in the set the asking price is a bit high, considering in the US it costs 12.99$ marking it up to 17.99$ for us Canadians seems like a big high of an MSRP. Just because it has a horse doesn't mean it should cost so much, even when the licensing fee is taken into consideration. I mean the Castle set at this price range has a horse in it too if memory serves and it only costs 14.99$ CND, I'd have preferred if this was at least 15.99$ for what it is.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of this Theme, a huge fan, I'm going to say this is still a solid recommended, if you're only interested in having a Lone Ranger Mini-Figure with his horse this is also worth picking up compared to the Constituation Train Chase. If you aren't looking to have everything from the Theme or just aren't into the price it's an easy pass.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

"Galaxy12_Import","2020-07-30T03:31:19.147Z","Battle Pack that sets the Example","<p>The Minifigure Battlepack has become a standard of any respectable LEGO theme that features background characters in some kind of uniform, aligned either with or against the main characters in the theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cavalry Builder set offers three uniformed Civil War soldiers and a Lone Ranger Figure to lend playability. Adding in the Canon, Horse, and Palisade justifies the expected $13 price point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of release, the horse assembly was still somewhat novel. Earth Blue and Sand Blue have been used to elevate the realism and each soldier has a unique face print. With backpacks, a saddle bag, printed flag element, and chicken cooking on the fire this is an army builder that exemplifies what this type of set should be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of July 2020, used copies of the set can pull in $25, double the original cost even in played-with condition. This is thanks to the minifigures for the most part, but try selling without the horse + canon and the value will drop. To me this shows that even just a few well-chosen support minibuilds can bring lasting value to battle packs; finding a middle ground between a box of minifigs and four figs with large supporting builds that are marketed as a battle pack (I&#39;m looking at you, 501st clone troopers).</p>
