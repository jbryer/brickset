I got it on sale at Target for the ""sale"" price of $30 or so. Hi-ho Silver, away!<div><br></div><div>MINIFIGS</div><div>For what is presumably a one-off, one-season theme, LEGO have rendered a fascinating amount of detail in the characters. All three minifigures merit front, back and leg printing. The Lone Ranger himself gets a brand new hat mould -extra-wide brimmed in comparison to LEGO's last notable effort, the Indy fedora - and new guns in the form of the chrome silver revolvers. Tonto steals the spotlight with a brand new, unprecedented hair-piece that I feel was adapted from the Jack Sparrow hair-piece from the POTC line. He has a brand-new crow mould to sit atop his head, but goodness knows why. The last minifigure is Red Knee, a (presumable) ally of Tonto. This Comanche has a lovely buffalo headdress, printed and all, and a half-red face that sets him apart from white-faced Tonto. I wish the set had come with perhaps a tribal elder as such to help it FEEL like a camp, but Red Knee does fine.<br>I realise that people will tire of the Ranger and his being in every set (The dreaded Sparrow Syndrome, methinks), but if you want one reasonably cheap set in which to nab the two target pop culture heroes, this is one of the best. 4/5</div><div><br></div><div>PARTS</div><div>For such a small set, the designers really did squeeze a lot of bits in. You get three of the new pearl silver revolvers, a brand new tomahawk, three scorpions (as a child of the Adventurers and Western themes, I do love the LEGO scorpions), a fish, a bow and arrow, a spear, an oar and a canoe to keep it in. There's also three bones which are a new part I've not seen in a while, and a good amount of tan and cream coloured bricks which are among the more useful colours in the LEGO palette. There's one blue piece on the weapon rack that seems rather distracting, though. You might replace it. 4/5<br><br>BUILDING</div><div>There's not a lot to this set. The teepee is a twice-built design, and fairly unengaging. The same goes for the rock/scorpion nest and the weapon rack. A lot of the more challenging designs I believe are in the more expensive sets like the railroad and the gold mine. 3/5<br><br>GIMMICKS</div><div>Now just WHY is the rock mound lodging scorpions at the Lone Ranger? I've not seen the movie, admittedly, but this set could have been a nice 'good guys' diorama or scene without the need to put in action launchers in the scorpion nest. 2/5<br><br>OVERALL</div><div>If you're looking for one set that defines LEGO's offering for The Lone Ranger, look elsewhere, probably to the train-set. If you want a small, unobtrusive set that combines our two heroes in an affordable package with lots of small extras, this set is all that. 13/20</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-25T11:32:33.65Z","Return of the Teepee","<p><strong>Set #79107 Comanche Camp: </strong>This set is fairly unusual. It doesn't have as much building as you might expect and it includes a piece that looks really impressive and captures the authenticity of the film's teepee pretty nicely. And for the price it's not too bad, unfortunately there are a few things I have to say about this set so let's move on shall we?</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Lone Ranger boxes have an interesting design choice, the images of the set are broken up by a sort of tearing feature... This means that it looks like an old world piece of paper that's been partially damaged. I think the design is pretty cool honestly, it certainly stands out from other LEGO Themes as something unique on the shelf. There aren't really too many play features for this set, so the images on the back are more like those found on Classic LEGO boxes, which is also kind of fun. You get to see fun play scenes being acted out by the LEGO Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>The instructions are a great design too, with a simple to follow step-by-step build and piece list. Unfortunately that's about it, LEGO did not include Mini-Figure checklists on any of these sets, and the cross-promotional images in the back are reduced considerably only showing the webpage for this Theme. It's a bit lacking honestly and I am a little dissapointed that they didn't include the Mini-Figure checklists like other licensed Themes have.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Not a load of parts in this set that stand out for me, obviously the canoe is a great piece. I'm not positive if this is brand new or if it's an old piece being brought back for this Theme, all I know is it's great to see it and a big draw for MOC enthusiasts I'm sure. The Teepee piece is a thin bit of plastic that looks much better than the old cardboard roof I had on Hagrid's Hut. (Er, sorry that's the only piece I've ever owned from another Theme that is similar to this type of piece.)</p>
<p>The only other thing I can say about the pieces in this set is that there are a lot of tan. And other desert coloured pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Here's where I start to get a little rantish. Ok, I understand that the main characters of the film have to appear in a load of sets, case in point every set features The Lone Ranger himself and almost all of them have Tonto. That being said, with a name like Comanche Camp there should at least be more than one Comanche Warrior.</p>
<p>Tonto is Johnny Depp in LEGO form for the second time. He's got a decent looking print with a great double-sided torso and leg printing matching the costume worn in the film very nicely. He's got a double-sided face, as the box shows, with a scared expression on one side and a normal expression on the other. Accessories are limited, he's got the new tomahawk piece from the CMF line and a great looking hair piece with a spot to put his crow. He's a great Mini-Figure and even if his hair does look kind of similar to Jack Sparrow it isn't a big problem.</p>
<p>Red Knee is a Comanche from the film who I can't really remember a lot about at the moment, I haven't seen the movie since summer. He's got a nice print too that looks similar to Tonto's, they share similar details though they are not of the same tribe. He has a double-sided torso which shows off his back muscles and leg printing. He also has a double-sided face with a normal expression and a scared expression. And he's wearing a brand new sculpted head piece&nbsp;that reminds me of a tribal shaman. His accessories include a quiver, a bow and a spear.</p>
<p>The Lone Ranger... I just hate this Mini-Figure's inclusion here, he's not a bad mini-fig, far from it he's got excellent detail and looks awesome with his double-sided torso print, the leg printing the new cowboy hat accessory and the two silver pistols which are brand new sculpted western weapons. My main gripe with his inclusion in this set is that he's in every set, every single Lone Ranger set has The Lone Ranger, and I think this particular set would have been better suited to feature his alter-ego. The lawyer, what's his name, I don't... Yeah I can't remember his name right now, all I know is he isn't available in any of the sets. Not a single set from this Theme features the Lone Ranger <strong>without </strong>his mask on. Why is that LEGO? Why is it that fans of the Theme and kids especially can't play with the set and have the Lone Ranger run off and disguise himself as his alternate persona? Batman has Bruce Wayne, Iron Man has Tony Stark even Superman has a Clark Kent Mini-Fig exclusive, but the Lone Ranger has nothing.</p>
<p>One scene in the film at the Comanche Camp did in fact involve his alter ego if memory serves, why not include him as the third Mini-Fig in this set? It would have been a welcome change, it isn't like you can't find The Lone Ranger in any other set. He's everywhere, he's even in a Polybag if you're lucky enough to find that one. I'm sorry LEGO, in this instant I feel that you dropped the ball.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>You don't actually build the Teepee in this set, there's a few things to build for the interior, however the single softer plastic piece that is used for the vast majority of the actual teepee is just a snap it into place to mold around the Technic beams and then bang, you've got a teepee. For fans of brick built structures this may be a big dissapointment, personally I think that a structure of this type should have limited build.</p>
<p>The large rock promontory and small weapon stand make up the bulk of the build, and I have to say this is some satisfying work. Even if it is a bit play feature heavy for this type of LEGO set.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Let's just get this out of the way first, the rock with desert brush thing, it's a hollow build with a flick-scorpion launching gimmic. Yep, even though this never happened in the movie in order to add a play feature to this set LEGO included a sorpion launching device hidden in a large rock structure. It's not bad, the LEGO Scorpion is such a fun piece I never get tired of it, unfortunately the added play feature to the set is kind of silly.</p>
<p>The small weapon stand works for what it is, I like it, it's simple, fun and does what is's supposed to do.</p>
<p>The teepee however is just all around fun, I love the way this thing is actually built using such limited pieces. The inside has a small cooking area with a fish being prepared for a meal and some room for the Mini-Figs to sit around to discuss events from the film. Then there's the long Technic beams and poles that connect together quite cleverly to hold the moldable plastic teepee in place. All around I really like the function and look of this build, it works so well I'm glad they didn't try to do this all with bricks.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall my thoughts on this set... It's ok, definitely worth picking up for the model and the canoe, even Tonto and Red Knee are great to have in this set. I could have done with more actual Comanche in this Comanche Camp, to keep the price point low I suspect including more than three Mini-Figures was asking too much.</p>
<p>And boy do I really hate the fact that LEGO didn't use this set to give us a Lone Ranger without his mask and in his other outfit. Seriously, we've got the Lone Ranger's brother Dan Ried, we've got his sister-in-law and his nephew in the Constitution Train Chase, but we don't get him without the mask and getup? Such wasted opportunity here. And as I said it isn't that he's a bad Mini-Figure, it's that he's in every set except Tonto's Campfire Polybag, so why not try to at least give us some variety?</p>
<p>Recommended for fans of the Western LEGO Theme, you might want to even try and find some extra teepee and canoes from Bricklink or similar sites in order to MOC a true Comanche Camp. (You'll have to MOC your own custom Comanche Warriors and stuff though.) Great overall set, just some minor complaints.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"2015LiveLong_Prosper","2015-08-14T17:38:00.393Z","All-In-One Wild West Set","<p>I got this set back in 2013, it took me two years to finally getting around to writing a review. So, here it is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD</p>

<p>(Although it probably won&#39;t matter, the movie was so bad.)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box: simple, and illustrating the set&#39;s features and functions. A normal size for a 19.99 USD set.</p>

<p>The instructions: One booklet, and that was it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts: For me, the highlight of this set was the teepee. The piece is great, the plastic is kind of&nbsp;bendy and the decals were printed, no stickers in this set. :)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Lone Ranger: I liked this minifigure for his face, hat and torso, but I feel something is missing and I can&#39;t tell what. That lowered my opinion of the minifigure. The hat and pistols were new to that theme.</p>

<p>Tonto: Perfect. Just perfect. The printing, the bird on his head, the frightened expression, perfect.</p>

<p>Red Knee: This minifigure wasn&#39;t bad, the hair piece was cool and the head adequate. It was more of a &quot;meh&quot; minifigure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A quick build, 15 minutes or so.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model was...interesting, to say the least, with a teepee, a weapons rack, and a scorpion flinging rock. That last bit is what peeved me. If I remember correctly, and I&#39;m sure I do, Tonto and Mr. Ranger were buried up to their necks in sand and then the scorpions came clik-clakking. And who put them there in the first place? Red Knee and his cronies. That was the movie. Now, the set. All of them standing ON the ground, fleeing for cover and firing bullets as scorpions fly out of a rock. Hmm. Don&#39;t remember that happening.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set was cool, but it would&#39;ve been better if they swapped the cata-rock for a thing which you could place Tonto and Lone Ranger in and if they included the horse to pull them out. Overall, a pretty decent set. It got everything the wild west needs. A cowboy, some native americans, a teepee, and a rock.&nbsp;</p>
