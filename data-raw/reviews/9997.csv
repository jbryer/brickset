<p>It features a bank and sheriff&#39;s office/jail, five minifigs, and a whole host of interesting features and parts.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>Another brightly coloured and attractive image graces the front of the box.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577733996/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""336"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8577733996_9699c43931.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The back, as usual, shows what moves and what comes off, and ideas for playing with the set.</p>

<p>Inside are four numbered bags, two instruction manuals, an 8 x 16 plate and a sticker sheet.</p>

<h2>The minifigs</h2>

<p>The are five minifigs in the set: The Lone Ranger, Tonto, Dan Reid, Frank and Ray. The Lone Ranger and Tonto are the same as those in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79107-1"" title=""View set details"">79107</a> Comanche Camp and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79106-1"" title=""View set details"">79106</a> Cavalry Builder set, so I won&#39;t say much about them again.</p>

<p>Dan Reid, or Captain Daniel Reid, is a captain in the Texas Rangers, and it seems is&nbsp;the Lone Ranger&#39;s brother (so I&#39;ve just found out on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Ranger"">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>This is Ray, who is not mentioned in the Wikipedia article so I have no idea who he is, but he&#39;s probably an outlaw. His hat&nbsp;is a grey version of&nbsp;that worn&nbsp;by&nbsp;the<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8805-9""> <span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span>small&nbsp;clown</a>&nbsp;in series five of the collectable minifigs. His clothes look like they&#39;ve seen better days...</p>

<p>Finally we have Frank, who&#39;s definitely an outlaw because he&#39;s seen with the &#39;swag&#39; on the front of the box :-)</p>

<h2>The sack!</h2>

<p>The set contains a&nbsp;swag bag which, I&#39;ve just been informed in the comments, was carried by Santa in collectable minifigs series 8.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577738764/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""442"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8577738764_0cb632e130.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>There are no presents in this one, though: Frank uses it to carry booty robbed from the bank.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576637873/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8576637873_1b9b41b55f.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 558px;"" /></a></p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The model consists of two buildings and a couple of accessories. The sheriff&#39;s office and jail are constructed first.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576633657/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""403"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8576633657_722215717d.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The office area.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576633845/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""312"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8524/8576633845_c519df1866.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The completed model, with two stickers applied. There are others,&nbsp; for detail on the roof slopes but given it would be difficult&nbsp;to get them on straight I didn&#39;t bother.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576634065/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""384"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8576634065_14c9848b51.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Round the back, showing a hidden roof-mounted cannon...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577735382/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""401"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8577735382_2fd1d7e802.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>...that hinges down. Note how it&#39;s mounted back-to-front on its base. The front of the jail can be ejected using a rod on the back.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577735628/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""493"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8577735628_c14c630d8e.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the front of the bank under construction.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576634677/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""352"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8576634677_4b0522e41e.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Not much to it yet...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576634849/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""375"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8576634849_65da6f31e1.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The completed &#39;building&#39;. It&#39;s not really much of a building, more just a facade. But it&#39;s quite well designed and from the front it looks good.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576635065/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""454"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8576635065_5f037ea2b6.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>It looks a bit unfinished on the right-hand side, though.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576635275/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8576635275_86b1427018.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 579px;"" /></a></p>

<p>Round the back, with the safe installed.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576635483/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""485"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8576635483_f0b242d742.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the &#39;swag&#39; that&#39;s in the safe:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8576637333/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""351"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8576637333_d8bec48812.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Rather conveniently for Frank and his outlaw gang, there&#39;s a lever on the side of the safe that ejects the front wall of the building.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577736714/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""358"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8577736714_cacfddd510.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>This must be Frank&#39;s getaway vehicle :-) Note the medium nougat crate. There&#39;s another one on the roof of the sheriff&#39;s office.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the completed model, everything in the box except for the minifig weapons, which&nbsp;are the usual assortment of rifles, pistols and tomahawks.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8577736862/"" title=""79109 Colby City Showdown by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79109 Colby City Showdown"" height=""265"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8577736862_21e791f102.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>Another pretty good model then, in the Lone Ranger theme. It may not be quite as compelling as the others because, although three of the minifigs are unique to this set (I believe), they are not particularly interesting. But it&#39;s an attractive set that offers many play possibilities.</p>

<p>Old-hands like me who have the original Western themed sets from 1996 with its sheriff&#39;s office and bank might be disappointed that this is &#39;more of the same&#39;, but I guess they were released&nbsp;some 17 years ago now, before half of you reading this were born, so that&#39;s probably not of consequence.</p>

<p>This concludes the Lone Ranger reviews that I&#39;ll be writing, I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed them.&nbsp;DrDave has <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79108-1"" title=""View set details"">79108</a> <em>Stagecoach Escape</em> and will hopefully be reviewing that over the weekend.</p>

<p><em>Many thanks to Kim at LEGO for sending them to us for review!</em></p>
