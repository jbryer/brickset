Not only has LEGO made dedicated mining themes&nbsp;<span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Rock%20Raiders"">Rock Raiders </a>and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Power%20Miners"">Power Miners</a>, and also <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Mining"">mining City sets</a>, but it seems that every licensed theme contains a mine or underground cavern of some sort, from <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7199-1"" title=""View set details"">7199</a><em> Indiana Jones Temple of Doom</em> to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9473-1"" title=""View set details"">9473</a> <em>Lord of The Rings&nbsp;The Mines of Moria</em>. We&#39;ve also had <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7036-1"" title=""View set details"">7036</a><em> Dwarves&#39; Mine </em>and in the original Western theme the bandits hid out in a gold mine in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6761-1"" title=""View set details"">6761</a>.</p>

<p>So, Silver Mine Shootout joins a rapidly growing collection of such sets, and having built it, it&#39;s clear that it shares design similarities with many of its predecessors.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>Another cracking box cover! The box is almost square, 35 x 37 cm and, at 9 cm deep, much deeper than other comparably sized boxes.</p>

<p>As usual the back illustrates what parts move and suggests ways to play with the set.</p>

<p>Inside, there&#39;s six numbered bags, a polythene bag containing large parts, and...</p>

<p>...two instruction manuals, a sticker sheet with 4 stickers and a plastic &#39;waterfall&#39;, which you&#39;ll see later.</p>

<p>Here are some of the interesting parts in bag one, and the polybag: a dark tan BURP, a brown slide which is probably the same as those that appear in pink in Friends sets, dark grey old-school rails, silver ingots, dark tan double-cheese and 1 x 4 trans-clear tiles, of which there are eight in total.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Bag one contains the minifigs and various other sub-assemblies that are added to the model as you&nbsp;build it. Construction of the mine itself begins in earnest with bag two.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that they&#39;ve used normal 6-wide train track, but then put the old-school rails on it to make it 4-wide. I can&#39;t think of any good reason for that other than stability and ease of construction. Unless, of course,&nbsp;a dual gauge track is needed for different sizes of mine trains...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8573951513/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" height=""421"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8573951513_dbcd03e9b8.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The mine cart is an upside-down lid of a large treasure chest. Note the &#39;water feature&#39; taking shape, which is made of medium blue plates,&nbsp;1 x 4 trans-clear tiles and cheese. The push-rod on the left is used to&nbsp;get the mine cart moving.</p>

<p>Bag three builds the right hand side of the base of the structure.</p>

<p>The barrel on the left can be rotated to...</p>

<p>Bag four&nbsp;builds upwards...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8573952795/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" height=""387"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8573952795_07231804b2.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>...and adds the slide which provides a means of getting from the top floor into the mine cart.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8573953091/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" height=""421"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8573953091_cffa5a99c8.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>The &#39;water feature&#39; is now finished, the plastic &#39;waterfall&#39; part hangs vertically and, with a slit in it, presumably minifigs can walk through it, perhaps re-enacting a scene&nbsp;in the movie?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8573953309/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8573953309_f947908851.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 524px;"" /></a></p>

<p>Bag five continues the build upwards, and the crane, built in bag one, is added. The push-lever you can just see on the left, and in the pictures above can be pushed in to &#39;blast&#39; out the small BURP above the waterfall.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8575046566/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8575046566_2aa3cc10c0.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 511px;"" /></a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve just noticed the boulder by the crane&nbsp;shouldn&#39;t be where it is: it&#39;s supposed to be precariously perched&nbsp;in the gap in the wall on the left - see the pictures&nbsp;below where it&#39;s in the correct position.</p>

<p>Bag six contains&nbsp;a nice surprise: this skull and new style of horn!</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8575047046/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8575047046_b55ca387bf_m.jpg"" style=""width: 293px; height: 200px;"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8575047208/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8575047208_45beebb4be_m.jpg"" style=""width: 255px; height: 200px;"" /></a></p>

<h2>The finished model</h2>

<p>Just the office&nbsp;with fireplace&nbsp;to be added from bag six and it&#39;s done. The skull, as you can see, is mounted above the office window, some sort of trophy, perhaps? There are not many stickers in the model: one is used for the &#39;Keep out&#39; sign at the front of the track, and three are used on the office roof for texture, which I haven&#39;t applied.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8575047470/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" height=""487"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8098/8575047470_e7ef98812e.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>

<p>Turning the lever above the slide raises the hinged trap-door which hits the boulder and causes it to topple over the office roof. The desk in the office has a set of weighing scales (two&nbsp;frying pans handle-to-handle)&nbsp;on it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8573954769/"" title=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79110 Silver Mine Shootout"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8573954769_4a34ed29c2.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 510px;"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>As you can see, this set bears more than a passing resemblance to previous mines: it shares the same overall design as <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7036-1"" title=""View set details"">7036</a> Dwarves&#39; mine and&nbsp;features a raised office like the original Western mine, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6761-1"" title=""View set details"">6761</a>. But it&nbsp;does have some unique and interesting features like the waterfall and slide. It&#39;s also chock-full of useful tan, dark tan, grey and brown bricks, plates and slopes.</p>

<p>It was an interesting and, actually, quite a challenging build, due to the number of small slopes added throughout the process. More often than not I&#39;d have a few left over at the end of a bag and I&#39;d have to go back and figure out where they were supposed to go :-)</p>

<p>I believe the price is going to be &pound;70 in the UK and probably $70-80 in the USA, so once again it seems pretty good value.</p>

<p>The minifigs (in<span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span> <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=6034"">part 1 of the review</a>) are excellent as is the mine itself so, unfortunately, this will be another one to add to your &#39;want list&#39;. It&#39;s turning out to be an expensive year again, isn&#39;t it...</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2013-04-18T15:01:31.683Z","Silver mining playbook.","<div>It's going to be hard - if not impossible - for me to write a review that's as effective as Huw's, but, having anticipated and just built this set, I thought that I might offer a few opinions of my own on Silver Mine Shootout, certainly one of the most impressive sets from the new Lone Ranger license. Following in the vein of <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean"">Pirates of the Caribbean</a> and the (now obscure) <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Prince%20of%20Persia"">Prince of Persia</a> themes, it seems that LEGO/Disney are pretty keen on partnering up with each other when it comes to their live-action franchises (a number that continues to grow when you consider that Star Wars and Marvel Comics are all under Mickey's thumb too). It's hard for me to say who the Lone Ranger - both the film and the LEGO sets - is targeting here, and I think that LEGO opted to choose a kind of middle ground between something that might be overly child friendly versus something that would be too fiddly for kids.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What I mean is that LEGO has done an admirable job of straddling the demarcation between sets with a lot of large, ""juniorised"" pieces (Pirates of the Caribbean) versus the forced asceticism of, say, a modular building. Silver Mine Shootout won't impress you with innovative techniques, but it is, surprisingly, sufficiently challenging that you'll feel like you got your money's worth. At the same time, the final build looks great, and it's also got a ton of features for the few odd folks who actually play with their toys.</div><div><br></div><div>There's little need for me to harp on the Minifigs any further when they have already been photographed so beautifully. The ""cowboys"" are a great throwback to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Western"">Western</a> theme from the mid-nineties, and that ""Natives"" have similarly been much improved upon (though I must comment that I know I'm not the only one who feels uncomfortable with Johnny Depp playing a rather stereotypical ""Indian"", however competent an actor he might be). Five Minifigs does feel a little low for a set of this size, though I might have been spoiled by the generosity of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings"">Lord of the Rings</a> line. By the way, I didn't notice this before, but the guns seem to be new moulds - or different from the old revolvers, at least. They're much sleeker and overall pretty cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With the exception of a few small rock-like walls that can be blown away via various mechanisms, the entire mine is one continuous construction. (On the subject of rocks: I feel that the designers tried so hard to hide the use of BURPs that they may as well have just not included them!) I don't know how this escaped my attention prior to buying this, but the mine is built on top of standard LEGO train tracks, which means that it can easily become a cohesive setpiece together with the Constitution Train (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=79111-1"">79111</a>) - or any other train, for that matter. One thing you will also notice during the construction is that the directions require you to rotate the model - a lot! The implication here is that there is just as much stuff hidden behind the mine's facade as there is on the front, which I always like. At the same time, there is also ample space for Minifigs to be positioned, which is great for display purposes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While a comparison with Dwarves' Mine (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7036-1"">7036</a>) is probably inevitable, I would also have to say that any comparison made is bound to be a favourable one. Both mines feature a fantastic number of gimmicks: in Silver Mine Shootout, there are two walls that can be ""blown up"", a hidden cavern behind a waterfall, a crane, a minecart, a slide, and even a variation on the ol' flick-fire missile, which I feel is more of a running joke than an actual play feature nowadays. Much like Goblin King Battle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=79010-1"">79010</a>) from the Hobbit line, I feel that these play features are very subtly included in the build itself, and I do commend LEGO for that. The advantage that Silver Mine has over Goblin King Battle is that it sacrifices ""chaos"" in favour of a single, completely-attached build - both have their pros and cons, of course.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I can't say that I'm an incredibly big fan of the Lone Ranger or the upcoming movie (in fact, I know almost nothing about it), but I do have fond memories of the Western line and find Silver Mine Shootout to be a fantastic approximation of it - which was probably one of the more obvious goals of LEGO taking on this license. It's a fun build with a lot of features, so much so that you might accidentally find yourself playing with some of them. If you like(d) Western or even more naturalistic builds in general, you'll probably have a good time with this set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-04-03T01:38:24.36Z","An Upgraded Mine for your Western Display","<p><strong>Set #79110 Silver Mine Shootout:</strong> The Lone Ranger Theme is one of those themes that was a welcome change from the typical stuff LEGO has been putting out. It brought back a classic Western look and introduced some great set designs and Mini-Figs. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think it was as well received as it could have been. Still it&#39;s sold pretty well and is being retired this year, so if you&#39;ve been waiting for it to go down in price you may want to pick this one up. And here&#39;s why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set looks great, although it is one of those odd shaped boxes that is a bit wider and thicker than your typical LEGO boxes. The design for this Theme&#39;s boxes was really great, and had a very impressive eye catching look to it. I enjoy when LEGO makes Theme boxes that stick out on the shelf as unique looking. LEGO City and other in-house Themes sometimes have weaker designs, or just a blander more uniform look that doesn&#39;t really&nbsp; attract your attention much.</p>

<p>This set includes cardboard protection for it&#39;s instruction manuals, there are two numbered instructions and six numbered bags. I like the look of this Themes instructions are good, but not great. I&#39;m still a bit dissapointed that they did not include Mini-Figure checklists in this Theme&#39;s manuals. The step-by-step build of this thing is fun though and easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Way too many parts to mention individually here, great colours and loads of tan parts.The most impressive and biggest draw of this set I feel is the mine cart, mine rails and cow skull as well as the new silver bar pieces. Definitely a lot of great parts for MOC fans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five Mini-Figures come in this set, the staples of course; Tonto and The Lone Ranger, plus three unique characters. Although one is also found in Colby City Showdown.</p>

<p>First we&#39;ll cover the common characters. Tonto and The Lone Ranger are pretty much the same found in all the other sets with one notable exception, their printing is different showing dust and scuff marks from being inside the Mine. These are great differentiated prints that make the two stand out quite nicely compared to all the other versions that are completely identical aside from Tonto&#39;s accessories. The Lone Ranger in this set comes with his two&nbsp; silver pistols. Tonto in this set has his tomahawk again, which is a nice accessory.</p>

<p>This set also features Chief Big Bear, another native american character. It&#39;s nice to see this character included here as we don&#39;t really have enough natives across the sets, I mean Tonto is pretty much it for army building fodder to have a bunch of Comanche helping the Lone Ranger. He has a pretty good print here with a double-sided torso and facial print (one side scared the other normal) and has a nice new hairsculpt that looks great. He has a quiver and bow for accessories and that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Butch Cavendish is one of the main villains in the film and here he&#39;s in charge of the Silver Mine. His print is really impressive here and his hat is a great new sculpted piece that includes the long sgraggly looking hair underneath it, which is a great sculpt here. I believe he&#39;s also in the background in the LEGO Movie during the western scenes, which is pretty cool. He has a black pistol for an acessory, which looks great.</p>

<p>Kyle is one of Cavendish&#39;s thugs who has a nice looking print as well and a red scarf to cover his face. He has a standard western rifle as an accessory and a brown cowboy hat. I find him to be the least memorable from the set though, just your generic baddie for fighting the two heroes and their ally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This model is a truly satisfying build, it uses six numbered bags and takes it&#39;s time to build up the mine, there are a lot of play features in this build and some great design choice, making it look like an old style mine complete with wooden structures jutting out. I found the building of the model to be extremely fun and not too repetitive, aside from the mine tracks being a bit similar from one side to the other for the mine entrance on the bottom.</p>

<p>I recommend building this on a hard surface though, it isn&#39;t something to build on a bed or other soft surface, especially as you&#39;re working on the bottom of the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Everything about this model is just awesome, from the clever build for the small waterfall on one side to the cabin area on the second level with the cow skull piece. The mine cart feature and the large slide leading into it is just icing on the cake, and with more train tracks you can expand the mine if you were so inclined.</p>

<p>The model has a really large number of play features too, you&#39;ve got the slide and the mine cart that work in tandem (you can knock Mini-Figs down the slide into the cart and then flick a Technic pin launching the cart out through the entrance), which is pretty fun. You can &#39;blow-up&#39; two seperate sections of the mine, one in the front where the water fall is (which has a dynamite piece underneath it explaining the explosion feature) and you&#39;ve got an explosive wall in the back underneath the cabin section on the ground floor.</p>

<p>A catapult to launch dynamite at the Ranger is included, which is pretty standard, you also have a trap-door/boulder launching section on the top of the mine which is a fun (though slightly weak) feature. The boulder likes to fall far too easily more often than not.</p>

<p>The cow skull is actually&nbsp;a flick-fire missile. *SIGH* LEGO do we really need that in this set? I mean honestly there are enough features for fighing with your Mini-Figures do you honestly need a stupid flick&nbsp;fire missile in this set?</p>

<p>The top of the mine also has a winch and bucket feature that is, in my opinion, the weakest feature. Honestly the bucket used here just doesn&#39;t want to hold a Mini-Figure properly, in the images on the box Cavendish is actually standing in the bucket, this is impossible. Any Mini-Figure you put in there will make the bucket top heavy sending your figure topling out of it before you can winch the thing up or down from its resting place. So it&nbsp;doesn&#39;t really work right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this and the Constitution Train Chase are two of the most impressive and must own sets from the Theme, aside from the Stagecoach. This set has a decent number of Mini-Figures with some unique prints for Tonto and The Lone Ranger, is loaded with play features (some of which don&#39;t work out as well as others) and looks great as a display piece. I think it&#39;s a pretty decent improvement over the original LEGO Western Mine set.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set for fans of Western Themes and designs.</p>
