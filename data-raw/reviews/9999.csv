"xboxtravis7992","2013-05-06T15:32:23.8Z","Full Steam Ahead ","<p>Set 79111 Constitution Train Chase was the first Lone Ranger set to be revealed, and remains one of the most spectacular sets in the line.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions and DSS were not cardboard backed, so they curled a little bit.</p><p><b>Parts</b></p><p>Some standout pieces include the green bricks used to build the train's boiler and of course the large steam train wheels. The 20 pieces of rail included makes a great addition to any Lego train collection.</p><p><b>Minifigures</b></p><p>The seven Minifigures included are spectacular. Tonto and the Lone Ranger are good figures. Rebecca Reid and Danny Reid are both highly detailed and make good additions to any Western style figure collection. Butch Cavendish is appropriately nasty looking. Latham Cole is generic enough he could double as either an outlaw or a regular citizen. Captain J. Fuller has many uses from a brave Calvary leader, or as a corrupt soldier.</p><p><span><span><span><span>My only issue is Butch Cavendish's double sided head lacks his beard on one side! I cannot figure out if mine is a misprint our if he was only supposed to have a beard on one side.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build was rather basic lacking the complex surprises of the Exclusive Trains. However there are some nice SNOT moments which give the build a decent feel.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The most exciting part of the build is the finished Locomotive and Tender.</p><p>The two freight cars complement the train well, but feel very basic and are not that special. The trackside builds include a water tower and some exploding rocks which make a simple addition to the finished set.</p><p>However the most important question is how does the Constitution compare to previous Lego trains? Very well it turns out. I compared the set side by side with the Emerald Night our previous green steam train and the Maersk Locomotive, one of our previous American Locomotives. The issue with comparing it to the Emerald Night was the scaling between the two engines, the Night's boiler is a little to big and would have scaled better if it was similar in size to the Constitution. Of course the Night is a British engine and would most likely never have the chance to operate with an American engine like the Constitution (this does make the scaling more obvious though, since British engines are known for being very compact while American engines are known to be very large). However the Constitution scales perfectly with the Maersk engine, and it is easy to imagine the two operating at a historic tourist railroad together.</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>The Constitution makes a great train set, and serves as a good introduction to the Lone Ranger theme. I recommend the set.</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. I uploaded some review photos to my Brickshelf account.

His hat is a brand new mould and is cast in white, looking exceedingly accurate to the movie prop. The head piece is printed with a determined expression and John Reid's famous eye mask which looks perfect in my opinion. Some people have expressed a wish for a moulded component but I am happy enough with the printing.</p><p style=""margin: 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9352633341/"" title=""79111 Constitution Train Chase by Brickset, on Flickr.

Perhaps most important of all however is the silver badge which adorns his chest. The back of the torso is printed simply with some folds in the cloth, although this is a nice touch despite its simplicity. His legs are dark brown and printed with a continuation of his black jacket. Perhaps the most interesting of all the new parts to come out with the Lone Ranger theme however is the pistol, two of which come with the Lone Ranger here in metallic silver, and they look marvelous. Of course, the Lone Ranger is rarely without his horse, Silver, and he is included in the set, with poseable legs and head.</p><p style=""margin: 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;"">Another figure, who is almost as common as his counterpart, is the Native American&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Tonto</strong>. In a number of ways, this figure is similar to Captain Jack Sparrow released as a part of the Pirates of the Caribbean line. Firstly, both characters are of course played by Johnny Depp, furthermore, a brand new hair and hat piece was created for this Minifigure, and finally, each one comes equipped with a 1 x 1&nbsp;tile which is printed with a specific design. His hair and bandanna component is brilliantly detailed, cast in a rubbery plastic and complete with the rather notable dead crow which rests atop Tonto's head. Tonto's head is printed on both sides with two different expressions. On one side he grins, on the other he is afraid, but both share some rather lovely face paint which looks great.</p><p style=""margin: 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9352630211/"" title=""79111 Constitution Train Chase by Brickset, on Flickr.

On the back is some muscle definition and the rest of his belt. The legs are printed with some more of his ragged clothing and various pouches and Tonto carries two accessories, a rather nice pearl&nbsp;silver shovel and a pocket watch printed on a 1 x 1 tile, which he is equipped with in most sets in which he appears. All in all, another brilliant Minifigure.</p><p style=""margin: 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;"">Next is the apparent 'damsel in distress' in this scene,&nbsp;<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Rebecca Reid</strong>. Her hairpiece was first utilised for&nbsp;Princess Tamina in the Prince of Persia theme and is cast in dark brown, an appropriate mould and colour judging by stills from the film. Her face is unique to this character, quite a rarity among female LEGO Minifigures it has to be said. On one side is a frustrated expression and on the other is a frightened one. The torso is printed with a highly detailed dark red dress which is continued onto the slope piece which acts as her legs. The whole design is covered with tiny&nbsp;black dots and frills, and looks very elaborate all in all.</p><p style=""margin: 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;""><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9352642083/"" title=""79111 Constitution Train Chase by Brickset, on Flickr.

The head is printed with some freckles, which are a great touch,&nbsp;and one one side a smile, on the other is a screaming expression. His torso is detailed with a dark grey jacket and various pockets, on the back are simply a few creases in his jacket. His short legs are dark grey and not poseable. Danny is equipped with just a single accessory, a slingshot, which is printed on a 1 x 2 tile.

A brown cummerbund goes around his waist and this printing is continued onto his back and legs, where a golden belt and hanging sash are found. He comes with a sheath for his sword (first introduced in the Pirates of the Caribbean line) and a dark grey cutlass. I personally consider this Minifigure to be among the best I own, as the detailing is almost beyond compare and he looks fantastic when heading up a unit of his troops.</p></div><h2>The Build</h2>

<p>I&nbsp;enjoyed building this set, thanks in part to the fact that this is a train, and I always enjoy building LEGO trains. Plenty of SNOT is used throughout the model, most notably to create the boiler on the locomotive. The ingenious creation of the Gatling gun is also a treat. Although this design is prevalent in the world of MOCs, this is a rare technique to be&nbsp;used in an official set, only appearing three times before now. It is interesting to note that the designer of this set is Marcos Bessa, an AFOL, which suggests the design may have been influenced even more than usual by designs exhibited online as well as past LEGO sets.</p>

<p>There are a couple of notable examples of NPU as well. Naturally, the aforementioned binoculars on the Gatling gun, but perhaps even more interestingly, Sensei Wu's hat from the Ninjago theme is cast in pearl silver and attached to the front of the boiler to add texture to the model which looks fantastic.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>There is a lot to this set. The locomotive itself is very detailed with various pipes and lanterns. A cowcatcher features and even a bell is included which is formed using a pearl gold fez piece. There is space for a driver in the cab and the acronym T.C.R.R. (Trans-Continental Rail Road) adorns either side of the vehicle. The front two wheels can turn, while the three behind that are fixed. Perhaps the only slight flaw in the design here are the lack of coupling rods on the wheels, although I do not mind this too much personally.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9359400641/"" title=""79111 Constitution Train Chase by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79111 Constitution Train Chase"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3766/9359400641_ab82231ddb_n.jpg"" style=""height:211px; width:320px""></a></p>

<p>The next section to be built is the coal tender which can open up to hide a Minifigure inside and has a few black studs on the top to represent coal. All of the couplings on the train are made using the standard magnetic pieces&nbsp;of course.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9359424449/"" title=""79111 Constitution Train Chase by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79111 Constitution Train Chase"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/9359424449_a4c4988b79_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px""></a></p>

<p>The flatbed wagon is laden with all kinds of details, including a&nbsp;crate in a nougat shade which contains two silver ingots,&nbsp;two silver crystal pieces, and a green bottle. Behind this is the Gatling gun, which is mounted on a ratcheted turntable and can tilt up and down, to point just about anywhere. On the side is a handle which can be turned to twist the barrel, recreating the manner in which a Gatling gun fires. I must say, the inclusion of this on a train seems like overkill to me, but nevertheless this section of the model (as well as the rest of it) looks marvellous in my opinion.</p>

<p>The last section of rolling stock is the prison car at the back of the train. This is accessible by a sliding door on either side of the car and inside is a barred door into an area where a prisoner can be kept. The rear of the car can be blown off by pushing a lever on the roof, allowing the convict to escape and inside a sticker shows a tally of days spent in the cell carved into the wall, which is evidently twenty-eight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What really sets this train apart from many others is the inclusion of twenty pieces of track, four straight components and sixteen curved. A water tower also features which can be knocked down using a level (cleverly disguised as an explosive plunger)&nbsp;to block the track, spilling four blue cylinders which represent water. Perhaps the least interesting part of the entire set is the exploding pile of rocks, which is very simple but functional nonetheless. I should imagine that both of these functions will be taken from the scene in the film, but we will see.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Despite the film itself being reputedly awful, there is no doubt in my mind that the sets are superb in the main. In my view, the Constitution Train Chase surpasses all other sets in this theme by some distance. This is high praise indeed given what it is coming up against, however I think it is completely justified in that both the Minifigures and the model itself are absolutely brilliant, even more so&nbsp;when the price is taken into account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many train fans, the ability to motorise the set is key. Unfortunately, this is not a particularly simple task with this model as the locomotive is nowhere near large enough to house a battery box. Despite this however, instructions for how to&nbsp;add Power Functions to the model are given in the 24th issue of the&nbsp;BrickJournal magazine. Feel free to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/contact/?CapnRex101"">send me a message</a>&nbsp;for a scan of the relevant page.</p>

<p>The Minifigures are all extremely desirable, and trains are always popular, particularly when they are as impressive as this model is. The addition of track and a couple of trackside accessories only add&nbsp;to the excellence of the set and make this a real 'must have' model&nbsp;in my opinion, particularly if you are a train fan, in which case I can think of no better set than this.</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>5</strong> - Plenty of useful dark green,&nbsp;some silver ingots and the&nbsp;golden fez component make this set very attractive from a parts perspective.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>5</strong> - Trains are always good fun, and there are plenty of lovely features which only add to the playability.</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>4.5</strong> - A few interesting techniques are used, although without any moments of real inspiration, I cannot quite award&nbsp;full marks.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>5</strong> - No doubt that this set is well worth the price, it certainly feels as though you get a lot for your money.</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>5</strong> - Not quite faultless, but nigh on perfect for me in terms of Minifigures, the build and the set as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus that concludes the Brickset reviews of the Lone Ranger sets. Although this will almost certainly be a one wave theme, I must say that I (and the rest of the Brickset team judging by their reviews) have been very impressed with these sets overall. The Minifigures are about as good as one could hope and the models seem to have had a great deal of thought put into them. Only time will tell whether these sets prove popular, but from what I have heard from LEGO store employees this is not the case&nbsp;(in Brighton not a single Lone Ranger set was purchased on the day of release apparently).&nbsp;I certainly hope that the theme will grow in popularity however, if only to inspire LEGO to create a brand new&nbsp;unlicensed Western theme.</p>

"camaroman","2014-05-18T20:55:18.12Z","Good build experience, Great afterglow!","<p>This is another review of a set that was built after it left &quot;at retail&quot; status! And again I wish I had bought at least two for myself... Picked this two of these sets up a couple of weeks ago on ebay. One was for a coworker that wanted one for her grandson. Paid just a little over retail price,but it was worth it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty sturdy. Mine was shipped in a USPS game box that was a very tight fit! They both arrived in good shape!</p>

<p>The instruction were well done and easy to follow, but they were a bit damaged from not being in a bag with a cardboard stiffener.</p>

<p>Please LEGO take better care of these in the package!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts package was pretty good. My four year old grandson was happy to provide my with the next bag of parts that he knew would yield a new train car! Well done on the part separation!!</p>

<p>The parts themselves were great although color choice was a bit confusing on some of the hidden parts, such as&nbsp; there were some neat colors that ended up being unseen in the finished locomotive! I intend to go back a pull those for more common colors in the hidden spots! I really like the way the wheel assemblies were in separated packages. I do wish that a simple driver assembly was included in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs were separated into the different parts bags make it necessary to open almost all of the bags to retrieve them if that is all you are interested in.</p>

<p>The mini figs were well done and easy to build except the Tonto hairpiece/bird. You have to take care to not damage the bird putting it into the hairpiece. I do not recall this issue with the same bird in the scarecrow minifigure line a few years back</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was not a challenge, in spite of doing it in the presence of four year old grandson wanting to play ASAP! I did let him play with Maersk train on the track from the CTC box, though!</p>

<p>The locomotive was a great sub build! I thought the chassis, with its use of Technic pieces was a reasonable experience!&nbsp; The tender assembly was simple enough. I will rebuild soon&nbsp; future to accept a 9 volt train motor until I have the time to build a car to house power functions!</p>

<p>The other cars were built up from regular Lego pieces and train wheel sets.</p>

<p>These will be reconfigured in the future into passenger type cars using the cool freight style pieces from the gun car,&nbsp; in a combine car.</p>

<p>The gun car and exploding wall box car were a big hit with Luke!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model looks good, the locomotive being very well done! I love the dark green/black color scheme. It has a very prototypical look! The whole train tracks well for a push train.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love the set! My grandson really loved it! He played for over four hours after the build was finished! Good set for both kids play and a basis for train lovers to start a Lego train collection if they have not yet. Buy soon before the price gets astronomical !</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>I would have like to have seen the piece count in the exploding rock gone into the loco/tender in the dark green color pieces.</p>

"PeteM","2016-10-17T17:27:33.693Z","A Strong Constitution","<p>Despite not being the franchise-spawning&nbsp;smash hit film that&nbsp;Disney might have hoped for, the Lego Lone Ranger sets&nbsp;received generally positive attention from AFOLs&nbsp;upon release, not least because&nbsp;they&nbsp;harkened&nbsp;back to the spirit of the well-regarded Western theme from the mid 1990s. I&#39;m of the opinion that every theme is better with a train set in it and, with the highest piece count of any Lone Ranger set, the Constitution Train Chase nicely ticks this&nbsp;box, as well as being the &#39;flagship&#39; set of the range.&nbsp;The eye catching and dramatic&nbsp;box art is nicely done, and the instructions are split across two booklets - the first for the engine and tender, the second for the other wagons - and they take the build at a pace that is fitting for the 8-14 age recommendation.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s the usual array of train parts like magnetic couplings, wheel sets, boogie plates, as well the rarer pieces specifically for steam engines, such as a cow catcher front piece. Of particular note are the two sets of the large black train wheels, comprising of two flanged and one blind each, a welcome return for these following their introduction in the superlative <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10194-1/Emerald-Night"">10194</a> Emerald Night. The inclusion of track is appreciated, with four straight pieces as well as the sixteen curved pieces required to complete a loop. It&#39;s also a good source of dark green bow pieces in a couple of different iterations, as well as two dark grey sliding doors which have only appeared in a couple of older train sets in this colour. The rifle and pistol pieces included were produced especially for the Lone Ranger theme and have yet to appear elsewhere, as were some printed elements such as a pocket watch and a slingshot, the latter being unique to this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The inclusion of 7 minifgures&nbsp;is fairly generous - the Lone Ranger himself and his trusty (if eccentrically portrayed) sidekick Tonto are common to most sets in the range, but Butch Cavindish only had one other outing (in the not-significantly-cheaper <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79110-1/Silver-Mine-Shootout"">79110</a> Silver Mine) and the rest are unique to this set. All are as well designed as you would expect, with especially detailed printing for Rebecca Reid&#39;s elaborate red dress and Cavendish&#39;s outfit, both of which feature printing that seamlessly transitions between the torso and the lower half (slope brick and legs respectively). Butch (surely not the name his mother gave him?) also has a one piece hair-and-hat combo, as does Captain Fuller, though the latter&#39;s style makes him look like a slightly battered wizard from some angles... However, he does get to use the minifig sword holder previously unique to the Pirates of the Caribbean theme. By contrast, Latham Cole is the plainest printing-wise, but he does get to wear a natty bowler hat. Danny Reid features a detailed and smart torso print and, though there is no printing on the short legs provided, it does mean that he can always be placed in Hobbiton if you find him too annoying to use in this set.</p>

<p>The Lone Ranger would be nothing (or at least considerably slower to show up) without his stead Silver, who is portrayed using the relatively new mold introduced a year earlier with Lord of the Rings sets, allowing the horse to rear up on his hind legs - perfect for this character.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This provides an excellent starter&#39;s guide to building a steam engine chassis at the standard six-wide scale, especially the simple but effective build for the floating bogie which allows the front wheel arrangement to rotate so that the train can navigate around Lego&#39;s tightly curved track. There is nothing in the construction of the set to challenge most builders, with the limited SNOT work used for basic decoration rather than any dense or interesting building. There are some clever little sub-builds such as the bell and lamp on the engine, and the simple creation of the inverted conical funnel using two bricks and a Technic axle to join the two is a great introduction to the expanded possibilities offered by stud reversal. Also of note is the inspired use of a piece more usually seen atop Sensei Wu&#39;s head for the front plate of the engine boiler.</p>

<p>The most complex part of the build is probably the mechanism for Gatling gun, which includes more Technic elements to create the revolving gun barrel. This also includes some great parts usage with a circular arrangement of&nbsp;binoculars around a &#39;dalek&#39; brick to approximate the distinctive Gatling gun barrel.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>This set effectively captures the look of a vintage American steam locomotive, within the necessary restrictions of a &#39;typical&#39; Lego set. The greebling under and alongside the boiler is well done, with modified plates with protrusions subtly adding to the overall appearance just as much as the more obvious external decorations and rods that get clipped on. The wagons are fun additions and&nbsp;both the gun carriage and prison van provide&nbsp;great play opportunities, though with only two wagons the train is perhaps a little short - some kind of passenger carriage or brake van would have been welcome.&nbsp;The mechanism that triggers the exploding wall&nbsp;in&nbsp;the prison van is fun but&nbsp;maybe a little prominent - those who do not want to make use of the play feature may wish to&nbsp;remove it. It&#39;s a shame that there aren&#39;t any driving rods on the engine wheels, though some form of driving gear is possible if you have the parts and the inclination.</p>

<p>In keeping with the action nature of the film, both of the non-train features included blow up, though with varying success. The water tower is a solid representation of the structure and the tipping function works really well, with the top coming off and &#39;water&#39; (trans blue cylinders) spilling from the barrel. The exploding rock is good in theory but really needs to be braced against the track (which it is designed to be) and, even then, it sometimes flips over if the mechanism is triggered with too much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The lack of support for integration of Power Functions is a shame, though does mean that there are no design compromises required that might affect the overall look,&nbsp;as in the recent <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10254-1/Winter-Holiday-Train"">#10254</a> Winter Train. As an added bonus, the set also pairs nicely with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30260-1/Lone-Ranger-s-Pump-Car"">30260</a> Lone Ranger&#39;s Pump Car.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>This is a lovely and well designed set which almost manages to balance the demands of a variety of ages ranges and interests. In many ways it is more suitable as first train set than most of the City offerings -&nbsp;un-powered it actually offers more playability for the younger demographic. However, the build is skewed more towards the capabilities of an older child and the model, whilst not fragile, still has pieces that will explode all over the floor if exposed to too much rough handling from, say, a demented train-loving two year old... But while an older child would welcome the addition of&nbsp;Power Functions to control the set remotely, modifying the model to include them satisfactorily is a challenge that is maybe slightly above the age range suggested, though there are plenty of YouTube videos offering a variety of solutions for the curious.</p>

<p>However, there is no doubting that this is a well above-average train set from Lego - fun, engaging, and interesting on it&#39;s own terms, no matter what you think of the film that inspired it. Though not wholly unique, the only previous Lego examples of an American steam engine of the era have been a 12v train set from 1976 that is very much of it&#39;s time, and the Toy Story version from a few years ago, which is a toy train version of a toy train version of a train.</p>

<p>When the City train line consists of repeated variations on modern passenger and freight engines, and the Creator Expert trains appear to have been shunted off altogether, I&#39;m grateful that this license gave Lego a brief opportunity to produce a different kind of train, one that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. As such, it thoroughly deserves attention from those approaching it from a &#39;Wild West&#39; perspective, as well as from the more general train collector.</p>
